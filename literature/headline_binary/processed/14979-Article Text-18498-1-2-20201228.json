A distinguishing characteristic of news on social media is that the most prominent (and often the only visible) part of the news article is the headline. We investigate the impact of headline characteristics, including journalistic concepts of news values and linguistic style, on the article's social media popularity. Using a large corpus of headlines from The Guardian and New York Times we derive these features automatically and correlate with social media popularity on Twitter and Facebook. We found most of them to have a significant effect and that their impact differs between the two social media and between news outlets. Further investigation with a crowdsourced study confirms that news values and style influence the audiences' decisions to click on a headline.",

We have selected popular broadsheet news outlets, whose presence in the social arena is vital given the growing importance of social media as a source of news and the increasing appearance of fake news in the social space. Social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are becoming the main medium for news consumption. According to the latest report by Pew Research Center, 62% of the Americans get news on social media 5 . BBC reports that social media is young people's main source of news6 , which makes social media crucial to reach that demographic.",

Researchers have looked at their functions (Althaus, Edy, and Phalen 2001 ) and the role their play for information processing (Dor 2003) . Considerable attention has been paid to the language of headlines, in particular what sets them apart from other text types, e.g. passive transformation and nominalisation (Fowler 1991, p.77-79) , deliberate ambiguity (Br\u00f4ne and Coulson 2010) , and untensed verbs (Chovanec 2014) . Some researchers worked on identifying how higher level concepts, such as sensationalism (Molek-Kozakowska 2013), or click-bait (Blom and Hansen 2015) , are captured in the headline language. In our work we analyse the headline language directly (style features) and the linguistic expression of higher level concepts (news values features).",

The seminal work in this area is by Galtung and Ruge (1965) who propose a set of so-called news values as event properties which determine the space afforded to an event by news outlets. Other empirical work in the journalism community, using manual content analysis, confirmed the importance of news values for news selection (Kepplinger and Ehmig 2006) . In contrast, our aim is to explore the impact of news values on social media reception. A variety of news values taxonomies have been proposed, including: Gans (1979) , Bell (1991) , Harcup and O'Neill (2001) , and Bednarek and Caple (2012) . There is, however, considerable agreement between these taxonomies (Caple and Bednarek 2013) , allowing us to concentrate on the news values which are most frequently mentioned.",

Linguistic style has been previously used to model the popularity of short texts, such as Reddit image titles (Lakkaraju, McAuley, and Leskovec 2013) and tweets (Tan, Lee, and Pang 2014) . Some commonly used features include: ratios for various parts of speech, sentiment, and similarity to a language model. Headline text is a similar phenomenon, which brings its unique challenges. For example, since headlines offer limited context, word-level sentiment rather than contextsensitive state-of-the-art methods is often used (Tan, Lee, and Pang 2014; Gatti et al. 2016; Szymanski, Orellana-Rodriguez, and Keane 2016) . We adapt these frequently used features to work with headlines. We also draw from the news domain to implement features which were not explored for this task before. This includes syntactic and lexical simplicity (mentioned in news selection literature, e.g. Bell (1995) ) and implemented using features drawn from NLP research on readability (Pitler and Nenkova 2008; Feng et al. 2010; Kate et al. 2010) . Following advice on writing headlines from news style guides (e.g. The Guardian's style guide 7 ) we use punctuation and ambiguity.",

We extend previous work by using wikification for obtaining entities, which ensures a wide variety of entity types. The first feature is the number of entities identified in a headline. To gauge the online attention that an entity gets we consider two sources: entity mentions in headlines and Wikipedia page views. The news recent prominence feature is the number of entity mentions in headline of the relevant news outlet (The Guardian or New York Times). Since we are using wikification an entity corresponds to a Wikipedia page title. Using Wikipedia pageviews we look at long-term prominence (the median number of daily page views over a year for an entity) and day-before prominence (number of page views for an entity the day before a given headline was published). Finally, we consider how some entities have a bursty, i.e. non-steady, prominence. An entity is defined as being in a burst if its moving average of Wikipedia page views in a given time frame is above a predefined cut-off point (the burst detection algorithm we use has been adapted from Vlachos et al. (2004) ). We implement two featuresthe size of the current burst (how much above the cutoff point are an entity's page views) and burstiness (how many times over a year an entity has been in a burst). Since a given headline may feature multiple entities, all prominence measures are aggregated via summation over all entities.",

We use SentiWordNet (Baccianella, Esuli, and Sebastiani 2010) positivity and negativity scores of a headline's content words to combine them into sentiment and polarity scores (Kucuktunc et al. 2012) . We also look at indirect sentiment expressed via connotations and biased words. For example, a word may be in itself objective, but carry a negative connotation (e.g. scream). Using a connotations lexicon (Feng et al. 2013) we calculate the proportion of connotated words (positive or negative) to all content words. Secondly, using a bias lexicon (Recasens, Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, and Jurafsky 2013) we calculate the percentage of biased content words. For example, the same political organisation can be described as far-right, nationalist, or fascist, each of these words indicating a bias towards a certain reading.",

Conversely, Proximity which was associated with significantly lower social media popularity, had the highest proportion of positive responses. What could explain the differences in how news values and style are judged versus how they objectively influence popularity is that higher level concepts like Prominence or Proximity are more salient to readers than relatively technical concepts like nouns or adverbs. While style might not be perceived by readers to influence their choice of headlines (since headlines in news outlets should already be grammatical), it has a significant effect on social media popularity nonetheless. Furthermore, these differences might be due to a difference in the engagement with the headlinethe survey asked about clicking on a headline (private engagement), whereas the correlations target explicit social behaviour such as likes or retweets. Overall, both the survey and the experimental results confirm that news values and style influence a headline's popularity.",

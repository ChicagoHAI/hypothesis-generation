    "abstract": "Concreteness was investigated as a text feature that engaged readers' comprehension, interest, and learning in 4 text types: persuasion, exposition, literary stories, and narratives. Three concrete and 3 abstract texts were selected in each text type. Concrete and abstract titles served as recall cues and to investigate title concreteness effects. In 2 experiments, undergraduates read the texts and either provided written recalls or rated them for familiarity, concreteness, interestingness, and comprehensibility. Concrete texts were recalled better than abstract texts, although the magnitude of the advantage varied across text types. Concreteness was overwhelmingly the best predictor of overall comprehensibility, interest, and recall. Effects of title concreteness varied across text types. Results extend the findings of M. Sadoski, E. T Goetz, and J. B. Fritz (1993a B. Fritz ( , 1993b) ) and are consistent with dual coding theory.\nThe characteristics of text that best elicit engagement, comprehension, and memory are central to designers of text materials, content area teachers, and researchers interested in finding common theoretical principles in reading comprehension. Many characteristics have received attention, including the readability of the text (Klare, 1984) , the familiarity of the content (e.g., readers* prior knowledge; Anderson, 1994) , the interestingness of the text (e.g., Hidi & Baird, 1988; Wade & Adams, 1990) , and the concreteness of the text (e.g., Sadoski, Goetz, & Fritz, 1993a , 1993b) , among others (Sawyer, 1991) . The motivational state that these variables produce in readers has been referred to as engagement (Alvermann & Guthrie, 1993) , involvement (Reed & Schallert, 1993) , absorption (Nell, 1988) , and the reader's transaction (Rosenblatt, 1994) , among other terms. Various lines of research have produced rich sets of findings that have enlivened the scene of reading research in both basic and applied ways.\nA challenge confronting researchers in this area is finding a theory that will draw these results together under a set of psychological principles that are explanatory, are empirically adequate, and have broad, practical application. Dual coding theory, a general theory of cognition, has compared favorably on these grounds with other general theories of cognition in reading, such as schema theory and other common code theories (Sadoski & Paivio, 1994; Sadoski, Paivio, & Goetz, 1991) .

According to dual coding theory, there are three levels of processing or meaning. The representational level involves perception and recognition in either code (e.g., written words activating mental representations in the verbal code, printed pictures activating mental representations in the nonverbal code). Familiarity is an important text variable at the representational level. Hie associative level involves connections within a code, as when language is defined or meaningfully elaborated through its association with other language (e.g., an abstract word such as knowledge being understood by its association with related words like experience, concept, memory, facts, beliefs, etc.) . Context is an important text variable at the associative level. Reader engagement may be elicited at the associative level, as when we try to resolve the proper meaning of a word from its context, or when imagery elicited by related words is integrated into an imaginal episode. The referential level involves connections between codes. For example, a concrete phrase such as juicy hot dog may activate visual and perhaps taste images of frankfurters in buns, perhaps covered with condiments. Such images may be engaging, as in stimulating appetite. Language concreteness is an important text variable at the referential level.",

He found that imagery was reported when reading all text types, but far less imagery was reported for the abstract expository text than for any of the others. This study helped establish evidence for the spontaneous use of imagery in engagement across various text types, although it did not deal with comprehension, interest, or memory. Long, Winograd, and Bridge (1989) investigated the think-aloud reports of fifth graders reading complete poetic, narrative, and expository texts and found that imagery was reported consistently in all the text types and that spontaneous imagery was related to interest and engagement in reading.",

Sadoski (1983 Sadoski ( , 1985) ) had third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students read a complete story and then perform several comprehension and recall tasks, including a selfreport of any images they spontaneously experienced. Imagery of a key event in the story, its climax, was related to understanding the story's plot and theme, suggesting that story engagement, through the sensuous realization of key episodes in imagery, was related to deeper levels of understanding and memory. Sadoski and Goetz (1985) and Sadoski, Goetz, and Kangiser (1988) found with university students that reports of imagery and affective response followed a typical plot outline of story episodes and had a persistent correlation, even when the effect of the importance of the episode in the plot was statistically controlled (cf. Miall, 1988) . Sadoski, Goetz, Olivarez, Lee, and Roberts (1990) had community college students read a literary story and provide self-reports of their mental images and verbal recalls immediately and after a delay. They found that whereas verbal recall declined after the delay, imagery reports did not. A factor analysis of several imagery and recall variables produced factors dominated by imagery variables, suggesting that the experience of reading the story was a largely imaginal one. In a secondary analysis of some of these data, Goetz, Sadoski, and Olivarez (1991) demonstrated that the imagery ratings of one group predicted the imagery reports and recall of a second, independent group of readers, establishing convergent construct validity to these measures and findings.",

They found that the comprehensibility of the concrete sentences was more disrupted than the comprehensibility of the abstract sentences, but they also found that concrete sentences were recalled better than abstract sentences even when disrupted. They concluded that there is an inherent vagueness in abstract language that makes it more difficult to comprehend and remember. Wharton (1980) modified narrative passages from history textbooks to make them more concrete and image evoking, while holding readability constant. Undergraduates scored significantly higher on comprehension questions on the revised passages than on the original ones and also found them significantly more interesting and image evoking. Recall was not investigated. Sadoski and Quast (1990) had undergraduates read feature journalism articles from Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, and National Geographic and rate each paragraph for the imagery it evoked, the affective response that it evoked, or its importance to the text. They found that most paragraphs received moderate to high ratings, consistent with a journalistic style that strives for continuous engagement. However, in a delayed recall test, the most recalled paragraphs were those with higher imagery and affect ratings, but not higher importance ratings. They concluded that the aspects of the text that engaged readers' imagery and interest or emotion were remembered better than the aspects that were seen as objectively important.",

Within each text type, texts were selected and modified to differ in concreteness (i.e., concrete or abstract), while controlling for readability. Ratings of each text's familiarity, concreteness, interestingness, and comprehensibility were assessed, and relationships between the ratings were investigated. Cued recall of the texts was measured, and differences in recall of concrete and abstract texts in each text type were determined. Overall predictors of recall were investigated through causal modeling. The findings were designed to contribute to our theoretical and practical understanding of those variables or combinations of variables that are associated with more comprehensible, interesting, and memorable reading across text types.",

A degree of familiarity is assumed for comprehension; obscure texts are less comprehensible, whereas familiar texts may be more comprehensible (i.e., the familiar is not always meaningful). Concreteness and imagery are seen as indicators of another level of processing or meaning; concreteness invites dual coding of text in both verbal and nonverbal forms and consequent elaboration and improved comprehension. Therefore, familiarity and concreteness were cast as predictors of comprehensibility. Comprehensibility precedes interestingness in the causal chain because some degree of comprehension in reading previously unseen texts would assumedly occur before readers could have nonverbal reactions such as interest. Recall of texts after reading is the last step and may be variously affected by the four text qualities in the model.",

In the first step, for the regression of comprehensibility on familiarity and concreteness, R = .97, p < .0001. In the second step, for the regression of interestingness on familiarity, concreteness, and comprehensibility, R = .86,/? < .0001. In Step 3, for the regression of recall on all four ratings, R = .66, p < .023. The multiple regression coefficients at the respective steps in Sadoski et al. (1993a) were .91, .76, and .68. In path analysis, direct effects are indicated by the path coefficients, and indirect effects are indicated by the products of the path coefficients comprising the indirect paths. The sum of the direct and indirect effects is the effect coefficient (Pedhazur, 1982) . For example, the direct effect of concreteness on interestingness is .44. However, concreteness also exerts an indirect effect on interestingness through comprehensibility. This indirect effect is calculated by multiplying the direct effect of concreteness on comprehensibility (.81) by the direct effect of comprehensibility on interestingness (.37). Thus, .81 X .37 = .30. The sum of the direct effect (.44) plus the indirect effect (.30) is the effect coefficient (.44 + .30 = .74).

This suggests that tide concreteness may have some cuing effect, but concreteaess by itself may not be enough. The titles in this study, though thematically related to their texts, were not necessarily integrative (e.g., stating the main idea), nor did they contain any of the content words in the text. It may be that more direct verbal-associative connections between title and text or more integrative titles may prove useful along with concreteness. This deserves further research. However, these results may be idiosyncratic to this study: Experimental controls for readability and content word redundancy constrain any claims of generalizability of the title results. In any case, none of the title ratings were significantly correlated with overall recall.",

These results have considerable generalizability because they involve typical texts from four common text types over a range of naturally occurring readabilities. The results here can be compared with Sadoski et al. (1993a) , where 24-word sentences of historical narrative in a restricted readability range were submitted to an identical causal analysis. In that study, concreteness was also by far the most effective predictor of comprehensibility and recall but was about equally effective with familiarity and comprehensibility in predicting interest-ingness. The findings for concreteness are stronger in the present study, but the comparison suggests the possibility of some variations across text types. The major difference in the results of the Sadoski et al. (1993a) causal analysis with sentences from one text type and the present study with paragraphs from four text types is that concreteness and familiarity were more highly correlated in the present study. This had the effect of increasing the predictive value of concreteness on interestingness and recall and reducing the predictive value of familiarity on interestingness and recall.",

Dual coding theory assumes that concrete language promotes referential processing, the evocation of mental images related to that language. The consequent dual encoding of language in verbal and imaginal forms promotes elaboration, comprehension, and memory. Concreteness effects are not well explained by other general theories of cognition that have been applied to reading. In this study, concreteness was found to be nearly identical to the construct of comprehensibility; the more concrete the text was rated, the more comprehensible the text was rated in a near-perfect relationship. Overall, concrete texts were recalled overwhelmingly better than abstract texts matched for length, readability, and idea units. On average, concrete text was recalled 1.7 times better than abstract text, exhibiting the general additive effect suggested by dual coding theory. Two text types, literary stories and exposition (science and math), were on the low side of this average, possibly because readers spontaneously image to stories, regardless of the concreteness of the language, and because concrete science and math concepts can still evoke highly abstract principles. The causal analysis found concreteness to be overwhelmingly the best predictor of comprehensibility, interestingness, and recall (i.e., engagement). These findings replicate previous findings (e.g., Sadoski & Quast, 1990 ) in this area with more extended texts that were not experimentally manipulated.",

As a broad generalization, using more concrete language and content should have positive effects in making sentences and paragraphs of text more comprehensible, interesting, and memorable, where other factors such as readability are equal and representative of the text type. This generalization should not be taken to mean that concreteness norms for words should be applied mechanically and without judgment, like the worst examples of the application of readability formulas. Fortunately, intuition and judgment serve fairly well in selecting and modifying text for concreteness. The interrater reliability of untrained raters is quite high in discriminating more concrete from more abstract text. Nor should this generalization be taken to mean that all text can be rendered concrete or that abstract text should be eradicated from educational materials. Learners can and must learn to deal with abstraction. However, perhaps relatively few abstract concepts cannot be elaborated through concrete referents such as examples, metaphors, or educational demonstrations.",

Studying engagement and text type with brief texts poses interesting challenges. On the one hand, longer texts may produce more extensive reader engagement and may exhibit a broader range of text type characteristics (e.g., pro and con sides of an argument). Still, brief texts can produce intense reader response (e.g., epigrams, jokes) and can be the most crystallized form of a text type (e.g., haiku, which is 17 syllables long by definition). For practical reasons, researchers are often left studying engagement and text type with few longer texts or many shorter texts. The present study was of the latter type, but the results of the present study compare with those of the former type. For example, the variables most predictive of recall here bear similarity to those in Sadoski and Quast (1990) , where three full-length works of feature journalism were used. Goetz et al. (1991) investigated the prediction of the text ratings of one group of readers on the text recall of another group of readers for a complete literary story and found similar results. Continued research to investigate convergent results using several methodologies is warranted in this area.",

One explanation (9) for the observed inequality of outcomes is that the mapping from Bquality[ to success is convex (i.e., differences in quality correspond to larger differences in success), leading to what has been called the Bsuperstar[ effect (9) , or Bwinner-take-all[ markets (10) . Because models of this type, however, assume that the mapping from quality to success is deterministic and that quality is known, they cannot account for the observed unpredictability of outcomes. An alternate explanation that accounts for both inequality and unpredictability asserts that individuals do not make decisions independently, but rather are influenced by the behavior of others (11, 12) . Stochastic models of collective decisions that incorporate social influence can exhibit extreme variation both within and across realizations (4, 13, 14) , even for objects of identical quality (3, 15) . Unfortunately, empirical tests of these predictions require comparisons between multiple realizations of a stochastic process, whereas in reality, only one such Bhistory[ is ever observed.",

In real time, arriving participants were ran-domly assigned to one of two experimental conditions-independent and social influencedistinguished only by the availability of information on the previous choices of others. In the independent condition, participants made decisions about which songs to listen to, given only the names of the bands and their songs. While listening to a song, they were asked to assign a rating from one star (BI hate it[) to five stars (BI love it[), after which they were given the opportunity (but not required) to download the song. In the social influence condition, participants could also see how many times each song had been downloaded by previous participants. Thus, in addition to their own musical preferences, participants in the social influence condition received a relatively weak signal regarding the preferences of others, which they were free to use or ignore. Furthermore, participants in the social influence condition were randomly assigned to one of eight Bworlds,[ each of which evolved independently of the others. Songs in each world accumulated downloads only from participants in that world, and subsequent participants could only see their own world_s download counts.",

(i) The popularity of a song in the independent condition (measured by market share or market rank) provides a natural measure of the song_s quality, capturing both its innate characteristics and the existing preferences of the participant population. (ii) By comparing outcomes in the independent and social influence conditions, we can directly observe the effects of social influence both at the individual and collective level. (iii) We can explicitly create multiple, parallel histories, each of which can evolve independently. By studying a range of possible outcomes rather than just one, we can measure inherent unpredictability: the extent to which two worlds with identical songs, identical initial conditions, and indistinguishable populations generate different outcomes. In the presence of inherent unpredictability, no measure of quality can precisely predict success in any particular realization of the process.",

In the social influence condition in experiment 1, the songs, along with the number of previous downloads, were presented to the participants arranged in a 16 \u00c2 3 rectangular grid, where the positions of the songs were randomly assigned for each participant (i.e., songs were not ordered by download counts). Participants in the independent condition had the same presentation of songs, but without any information about previous downloads. In experiment 2, participants in the social influence condition were shown the songs, with download counts, presented in one column in descending order of current popularity. Songs in the independent condition were also presented with the single column format, but without download counts and in an order that was randomly assigned for each participant.

Figure 1 displays the effects of social influence on market inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient (19) (other measures yield similar results). In both experiments, we found that all eight social influence worlds (dark bars) exhibit greater inequality-meaning popular songs are more popular and unpopular songs are less popularthan the world in which individuals make decisions independently (light bars). Comparing Fig. 1, A and B , we also note that inequality increased when the salience of the social information signal was increased from experiment 1 to experiment 2. Thus our results suggest not only that social influence contributes to inequality of outcomes in cultural markets, but that as individuals are subject to stronger forms of social influence, the collective outcomes will become increasingly unequal.",

In each experiment, the average difference in market share (fraction of total downloads) for a song between distinct social influence worlds is higher than it is between different subpopulations of individuals making independent decisions (Fig. 2 ). Because these different outcomes occur even with indistinguishable groups of subjects evaluating the same set of songs, this type of unpredictability is inherent to the process and cannot be eliminated simply by knowing more about the songs or market participants. Figure 3 displays the market share (left column) and market rank (right column) of each song in each of the eight social influence worlds as a function of its Bquality[ (i.e., its market share and rank, respectively, in the independent condition). Although, on average, quality is positively related to success, songs of any given quality can experience a wide range of outcomes (Fig. 3 ). In general, the Bbest[ songs never do very badly, and the Bworst[ songs never do extremely well, but almost any other result is possible. Unpredictability also varies with quality-measured in terms of market share, the Bbest[ songs are the most unpredictable, whereas when measured in terms of rank, intermediate songs are the most unpredictable (this difference derives from the inequality in success noted above). Finally, a comparison of Fig. 3, A and C , suggests that the explanation of inequality as arising from a convex mapping between quality and success ( 9) is incomplete. At least some of the convexity derives not from similarity of preexisting preferences among market participants, but from the strength of social influence.",

Although these differences limit the immediate relevance of our experiment to realworld cultural markets, our findings nevertheless suggest that social influence exerts an important but counterintuitive effect on cultural market formation, generating collective behavior that is reminiscent of (but not identical to) Binformation cascades[ in sequences of individuals making binary choices (20) (21) (22) .

All differences are significant (P G 0.01) (18) . they will seem to display regarding their musical preferences; thus the characteristics of success will seem predictable in retrospect. On the other hand, looking across different realizations of the same process, we see that as social influence increases (i.e., from experiment 1 to experiment 2), which particular products turn out to be regarded as good or bad becomes increasingly unpredictable, whether unpredictability is measured directly (Fig. 2 ) or in terms of quality (Fig. 3 ). We conjecture, therefore, that experts fail to predict success not because they are incompetent judges or misinformed about the preferences of others, but because when individual decisions are subject to social influence, markets do not simply aggregate pre-existing individual preferences.",

Whereas experimental psychology, for example, tends to view the individual as the relevant unit of analysis, we are explicitly interested in the relationship between individual (micro) and collective (macro) behavior; thus we need many more participants. In order to ensure that our respective worlds had reached reasonably steady states, we required over 14,000 participants-a number that can be handled easily in a Web-based experiment, but which would be impractical to accommodate in a physical laboratory.

Chodaparambil, 2 * Brenna Kelley-Clarke, 1 Vladimir Joukov, 3 Johannes C. Walter, 4 Karolin Luger, 2 Kenneth M. Kaye 1 \u2020 Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) mediates viral genome attachment to mitotic chromosomes. We find that N-terminal LANA docks onto chromosomes by binding nucleosomes through the folded region of histones H2A-H2B. The same LANA residues were required for both H2A-H2B binding and chromosome association. Further, LANA did not bind Xenopus sperm chromatin, which is deficient in H2A-H2B; chromatin binding was rescued after assembly of nucleosomes containing H2A-H2B. We also describe the 2.9-angstrom crystal structure of a nucleosome complexed with the first 23 LANA amino acids. The LANA peptide forms a hairpin that interacts exclusively with an acidic H2A-H2B region that is implicated in the formation of higher order chromatin structure. Our findings present a paradigm for how nucleosomes may serve as binding platforms for viral and cellular proteins and reveal a previously unknown mechanism for KSHV latency. K aposi_s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has an etiological role in Kaposi_s sarcoma (KS), the predominant AIDS malignancy; primary effusion lymphoma (PEL); and multicentric Castleman_s disease (1) (2) (3) (4) . KSHV persists as a multicopy episome in latently infected tumor cells (5, 6) . Viral genomes lack centromeres, which govern faithful DNA partitioning in eukaryotic cells, and use a distinct segregation mechanism in which the 1162-amino acid KSHV latencyassociated nuclear antigen (LANA) tethers episomes to mitotic chromosomes. LANA is required for episome persistence, and interaction with mitotic chromosomes is essential for its function. The first 22 residues comprise the dominant LANA chromosome-association region, because the C-terminal chromosome tar-geting domain is unable to rescue chromosome association in mutants that are deleted for or contain specific mutations within the N-terminal region (7) (8) (9) (10) . We therefore sought to determine the chromosome docking partner of the LANA N terminus.Genetic analysis of LANA_s chromosome binding region was central to our strategy for characterization of putative docking partners. Transient assays have shown that alanine substitutions at LANA residues 5 to 7 Eoriginal amino acids were GMR (11)^, 8 to 10 (originally LRS), or 11 to 13 (originally GRS) (termed LANA 5 GMR 7 , LANA 8 LRS 10 , and LANA 11 GRS 13 , respectively) (Fig. 1A ",

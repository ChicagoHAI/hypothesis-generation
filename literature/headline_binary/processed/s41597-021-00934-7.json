As Upworthy changed its editorial practices, and other media organizations imitated their approach, social media platforms also changed their algorithms. In 2016, Facebook announced that it had adjusted the recommendation algorithms that ranked items on users' News Feeds to reduce the visibility of content in styles attributed to Upworthy 5 . In 2017, Upworthy merged with Good Worldwide, the company which shared their historical data with us to create the Upworthy Research Archive 6 .",

The stimuli being tested, the large number of experiments, and the context of Upworthy's ascendancy in U.S. media make it a fruitful source for scholars across these disciplines. For each arm of an experiment, the Archive includes variables recording the date, number of clicks, number of impressions, and the text of the headlines; it does not include sales data, micro-level user data or advertising data. In political science and communication, the act of \"clicking\" is increasingly seen as a key but understudied component of the process by which an individual's (political) media diet is constructed 7 . In psychology and marketing, scientists are interested in people's preferential responses to stimuli that engage with reasoning and emotion. Computer scientists and statisticians formalize and create algorithms to process high volume flows of causal data and adapt in response. In business and organizational behavior, researchers study regimes of experimentation and how innovators use evidence to inform future decisions.",

As a result, much of the methodological research from large-scale corporate experimentation has been conducted by a small number of well-connected scholars (see, for example [10] [11] [12] ).

For this particular test, 3 different headlines were compared and the image was kept constant. method 18 to randomly assign the browser session to receive a given package, incorporating the package into the web page provided to the browser. The suspected exception to this randomization procedure took place between June 25, 2013 and January 10, 2014. During this period, we believe the website was verifiably randomizing experiment arms, but that the web cache that handled high volume requests was only serving one arm at a time. Upworthy only conducted one experiment at a time across the entire website, and pages never included more than one experiment. Packages were sometimes placed at the bottom of a page, outside the initial phone or desktop viewscreen and late in the reading order for audio screen-readers.

For example, if an article about a celebrity was widely shared and viewed on a given day, then people who tended to admire that celebrity would temporarily constitute the majority of test participants. If that article was no longer popular the next day, then an experiment the next day might have different demographics. Upworthy staff explained this belief by describing how readers arrived at articles where they encountered A/B tests. Readers often accessed Upworthy by following links on social media, culminating a sequence of selection processes that could lead to variation in participant characteristics between tests. This selection process was noticed by editors at moments when a single article was receiving disproportionately more readers than other articles, making that article's readers a majority of experiment participants. Since many of Upworthy's readers arrived on the site through social media, these participants were people whose social contacts had shared the article and who had chosen to follow the link. While we do not have quantitative evidence to confirm this belief, we report it as an important detail to consider when interpreting the experiments in the archive.

Since this dataset reports findings from production software that might occasionally have experienced errors, we encourage researchers to pursue questions that incorporate many experiments across the exploratory and confirmatory datasets. For instance, researchers could conduct two rounds of exploratory analyses using the smaller datasets and then confirm their key findings in the much larger dataset (or use the exploratory results as the basis for a registered report). Conversely, the larger dataset could be used for high-powered exploration, and then the robustness of discoveries could be tested in the smaller datasets. If a researcher has strong a prioi hypotheses, they could simply utilize the full dataset in order to produce the most high-precision estimates of their hypotheses. Finally, those interested in meta-scientific research could give other researchers the datasets in stages to observe how hypotheses and analyses evolve with sequential testing. Overall, the data partitions provide several options for conducting multiple tests of research questions. We encourage researchers to use the datasets in an order that best supports their research goals (i.e., prioritizing exploration vs. confirmation).",

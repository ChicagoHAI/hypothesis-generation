However, little is known about what generalizable factors in headlines and other promotional messages are actually effective at increasing engagement. As we discuss next, a large academic literature has studied factors that relate more generally to people's attention, persuasion and action, but the theories have generally been developed in very different contexts and it is often unclear whether and how the findings generalize specifically to strategies for optimizing engagement.",

These tactical \"A/B tests\" are designed to identify the bestperforming policy in each specific setting, such as which of multiple possible headlines will generate the most clicks on an article. Making decisions this way requires large-scale experimentation (e.g., separately testing headlines for each article, one at a time), which has been widely adopted by many online content providers, due to the relatively low cost per experiment. This approach can be contrasted with a \"consumer insights\" strategy, in which firms attempt to identify general principles that can guide better decisions, including how to write effective headlines. Large-scale industry experimentation, despite the potential for identifying causal drivers of consumers' behavior, has tended to not vary factors strategically in a way that would foster drawing such broader conclusions. As a result, there is little evidence that firms have used large-scale experimentation for discovery of general principles, such as the key factors underlying successful headlines, that would build institutional knowledge and improve best practices.",

We use data from thousands of experiments conducted by Upworthy, which each varied the language used in headlines for a given piece of content to find the most effective version. We use natural language processing tools and factor analysis to generate constructs capturing the difference between headlines and map those constructs to testable predictions in the prior academic literature. Unlike some recent work on text analysis in marketing, our goal is more focused on theory testing than optimizing prediction, which is why we use measures that map to psychological constructs, rather than using more flexible but potentially less interpretable machine learning approaches.",

A great deal of prior research, across different aspects of the behavioral sciences, is potentially relevant to this question. The process of evaluating a message (in this case, a headline) yields a wide array of potential cues to the person making the evaluation, including the directly stated and implied components of the message, the experience of processing the message, and the affective and motivational consequences.

In this view, headlines will not differ in the substantive signals they send readers about the content and non-substantive cues (e.g., \"framing\") will not impact decisions.

This also suggests that signals sent to consumers may vary substantively in the information sent (within some reasonable range) about the implied content, since consumers will not necessarily react optimally to punish mildly inaccurate representations in a message. The phrasing of a descriptive message, such as a headline, can then have a substantial impact on consumers' decisions and firms face the risk of suboptimal outcomes due to promoting their content with ineffective messages.",

In this section, we identify content-based differences in message composition that can result in different cognitive cues that may impact consumers' motivation to engage. The content of a message, especially in an online context, is important in determining what persuades people to learn more about the message (Guadagno & Cialdini 2005; Duthler 2002; Sagarin et al. 2003) .",

In particular, people typically comprehend information in terms of causal relationships (Murphy and Medin 1985) , and find insight rewarding (Skaar & Reber 2020) , and objective arguments can be an effective tool (e.g., in television advertising, Deighton et al. 1989 ). Messages conveying deliberation-relevant cues are likely to be motivating, to the degree they suggest that the content will provide an opportunity for meaningful deliberation. However, if the implied deliberation is perceived as not meaningful or as too demanding relative to the available mental resources, then the content may be perceived as boring (Westgate & Wilson 2018 ) and avoided.",

Specific linguistic factors that contribute to fluency may also have separate effects as well like grammatical structures that make sentences more complex -e.g., the use of conjunctions and different verb categories. Also, while unfamiliar words are less fluent, they are more distinctive and hence have more positive effects on memory (Pogacar et al. 2018; Hulme et al. 1991; Lerman & Garbarino 2002; Meyers-Levy 1989) .",

People tend to think of concepts that are in the present, physically near, certain and relating to the self or close others more concretely than when the concept is psychologically distant in terms of risk or physical, temporal or social distance (Liberman & Trope 1998) . Thus, whether concreteness or abstractness is preferred may also vary depending on psychological distance, such as how close a consumer is to making a product purchase (Lambrecht & Tucker 2013; Horsky et al. 2004 ). In the setting of headline reading, the proximity to consuming the content suggests that concrete headlines would foster more engagement, although perhaps less so when cues in the headline signal psychological distance.",

Upworthy develops a package for each story on their website consisting of a headline, a subheading, and an image (e.g., see Fig. 1 ). Viewers access the content (article or video) by clicking on its link. To determine which package would be most successful, Upworthy adopted A/B testing practices to run numerous experiments. Matias & Munger (2019) describe Upworthy's experimentation processes: (Upworthy's) content management infrastructure was optimized to deploy packages, measure responses, and compare the probability of a viewer clicking on different potential packages for the same story. Upworthy conducted its experiments on the homepage and article pages of Upworthy.com, randomly assigning different readers to see different packages for the same story in recommendations to readers. Site engineers and editors reported in interviews that they allowed only one experiment per page to limit interference between experiments. The content management system recorded the number of participants that were shown a given package (impressions) and the number that clicked on the package (clicks). After a period of time, an editor would review a dashboard that reported the results and either conduct an additional experiment (potentially with new packages) or choose which package to finalize for a given article.",

Headlines with longer sentences, more difficult readability, and higher word count were clicked on more. However, consistent with the fluency literature, we saw that the presence of numbers in headlines increased click-through rates, while other aspects of fluency did not have significant effects.

This relationship has been suggested in prior literature, which posited that curiosity enhances critical thinking, increasing student engagement (Pusca & Northwood 2018) . We also find that the average positive effect of individual social cues varies depending on other cues. Specifically, in emotionally arousing headlines (\u00dfint= -.0002881, t(3345)=-3.91, p<.001) and headlines with trust-related words (\u00dfint= -.0002514, t(3345)=-2.55, p=.011) the impact of content related to socialization by individuals is reduced. Overall, these results suggest the findings in our primary analysis estimate average treatment effects that are likely to vary to some degree with other factors as opposed to a single generalizable treatment effect.

The textual cues we extract from the headlines using text analysis tools do predict click-through rates, overall. Our findings, which suggest that prompting curiosity through the use of forward reference and using deliberative processing, visual-sensory marketing, numeric fluency, and concreteness improve engagement, are consistent with the implications of prior research. We also identify other factors that make headlines more effective, including emotional intensity, past references, individual social cues and avoiding speaking directly to the reader, for which prior literature provided mixed predictions. However, we also find effects of other types of sensory marketing (excluding visual and auditory), positive emotion content and, perhaps most surprisingly, syntacticsemantic disfluency, that directly contradict prior research literatures.",

Researchers can use text mining to further validate and refine the specific dictionaries for those theoretical constructs that significantly predicted reader engagement in this paper, as well as potentially develop more precise text-based measures for constructs that were not significant predictors and attempt to develop new measures for any constructs from the literature that were omitted from our analyses. Despite the massive scope of the experiments we analyzed, our findings are constrained by the fact that all the experiments were conducted on the same platform. It would be beneficial to use the same approach to test the generality of the findings to the platform (e.g., such as using a headline dataset from a \"hard news\" site). Our approach in this paper could also be extended to test the impact of other types of text-behavior relationships, such as the effect of product description features on purchase likelihood.",

However, contrary to the common belief that the design of effective messaging is an \"art\" driven primarily by experience and intuition, our findings suggest that there are specific factors that systematically improve engagement, in ways that have not been reliably identified in the academic literature. These findings reinforce risk of relying on behavioral principles identified in completely different contexts for designing marketing messages and highlights the importance of testing multiple approaches and experimentally optimizing policies in the local context (Goswami and Urminsky 2020) . In this paper, we develop a general approach that firms who engage in large-scale A/B testing can use to derive systematic learning, aggregated over experiments, that can contribute to institutional learning and adopting marketing best practices in their context. Most LIWC2015 output variables are expressed as percentage of total words. There are six exceptions: word count (WC; raw word count), (WPS; mean words per sentence), and four summary variables: Analytic, Clout, Authentic, and Tone. Each of the summary variables are standardized composites based on previously published research. The composites have been converted to percentiles based on large corpora of texts described in the LIWC2015 Language Manual. Text Analyzer represents output variables as the sum of weights associated with each word in the entry (with 0 for words not in the lexicon and 1 for lexica which lack weights) divided by the number of words in that entry.",

Every other variable in this construct -personal pronouns, he/she, social words -had higher loadings on Factor 1 than 2. Since the loadings for male and female words on either factor seemed comparable (despite being higher for Factor 2), we combined them all into one factor instead of two. Similarly, for social interactions (plural) only affiliation words (i.e. interactions with reference to others) loaded onto Factor 1 more than Factor 2 (.7774 vs -.1153), but since the literature on narrative persuasion includes interactions among multiple people, we combined this variable with the others -they, family-related words, friendrelated words -into a single construct. Finally, for the construct of negative emotion, negative sentiment (from Text Analyzer) and sadness loaded higher on Factor 2 than 1 (Negative Sentiment: .3853 vs -.4523; Sadness: .4559 vs .8280). However, since the loadings are again comparable and also since in the literature, these variables are related to the concept of negative emotion, we combined them into a single construct along with negative emotion (from LIWC) and anger.

While recent research has shown that flexible machine learning approaches to text analysis can be highly informative and predictive (Tirunillai & Tellis 2014; Anderson & Simester 2014; Netzer et al 2019; Buschken & Allenby 2016), we will use pre-specified measures due to the importance of being able to map the measures back to theoretical constructs. The potential variables for inclusion are based on linguistic features (e.g., pronouns, verbs, adjectives), grammatical structure and word lists to capture psychological measures such as concreteness, readability and emotions (refer to the Online Appendix A for the full list of variables, examples, and additional details), enabling us to test a wide range of theory-driven hypotheses with the dataset. The development of the LIWC variables involved validation studies (e.g., in relation to subjective ratings of the concept being measured, Pennebaker and King 1999; Tausczik & Pennebaker 2010). LIWC variables have been used in over 120 studies",

    "abstract": "Purpose -The headlines of online news are created carefully to influence audience news selection today. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between news headline presentation and users' clicking behavior. Design/methodology/approach -Two types of unobtrusive data were collected and analyzed jointly for this purpose. A two-month server log file containing 39,990,200 clickstream records was obtained from an institutional news site. A clickstream data analysis was conducted at the footprint and movement levels, which extracted 98,016 clicks received by 7,120 headlines ever displayed on the homepage. Meanwhile, the presentation of these headlines was characterized from seven dimensions, i.e. position, format, text length, use of numbers, use of punctuation marks, recency and popularity, based on the layout and content crawled from the homepage. Findings -This study identified a series of presentation characteristics that prompted users to click on the headlines, including placing them in the central T-shaped zones, using images, increasing text length properly for greater clarity, using visually distinctive punctuation marks, and providing recency and popularity indicators. Originality/value -The findings have valuable implications for news providers in attracting clicks to their headlines. Also, the successful application of nonreactive methods has significant implications for future user studies in both information science and journalism.",

According to the Pew Research Center, 93 percent of American adults read news online at least occasionally, either via mobile or desktop devices (Katerina and Elisa, 2018) . Readers turn most frequently to social media and news organizations' websites and applications for news (www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/digital-news/). In China, the size of online news consumers has reached 663m, and 95 percent of them are mobile users (www.cnnic.net.cn/hlwfzyj/hlwx zbg/hlwtjbg/201808/P020180820630889299840.pdf ). An important fact found by the Chinese Online News Market Survey 2016 is that many people tended to read merely the news headlines or the news in the first screen and barely involved themselves in in-depth reading. This could be primarily attributed to the news explosion on the internet (www.cnnic.cn/hlwfzyj/hlwxzbg/mtbg/201701/P020170112309068736023.pdf ).",

Instead, it should at least be able to arouse users' curiosity about the news story, and sometimes it needs to entice them to click and open the news articles (Arapakis et al., 2014) . If a headline loses the competition for users' clicks, the news article will stay ignored despite its high quality (Kuiken et al., 2017) . News providers are thus striving to increase headline salience in virtue of visual cues, including both headline components (e.g. use of numbers and/or questions) and peripheral indicators (e.g. recency and/or popularity indicators) (Xu, 2013) .",

Contentbased news selection is driven by user motivations and goals (Edgerly et al., 2014) .

This has given rise to form-based news selection that emphasizes news display features, such as headline typeface size and accompanying illustrations. Also, collaborative filtering recommendations, including implicit (e.g. times read) and explicit (e.g. ratings) indicators, have been introduced to affect news selection (Knobloch-Westerwick, Sharma, Hansen and Alter, 2005) . Selection is a process consisting of three levels: selective attention determines to which stimuli in the environment our perceptual system is addressed; selective perception determines how information adapted to our cognitive system will be processed and stored; and selective retention determines which of the prior stored information our cognitive system will recollect (Donsbach, 2004) . Form-based news selection has been investigated at the first two levels. Bucher and Schumacher (2006) compared the attention patterns in the reception of print and online news in an eye-tracking study. They found that visual cues and information hierarchies guided the attention process as stimuli for an active, intentiondriven selection process. Go et al. (2014) explored the effects of interface cues on users' perceptions of online news. Their findings indicated that news from an expert source had higher perceived quality and that news from an expert source and recommended by more people had higher perceived credibility.",

That is, a person becomes aware of a sign, interpret it, and respond to it in sequence (Morris, 1964) . Since semiotics can be used to generate and convey meaning and thus influence people's response, it has wide application in the real world, especially in marketing. Recent related studies have explored the interplay of verbal and visual elements in semiotics and found that their congruence or coordination would enhance the effectiveness of communication (Adegoju and Ademilokun, 2015; Yu and Song, 2017) . The prevalence of visual resources on the internet has given rise to visual semiotics which has been found to positively affect users' attitudes, intention, and/or behavior (Wanick et al., 2018; Valentini et al., 2018) .",

In a clickbait detection study, Chakraborty et al. (2016) found that clickbait headlines were longer than conventional non-clickbait headlines, taking the form of well-formed English sentences with both content and function words. A focused study on question headlines indicated that question headlines were significantly more effective than declarative ones, particularly those with self-referencing cues (Lai and Farbrot, 2014) . However, Kuiken et al. (2017) found that the absence of a question would lead to better headline performance measured in terms of click-through rate and the use of numbers and headline length had no significant influence on performance.",

On Amazon, each customer review has a title, and title length was negatively related to readership (Salehan and Dan, 2016 ). An interesting finding for psychology articles is that amusing titles were usually shorter, and shorter titles had more citations (Subotic and Mukherjee, 2014) . There also exist various forms of short text without a title on the Web. It has been revealed that tweets shorter than 100 characters had a higher engagement rate, and ultra-short 40-character Facebook posts received much more likes and comments (Lee, 2014) .",

Further evidence has suggested that faster updates on social media would lead to higher source credibility as mediated by cognitive elaboration (Westerman et al., 2014) .

Clickstream data is a typical type of trace data generated on Web servers when users visit websites or applications for their own purposes. It captures all the clicks or page requests made by users in sequence, from entering to leaving a site. Each clickstream record basically informs us which user performs which type of action on which page at what time (Sen et al., 2006) . Clickstream data analysis was first employed by E-commerce researchers to perform customer clustering and to characterize and model customers' visiting and purchasing behavior.

When a user visits a site, each click causes a movement, the changing of location from one page to another, and leaves a footprint, a mark showing the user's presence on a page. The click series during that visit, i.e., chaining all the movements in a chronological order, engenders a pathway, indicating the process in which the user interacts with the site. In particular, the footprint left on a destination page where intended information is provided or intended task is enabled is a \"core footprint,\" and the movement that leads the user to the destination page is a \"pivotal movement.\" The footprint level analysis aims to provide a basic understanding of traffic distribution within a site or subsite. The movement level analysis concerns whether and how users' goals are achieved. The pathway-level analysis focuses on characterizing and visualizing individual users' or their aggregated paths of site navigation. This framework has been successfully applied in the studies of users' information-seeking behavior in social library systems ( Jiang, 2014) and academic library OPAC systems ( Jiang et al., 2017) .",

As a result of data cleaning and parsing, approximately 10 percent (n \u00bc 3,987,030) of the records remained, which involved 839,685 sessions belonging to 284,685 distinct users.",

Whether a headline contained numbers had no impact on users' clicking, despite the role of numbers in increasing credibility, as mentioned above. This may be explained by the fact that most numbers appeared as years which were not deemed an informative element. As for punctuation marks, only the inclusion of square brackets or round brackets was associated with more clicks. The former (\" \u3010\u3011 \") are boldfaced symbols that are much thicker and heavier than the surrounding text; and the latter (\" () \") are made up of two curves which easily stand out from straight-line Chinese characters.

Nevertheless, the researchers have a concern about the potential risks of misusing news headline presentation techniques. Clickbaits have been created by constructing extremely long headlines (Chakraborty et al., 2016) or overusing certain punctuation marks (Noguti, 2016) . Some news providers have even made use of computerwritten news articles to keep a high updating frequency to allure users into addictive news reading (Van der Kaa and Krahmer, 2014) . Visual prominence might be added to selected news deliberately with superiority in position and/or format. Responsible news providers should strive every effort to achieve authenticity and objectivity, both of which contribute to news trustworthiness (Gunter et al., 2009) . Therefore, it is unwise to mix normal news with clickbaits, advertisements, or duplicates, which will soon cause users' disgust and expel them instead. The \"bandwagon effect\" needs to be controlled appropriately as it may lock users in information cocoons (Zuiderveen et al., 2016) . If popular news contains bias, the negative effects of the bias can be strengthened as the news gets more popular. This is detrimental to the diversification of knowledge, opinions and interests.",

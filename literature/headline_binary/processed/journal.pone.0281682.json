As readers increasingly obtain their news over social media [1, 2] , publishers must engage their readers with individual articles rather than complete newspapers, in what has been dubbed the \"unbundling of journalism\" [3, 4] . Since the same phenomenon gives readers the freedom to obtain news from many sources, publishers are engaged in fierce competition for their readers' attention [4] . Moreover, the nature of online distribution has allowed news organizations to measure engagement at an unprecedented level of granularity and to experiment with distribution methods at a low cost [4] [5] [6] [7] . For news publishers, these technological changes have emphasized the importance of crafting an engaging first impression, and have provided the technical infrastructure to conduct rigorous optimization tools for doing so. Publishers, however, ultimately have a limited ability to guarantee the success of their own output and must focus on ensuring that their content is of high quality. For news headlines, this implies developing knowledge of the linguistic predictors of textual success.",

On our present focus of news, Berger & Milkman [8] studied the characteristics of New York Times articles that were heavily shared, identifying that articles that express positive or high-arousal emotions have a higher likelihood of becoming popular. A broad literature focuses on predicting success in news by various means [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , although much of this literature prioritizes prediction accuracy above the interpretation of features. The linguistic predictors of success have, however, been studied in other domains. For example, in online social media, Tan et al. [16] discovered several linguistic characteristics of tweets that outperformed closely matched alternatives in an observational study. Other studies on Twitter have investigated how sentiment [17] , emotion [18] , and length [19, 20] affect tweet success. Aside from social media, other studies have used linguistic features to predict success in online communities [21] , scientific abstracts [22] , literature [23] , and quotes [24] .",

                "text": "Despite this existing literature, the relationship between linguistic traits and success remains unclear due to fundamental limitations. Broadly, prior work on success employs observational data, where the success outcome can be deeply confounded. Omitted-variable bias can drastically affect the modeled relationship between linguistic covariates and the success outcome to be predicted. For a domain such as news, a number of factors that are often correlated with success can be difficult to control for in observational studies. The time at which content is published can affect success due to concurrent events that create a demand for news or changes in audience size, so any comparison between items that occur at materially different points in time is generally invalid. The author of the content affects success both as a correlate of quality and as a source of social influence. Author skill (though difficult to observe) ought to affect quality, which itself brings success. More importantly, the \"superstar phenomenon\" [25] demonstrates that the audience for different authors can vary by orders of magnitude, while social influence can affect how an author's content is received, independent of its quality [26] . In a study of Twitter popularity, it was shown that a model including only properties of the tweet author accounted for about half of the optimal model's predictive performance, while the other half was accounted for by the user's past success [27] . Moreover, the content of the article is dependent on the topic it discusses, and different topics have differing audience sizes. The format in which the article is presented also affects its success. In online news, articles on a homepage are typically presented in a grid with a thumbnail image associated with the article. The appeal of the image may drive clicks more than the linguistic properties of the headline. The digital era has enabled some researchers to mine big data for natural experiments that convincingly account for some of these important confounds [16] . It is, however, difficult to fully control for these critically important confounds, which can fundamentally alter the conclusions of any observational study regarding the content-specific predictors of success.",

We focus on news headlines, which we argue can serve as a \"model organism\" in an endeavor to elicit the linguistic factors of textual success, as news headlines are specifically crafted to engage with readers at a psychological level. We study a large number of experiments that were conducted by Upworthy, a popular online news publisher, which provides a large sample to test tightly controlled covariates. Each data point of our analysis is a randomized controlled experiment, so all exogenous factors that affect success are strictly controlled for. The experiments cover a long span of time, such that any linguistic covariates of time will be averaged within the multi-year period. Since each experiment varies headline options for a fixed article, and contextual factors such as the thumbnail of the article and the rest of the homepage are also fixed, we can control for the endogenous confounds of author, content, and context. Finally, the scale of the website on which the experiments were conducted ensures that each experiment is conducted on a large sample and linguistic comparisons are performed with strict measures of statistical significance.",

Visitors to the homepage of the Upworthy.com website were shown a selection of articles to view, and for the article that was the subject of any particular experiment, visitors were randomly assigned to see one variant of the headline. Every time the headline variant was shown to a visitor, as well as each time a visitor clicked on that headline variant, the event was logged.

Success can be the consequence of many complex factors at play, many of which are not observable or subject to unpredictable external shocks [35, 36] . It has been shown that even a fully-described complex system can be so prone to the accumulated effects of random behavior that reasonable predictability is impossible [26, 27, 37] . It is therefore not a priori clear that the success of content in complex sociotechnical systems can be predicted at all. However, the experimental nature of the Upworthy Research Archive data allows us to precisely control for time and topic, which accounts for complex social factors. Therefore, any differences in headline success should be almost entirely accounted for by the individual decisions of consumers, and by ensuring that paired comparisons have a sufficiently large sample size, the unobservable factors that affect individual-level decisions are averaged out. Our first analysis thus explicitly asks: Is there any systematic variation in the success of headlines that can be explained or predicted based on linguistic features? H1: The more successful headline in a controlled pair can be predicted at a statistically significant level based on linguistic features.",

A Gricean maxim of cooperative communication emphasizes that the quantity of transmitted information should be sufficient to be informative, but only as much as required [46] . Meanwhile, the maxim of relation may favor brevity, introducing a tension between being informative and being concise [47, 48] . There are reasons why shorter headlines may be expected to perform better. Shorter posts were found to be more successful on Twitter, with length constraints improving tweet quality [19] , and by shortening original tweets to various lengths, Gligori\u0107 et al. [20] found that tweets which are up to 30-40% shorter than their longer original versions are more likely to be judged as successful. Accordingly, in a study of phrases of text being repeated in various online sources, Simmons et al. [49] found that shorter phrases were used more often. On the other hand, a longer headline may contain more information, with a higher probability of engaging the reader [16] , a hypothesis that was indeed supported by our analysis of pilot data:",

However, the linguistic style of text posted on Twitter is substantially different from text present in other corpora of other online content such as online blogs [50] or the news headlines studied here. In particular, Hu et al. [40] described how stylistic features correlated with readability vary significantly across media. In a study of successful literary works, Ashok et al. [23] found that readability was negatively associated with success. A proposed explanation is that great literature demonstrates high conceptual complexity, which in turn demands lower readability.

A common issue in statistical learning is overfitting, in which an estimator exploits associations between predictors and the outcome that are idiosyncratic to the training data. Since there is a high probability of random associations occurring, an overfitted estimator will have high accuracy within the training sample. However, the goal of most statistical learning applications is generalization, or finding rules that yield good predictive performance on unseen data. Techniques such as cross-validation are designed to estimate generalization accuracy [54] , but the most reliable assessment uses a large portion of the dataset that was never used in the training process.

Consistent with the conclusion of a positive effect according to the pre-registered significance level \u03b1 = 0.01, the p-values range between p = 1.60x10-12 (corresponding to the variation when the word \"wrong\" is excluded) and p = 5.44x10-17 (when the word \"fight\" is excluded).",

We argue that, even though multiple variables are manipulated simultaneously, we are able to estimate the effects in a regression framework. In order to assess the potential for remaining confounding, we performed correlational analyses (Fig 5 ) on our design matrix of predictors. Since the correlations are small (ranging between -0.13 and +0.12) and the features are expressed on the same scale, by entering the eleven linguistic variables in a well-specified regression model, we argue that we can interpret effect sizes as causal effects. The advantage of the fact that the headlines are not directly manipulated by the website on a single linguistic variable is that the headlines are naturally written in their entirety as they are. Direct manipulation by insertion or deletion of words would provide a tight control, but might result in unnatural headlines. Future work should determine whether the results presented here hold when linguistic variables are directly manipulated. Furthermore, future work should examine the ways how linguistic features interact, potentially by analyzing larger numbers of tested headline variants.",

For example, regarding measuring emotions, advanced machine learning approaches to classify the emotion in the headlines exist. Similarly, the combined use of more sophisticated text representation tools, including other dictionary-based approaches and machine learning methods, could be used in future research to increase the predictability of success. However, we opt for using the LIWC dictionary approach due to its simplicity, interpretability, and frequent use in the previous literature. Additionally, the dictionary approach lets us identify the words that carry positive or negative emotion, which is compatible with our dictionary-based approaches of measuring other linguistic features of interest. Similarly, the usage of definite and indefinite articles is an imperfect proxy for generality and specificity of a headline, and headline length may not accurately reflect the quantity of information present in the headline. More detailed analyses are necessary to disentangle headline length, the amount of information that the headline contains, and its conciseness.",

Therefore, due to the large user base that it attracted, understanding the features of content that lead to clicks is important, regardless of the demographics. While the results may speak to a biased subset of the overall population, the demographic features of users cannot impact the estimated linguistic effects due to random assignment of headlines. Lastly, during the data-collection period (January 2013-April 2015), socially notable events took place, captured public attention, and were covered in the news.

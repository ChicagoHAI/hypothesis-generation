For example, one of the original patents for iPod, assigned to Apple Computer, Inc with Steve Jobs listed as one of the inventors [US20030095096A1], has a class-subclass pair 345/156, denoting class 345 (Computer Graphics Processing and Selective Visual Display Systems) and subclass 156 (Display Peripheral Interface Input Device). Examining all US patents dating from 1790 to 2010, researchers found that, during the nineteenth century, nearly half of all patents issued in the US were for single-code inventionsthose that utilize a single technology, rather than combining multiple technology areas. Today, by contrast, 90 percent of inventions combine at least two codes, showing that invention is increasingly a combinatorial process.",

Indeed, scientific papers draw their references from multiple journals, signaling the domains from which they sourced their ideas [92, 311, 312] . Some of these combinations are anticipated, whereas others are novel, deviating from conventional wisdom. If a paper cites a pair of journals that are rarely brought together, it may suggest that the paper introduces a novel combination of prior work. Take for instance a 2001 paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, which pinpointed the protein with which a known antipsychotic drug interacts and used this insight to identify other biological effects [313] . Its reference list is the first ever to cite both the journal Gene Expression and the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry [314], representing a novel combination of prior knowledge. On the other hand, other journals cited in the same paper, like the Journal of Biological Chemistry and Biochemical Journal, are frequently cocited in the literature, an example of the conventional pairings that reflect more mainstream thinking in the field.",

For instance, in the field of biochemistry, studying chemical relationships between unexplored compound pairs is much more novel than focusing on wellstudied chemicals, and such strategies are indeed more likely to achieve high impact. But the risk of failure of exploring such previously unexplored combinations is so high that, as an analysis estimated, the additional reward may not justify the risk [319] . The high variance in the impact of novel ideas may be rooted in the human bias against novelty. Studies of grant applications show that scientists tend to be biased against novel concepts before the work is realized. At a leading US medical school, researchers randomly assigned 142 world-class scientists to review 15 grant proposals. In parallel, the researchers measured the occurrences of rare combinations of keywords in each proposal [321] . For example, proposals combining the terms \"Type 1 diabetes\" and \"Insulin\" were typical, whereas proposals with \"Type 1 diabetes\" and \"Zebrafish\" presented a novel combination rarely seen in the literature. But would the more novel proposals be graded more or less favorably? The researchers found that proposals that scored high on novelty received systematically lower ratings than their less novel counterparts. Even nominally \"interdisciplinary\" grants are not immune to similar biases [322] . Analyzing all 18,476 proposals submitted to an Australian funding program, including both successful and unsuccessful applications, researchers measured how many different fields were represented in each proposal, which is weighted by how distant those fields were. The results indicated that the more interdisciplinary the proposed work, the lower the likelihood of being funded.",

In doing so, he exhibited an essential feature of many high-fitness ideas that do achieve great impact: They tend to be grounded in conventional combinations of prior work, while also merging hitherto un-combined, atypical knowledge. Analyzing 17.9 million papers spanning all scientific fields, researchers found that papers that introduced novel combinations, yet remained embedded in conventional work, were at least twice as likely to be hits than the average paper [92] .

They found that overall, articles covered by the Times received 72.8 percent more citations in the first year than the non-covered group. But can we attribute this dramatic impact difference to the publicity that the Times offers? Or could it be that the Times simply covered outstanding papers, which would have gathered just as many citations without their coverage? A natural experiment allowed the researchers to find a more definitive answer: The Times staff underwent a 12-week strike from August 10 to November 5, 1978. During this period, it continued to print a reduced \"edition of record\" but did not sell copies to the public. In other words, it continued to earmark articles it deemed worthy of coverage during the strike, but this information never reached its readership. During this period, researchers found, the citation advantage disappeared entirelythe articles that the Times selected for coverage did no better than those it didn't in terms of citations. Therefore, the citation advantage of attention-grabbing papers cannot be explained solely by their higher quality, novelty, or even mass appealit is also the result of media coverage itself.",

But perhaps the most basic reason is that media publicity is, more often than not, good publicity. Indeed, a TV station or newspaper does not pretend to be a check or balance on science.

Research on media coverage of medical studies found that journalists prefer to cover only initial findings, many of which are refuted by subsequent studies and metaanalyses. But journalists often fail to inform the public when the studies they covered are disproven [325, 326] . When a team of researchers examined 5,029 articles about risk factors for diseases and how those articles were covered in the media [326] , they found that studies reporting positive associations about disease risk and protection (e.g., studies suggesting that a certain food may cause cancer, or that a certain behavior may help stave off heart disease) tend to be widely covered. In contrast, studies finding no significant association received basically zero media interest. Moreover, when follow-up analyses fail to replicate widely reported positive associations, these follow-up results are rarely mentioned in the media. This is troubling since the researchers found that, of the 156 studies reported by newspapers that initially described positive associations, only 48.7 percent were supported by subsequent studies. This hints at the main tension between the media and the sciences: While the media tends to cover the latest advances, in science, it's the complete body of scientific work that matters. A single study can almost never definitively prove or disprove an effect, nor confirm or discredit an explanation [327, 328] . Indeed, the more novel a paper's initial findings, the more vulnerable they are to refutation [8] .",

Presently, many parents in the United States refuse to vaccinate their children against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), fearing that the vaccine could cause autism. Why do they believe that? This fear is rooted in a 1998 paper published by Andrew Wakefield in The Lancet, which received worldwide media coverage [329] . However, the original study was based on only 12 children, and follow-up studies unanimously failed to confirm the link. Furthermore, researchers later found that Wakefield had distorted his data, hence the paper was retracted. He subsequently lost his license and was barred from practicing medicine (see https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Andrew_Wakefield). Yet, although Wakefield's findings have been widely refuted and discredited in the scientific community, the media's coverage of Wakefield's claim led to a decline in vaccination rates in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. system. Here, it seems, we finally have a form of bad publicity. But do these critiques and rebuttals diminish a paper's impact? And, if so, how much? Comments, which tend to question the validity of a paper, are often seen as \"negative citations,\" ostensibly making the original paper less trustworthy in the eye of the scientific community. Hence, one would expect commented papers to have less impact. Yet studies have revealed the opposite: Commented papers are not only cited more than non-commented papersthey are also significantly more likely to be among the most cited papers in a journal [283] .",

The measure of this impact is the citation count of each paper, that is, the number of citations from other papers to that paper. Predicting citation count enables us to screen papers to determine papers that potentially have high impact. Citation count is a reasonable feature for formalizing scientific impact. The impact factor [10] , which is often referred as a quality measure of journal titles, is defined for a journal using the citation counts of the articles published in that journal. The h-index [11] , which is a measure of the contribution of a researcher to the society concerned, is also based on the citation counts of papers written by that researcher. Citation count will increase as time elapses, and hence is not appropriate for measuring the impact of brand-new papers. Therefore, we need to predict the potential citation count of a paper using features that can be directly extracted from it.",

A variety of features can be used for solving the problem of citation count prediction [14] . Previous literature on this problem claims that the textual data of a paper do not deeply affect the prediction compared with data about authors and venue of publication (see Section 5) . However, textual data, especially abstracts, are worth analysing in detail for the following reason. Textual data should be directly related to the contents of a paper. In particular, abstracts are usually available as the metadata of respective papers. The other metadata, including authors, authors' institutions, and journal (or conference) titles can be features of multiple papers, while an abstract corresponds to the paper concerned.

We investigated several types of classification of research paper abstracts to predict citation count. Our aim is to clarify the effects of (1) the abstracts of papers and (2) the technical and non-technical terms used in abstracts rather than to achieve high accuracy. We applied a standard classification method based on the bag-of-words model [13] to a set of abstracts of papers with high and low citation counts and investigated the accuracy and distinctive phrases. We obtained abstracts with citation counts from a database of research papers. Then, we defined the set of high and low citation counts by selecting top \u03b8% and bottom \u03b8% papers in order of citation count in the obtained abstracts. We also applied the same classification method to another set of modified abstracts in which the technical terms were replaced with a meaningless symbol. Additionally, we conducted a classification using only the technical terms that appear in the abstracts for comparison. Our previous work [4] reported that citation counts can be predicted using only the non-technical terms used in abstracts. This paper performs a strict detection of technical terms. The non-technical terms used in the previous work include some technical terms; hence, the result can be affected by the technical terms. Additionally, this paper compares our prediction method with other methods that use the contiguous occurrences of words and those that use only technical terms to clarify the effects of technical terms on prediction accuracy.",

Additionally, the textual data are treated as topics extracted from raw text in existing work. Therefore, non-topic information included in the textual data, such as the writing style, has not been considered as a feature for prediction. Yan et al. [14] treated textual data as topics and concluded that their effect on prediction is small. They formalized the problem of citation count prediction. They applied four kinds of regression to three types of features of each paper (content, author, and venue). The content feature category includes the topics, which were obtained using latent Dirichlet allocation [6] from the textual data of the papers. The categories of author and venue include attributes related to the authors of each paper and the conference or journal at which each paper was published, respectively. The results of their experiments indicate that the features in the content category have little effect on prediction accuracy.",

We classified the abstracts of papers with high and low citation counts using word occurrences, and compared the result with the cases in which we hid technical terms or we used only technical terms. Using abstracts affected the accuracy of binary classification of papers into those with high and low citations. The decrease in accuracy by hiding technical terms was larger than the decrease caused by using only technical terms. Therefore, we conclude that the citation counts of papers are highly related to the technical terms that appear in their abstracts.",

We used the simple SVM with a linear kernel which straightforwardly define distinctive phrases of each class on the basis of the weights used in the classifier. We can apply other machine learning methods to the classification to improve the accuracy, but we need to explain the mechanism of classification as the finding of distinctive phrases. Another direction is extending the analysis of distinctive phrases. We listed several phrases with large or small weights in the classifier, but the vocabulary size, that is, the dimensionality of the vector space for each classification was extremely large. Therefore, we need a method to investigate a large number of phrases efficiently. Additionally, we are planning to apply our results to actual problems. The results of the experiments is expected to be used for an automatic proofreading of research papers; the scores put on phrases can suggest a better phrase expected to lead high impact. ",

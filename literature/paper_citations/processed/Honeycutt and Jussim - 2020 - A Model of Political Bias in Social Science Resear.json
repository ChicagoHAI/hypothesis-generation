    "abstract": "In 2019 at the SPSP Political Psychology Pre-Conference, key stakeholders and researchers were invited to debate the question \"does ideological diversity impact the quality of our research?\" If Clark and Winegard's (this issue) review of ideological epistemology and its significance to social science is mostly on target, it would predict that many at the debate were unconvinced by those arguing that political bias matters. Why? To the extent that social psychologists function as a moral tribal community (as Clark and Winegard argue), motivated to protect their professional and political interests, they will fight tooth and nail to defend their sacred values and professional statuses against charges of political bias. Of course, they might also do so out of a justified belief that they were unfairly accused. How can one tell the difference? In this paper we argue that this can be accomplished by identifying how political biases manifest in social psychology. To that end, we expand upon two of Clark and Winegard's (this issue) arguments: 1. there are no reasons to believe that social scientists are immune to the biases, errors, and social processes that can lead to distortions that stem from tribal loyalties; 2. these tribal tendencies, combined with extreme ideological homogeneity, work to create significant problems for the pursuit of scientific truth. Specifically, we present a heuristic model of political bias that identifies ways they manifest, and we review evidence that bears on it.\nClark and Winegard (this issue) reviewed some of the ways in which political biases undermine the validity and credibility of social science research. Their review concludes that political bias manifests as theories the field has advanced that flatter liberals and disparage conservatives, as ideologically motivated skepticism against theories and data that challenge liberal positions, and an overrepresentation of liberals in social psychology. Political bias has also emerged in the review of ideologically charged scientific articles, in exaggerating the impact of effects favorable to liberal positions, in ignoring plausible alternative hypotheses, in how some findings are framed and described, and in how findings are discussed.

They further argue that the most sacred value for many social scientists is equalitarianism, by which they refer to a complex of interrelated ideas: (1) There are no biological differences between groups on socially valued traits (and, especially, no genetic differences); (2) Prejudice and discrimination are the only sources of group differences (and anyone who says otherwise is a bigot); and (3) Society has a moral obligation to arrange itself so that all groups are equal on socially valued outcomes.",

Equalitarianism can, in our view, trigger scientific biases even when claims do not involve biology. For example, arguing that cultural or religious differences between groups produces unequal outcomes can also trigger equalitarian defensiveness, accusations of bigotry, and biased science. When Amy Wax argued that differences in the adoption of \"bourgeois values\" explains many of the outcome differences between blacks and whites in the U.S. (Wax & Alexander, 2017) , the outraged response was immediate and swift (Haidt, 2017) . Why? After decades of being inculcated with the evils of \"blaming the victim\" (Ryan, 1971) , any explanation for group differences, whether or not biological, other than discrimination is enough to trigger equalitarian outrage among some scientists. Our point is not that Wax was correct; it is that she made no biological arguments at all. This is a real-world case in which something other than an attribution to discrimination for group differences on socially valued traits produced the full-blown outrage predicted by Clark and Winegard's perspective. The second author of the present paper also notes that simply presenting evidence of the accuracy of stereotypes (without any presumption or evidence bearing on why groups differ) has also produced similar reactions (Lehmann, 2015) .",

In the extreme, this may go beyond a demand for absolute equality among groups and overflow into a motivation to \"turn the tables\" (to compensate for past wrongs by placing formerly marginalized groups not on an equal footing, but on a superior one; e.g. Weinstein, 2018) . For example, samples that skew politically left have recently been found to consider companies insufficiently racially diverse unless they have at least 25-32% black representation (Danbold & Unzueta, 2019) . Because blacks only make up about 13% of the U.S. population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018) this is plausibly viewed as a turn the tables implicit endorsement of discrimination against other groups.",

Nonetheless, women now represent a majority of social psychologists, most of the leadership in at least one of the main social psychology professional organizations (SPSP, 2019) , a majority of psychologists (American Psychological Association, 2015 Association, , 2018)) , and have been more likely to complete high school, college, and graduate degrees than have men for about 40 years (Sharp, 2010) . If absolute equality was the only driver of motivated bias, one would be witnessing a dramatic upsurge in claims emphasizing biases against and obstacles to the success and representation of boys and men, given that inequality in these areas now favors women. That so much of the social science effort focuses on biases against women, and so little on those against men, even after women have largely turned the tables in these areas, is plausibly interpretable as indicating that, for some scholars, it is not equality per se that is held sacred.",

For example, the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP; the largest professional organization for social and personality psychologists) released a report on diversity and the climate within their organization (SPSP Diversity and Climate Committee, 2019). Conservatives constituted 4% of the SPSP membership, whereas they constitute 35% of the U.S. population (Gallup, 2018) . By comparison, African Americans constitute only 4.1% of the membership of SPSP whereas they constitute 13.4% of the U.S. population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018; the membership of SPSP is 84% U.S., so this benchmark seems reasonable). Thus, African Americans are underrepresented by about 70% and conservatives are underrepresented by almost 90%.

The core idea is that mentorship is important (Reinero, 2019) ; if students don't find successful role models like themselves, they are less likely to pursue a career in that discipline. For example, referring to women in STEM, Dasgupta and Stout (2014, p. 24) argue that \"Young adults identify with successful female role models whose presence allows them to think: 'If she can be successful, so can I' and 'I want to be like her.'\" Given the support for the gender similarity hypothesis (Hyde, 2005) , we know of no reason to believe that this sort of social psychological process is unique to women, and there are many to think that they probably apply widely (Honeycutt, Jussim, & Freberg, 2019; Reinero, 2019, includ- ing to political role models in the social sciences (Honeycutt & Freberg, 2017) . If non-liberal students do not have faculty who share their beliefs and values, this may dissuade some from furthering their studies, and from pursuing academic careers (Redding, 2012) . It follows, then, that the social sciences may be stuck in a self-perpetuating trap whereby political bias driven by ideological homogeneity has created an obstacle to non-liberal students becoming a part of the field. This process may create further ideological homogeneity in a self-exacerbating cycle.",

For heterosexual and sexual minority members, reported experiences of subtle exclusion were 13.8% and 20.1%, respectively. The SPSP report also concluded that conservatives felt \"their social identities were less valued than either liberals or participants who reported being neither liberal nor conservative\" (p. 63). Although the sample size for conservatives was small (and, therefore, should be interpreted with caution), the pattern of responses across items all point in the same direction and data from the wide variety of studies reviewed above strongly suggests that conservatives experience more hostility in academia than do liberals.",

According to one recent review, both theory and empirical evidence indicate that cognitive, motivational, and social factors can and do influence the questions researchers ask in ways that are vulnerable to political biases (Jussim, Stevens, & Honeycutt, 2018) . For example, political homogeneity may lead to premature scientific foreclosure-the erroneous belief that science has settled some question, thereby discouraging further work on the topic that might reveal the error. For example, social psychology prematurely foreclosed on conclusions emphasizing the power of self-fulfilling prophecies (Jussim, 2012) , the greater susceptibility to bias among conservatives than liberals (Ditto et al., 2018) , the existence of higher levels of prejudice among conservatives than liberals (Brandt, Reyna, Chambers, Crawford, & Wetherell, 2014) , and the power and pervasiveness of \"unconscious prejudice\" (Jussim, Careem, Goldberg, Honeycutt, & Stevens, in press ). In each case, a \"consensus\" in support of the erroneous perspective could be found in the scientific literature that lasted decades.

Researchers from two camps were invited to debate whether conservatives and liberals are biased in similar ways (symmetry), or whether conservatives are more biased than liberals (asymmetry). The debate certainly reflected progress, given that for decades the field had prematurely foreclosed on the conclusion that conservatives were more biased than liberals (e.g. Brandt, Reyna, Chambers, Crawford, & Wetherell, 2014; Ditto et al., 2018) . However, and here is an informal test of readers' own political biases: Do you see anything missing? (Take a minute before reading on \u2026 ). We do. There was a possibility that was not even considered: Are people on the left more biased than those on the right? Given the awful history of leftwing atrocities (Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, Eastern Europe under Communism, North Korea, et cetera), many of which were enabled by all sorts of biases in reasoning and toxic social norms (Solzhenitsyn, 1973) , the failure to even raise this question for consideration was a clear blind spot.",

Issues related to social desirability have encouraged the rise of proxy measures in social science research; participants might not be willing to admit if they are racist or sexist, so indirect measures are needed to get around this. Symbolic racism (Sears, 1988) , for example, was created to get around social desirability in the assessment of racism. Critics, however, have identified a slew of reasons that this indirect measure of racism was actually, at least in part, a measure of political conservatism and belief in meritocracy (Tetlock & Mitchell, 1993) . The tangling of conservative and racial concepts in a measure intended to indirectly assess racism makes it impossible to assess the independent and interactive effects of either construct (Tetlock, 1994) . If, in turn, canonical conclusions regarding prejudice become rooted in the use of indirect measures that are infused with political bias, our understanding of both prejudice and ideology may become deeply flawed (Reyna, 2018) .",

Nearly two decades after introducing items for an actively open-minded thinking scale (AOT), Stanovich and Toplak (2019) discovered they had inadvertently introduced bias against religious individuals into their measure through items asking participants about \"beliefs.\" It was assumed by Stanovich and his colleagues that participants all interpreted \"belief\" in the same way, but they came to recognize that \" \u2026 our own political/worldview conceptions leaked into these items in subtle ways\" (p. 163). Specifically, they presumed \"beliefs\" referred to secular, empirically verifiable understandings of the world. For secular academic intellectuals, this presumption is understandable. However, when they discovered unexpectedly high negative correlations of religiousness with some variations of the AOT scale, they revisited the items and reanalyzed some existing data. Those analyses were consistent with a conclusion that religious respondents interpreted \"beliefs\" as \"spiritual beliefs.\" As a result, this led religious people to appear far less openminded with respect to secular beliefs (which was the focus of the AOT) than they actually were.",

For measurement, this is an important question to keep in mind. Being vigilant in the choice and construction of methods used, in addition to ensuring the validity of measures, would assist in mitigating the effect of political bias on measurement. As summarized by Reyna (2018) , researchers must ensure their questions are not onesided, that political assumptions are not embedded to the detriment of construct and face validity, and reviewers and consumers must carefully scrutinize measures to ensure that they assess what they are purported to assess (see also Flake & Fried, 2019 , for a review of questionable measurement practices).",

Although such a pattern by itself may or may not reflect bias, other work more clearly identifies how political biases manifest as framing findings in ways that derogate conservatives. For example, Lilienfeld (2015) pointed out that the robust finding that conservatives are more sensitive to threat than are liberals has been framed as \"negativity bias\" or \"motivated closed-mindedness\" (they could just as readily been framed as liberal \"positivity bias\" or \"motivated blindness to danger\").",

                "text": "Political bias can also influence the interpretation of findings through the exaggeration of differences between conservatives and liberals in ways that flatter liberals. Such is the case when researchers commit the high-low fallacy (Reyna, 2018) . Often, researchers fall victim to interpreting small differences at one end of the scale as if the differences reflect values at the scale endpoints. For example, even though relatively few people score on the authoritarian end of the rightwing authoritarianism scale (RWA), psychologists routinely refer to conservatives as high and liberals as low in authoritarianism (Reyna, 2018) . Statistically significant differences do not indicate that groups are at opposite ends of the scale (Reyna, 2018) . Instead, more valid interpretations would be that liberals score low on RWA whereas conservatives' scores are more intermediate. Of course, this problem is itself confounded with the measurement problem-is anyone shocked that conservatives score higher than liberals on a rightwing authoritarianism scale, whereas liberals score higher than conservatives, on a leftwing authoritarianism scale (Conway, Houck, Gornick, & Repke, 2018) ? Such biases may be particularly powerful when, exactly as argued by Clark and Winegard, they are driven by equalitarian motives. This may help explain why identical effect sizes (of about r\u00bc.11) are viewed as socially important if being socially important advances social justice (by revealing that implicit bias causes \"important\" levels of discrimination; Greenwald, Banaji, & Nosek, 2015) , and trivially small if being trivially small advances social justice (debunking discriminatory stereotypes by revealing there are few serious differences between men and women Hyde, 2005) . However, as scientific generalizations, socially important is mutually exclusive with trivially small. How is it possible, then, that both descriptions exist unchallenged in highly-cited articles appearing in prominent peerreviewed journals, without even acknowledgment of the contradiction, let alone attempts to resolve it? Clark and Winegard provide a likely answer: both articles advance equalitarian social justice narratives, and scientists are motivated to embrace those narratives. Explicitly acknowledging that these two equalitarian narratives conflict with each other would undercut the ability to advance at least one of them. Accordingly, their perspective predicts that few will notice the contradiction and, even among those that do, even fewer will be motivated to point it out and risk the ire of their colleagues.",

However, this explanation is, at best, incomplete, inasmuch as statistically significant evidence of anti-white bias among black respondents was found and the studies still were not published. Second, regardless of the reasons for suppression, the mere fact that these findings were suppressed means that the scientific literature was biased in an equalitarian direction (overstating the extent of racial bias by its failure to include these 17 studies finding no bias among whites) until Zigerell's (2018) forensic work rediscovered these studies.

Putting aside the fact that six of the ten studies did not address racial discrimination, even the four that did found almost no evidence of racial discrimination (see Jussim et al., in press , for a review).

Indeed, there are more than ample documentable instances where academics have been subject to punishment (investigations, firings, retractions), not because their ideas were refuted or their data found to be fraudulent, but because other academics found their ideas offensive. Most of these cases involved findings or arguments that challenged (or, perhaps, threatened) academics' equalitarian sensibilities (race, sex, Quillette, 2019) .",

If so, the obvious consequence is that suppression of research ideas and findings out of fear of running afoul of one's colleagues will produce a biased \"scientific literature\" that provides more support for equalitarian narratives than is actually justified.",

                "text": "Political motivations and blinders may also distort scientific literatures by influencing which studies researchers emphasize. This can manifest in many ways, one of which is citations. Although papers can be cited for many reasons, some are that researchers consider them relevant, valuable, or important. However, it is also possible that many researchers selectively cite and emphasize work that they agree with. Like other biases, this may, but need not, manifest as only citing work one agrees with; bias would occur when work is cited more frequently based on its political content rather than its scientific quality. Because Clark and Winegard only scratch the surface of citation biases, we present more such evidence here. For example, in 2012 and 2015, papers reporting studies assessing gender biases in STEM hiring were published. Table 1 summarizes their key characteristics and citations and shows the paper finding biases against women has been cited at a vastly higher rate even though by most conventional methodological quality metrics (number of studies, sample size) it was less methodologically sound. This citation pattern shown in Table 1 is not unusual. Jussim (2019) examined citation patterns of ten papers published in 2015 or earlier on gender bias in peer review (Table 2 ). Four found biases favoring men; six found either no bias or biases favoring women. The citation patterns echoed those shown in Table 1 ; vastly larger-scale studies finding no evidence of biases against women are cited at a fraction of the rate of far smaller studies finding biases against women. This pattern is not restricted to gender issues. A famous study that primed age stereotypes and found people walk down the hall more slowly has been cited over 5,000 times Chen, & Burrows, 1996); a failed replication (Doyen, Klein, Pichon, & Cleeremans, 2012) , 580 (all citation counts in the present and next paragraphs were obtained on December 10, 2019 from Google Scholar). Even if we restrict citations to 2013 and later, the counts are 2,340 and 548. The first paper finding stereotype threat effects among women in math (Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999) has been cited over 3,800 times; a failed replication with a far larger sample size (Finnigan & Corker, 2016) , a mere 33. If we restrict citations to 2017 and later, the counts are, respectively, 941 and 30.",

These patterns, however, are not restricted to successful studies versus failed replications. Darley and Gross (1983) examined whether individuating information reduced stereotype biases (they found it increased bias). However, the first study framed as addressing exactly that issue was published previously, in the same journal, and found that individuating information eliminated stereotype bias (Locksley, Borgida, Brekke, & Hepburn, 1980) . Locksley et al. (1980) has been cited 666 times; that is pretty high, but well under half the rate of Darley and Gross's (1983) over 1,500 citations, and this is despite the fact that Locksley et al. (1980) reported two studies with a combined total of 325 participants, whereas Darley and Gross (1983) only reported a single study with 70 participants. Of course, if it is easy to reduce or eliminate stereotype biases in person perception by providing individuating information, this undercuts equalitarian narratives emphasizing the power of such biases. This, according to Clark and Winegard's analysis, likely explains some or all of the difference in citations.",

The social sciences currently have processes, but no consensus or norms, regarding the standards to be used to canonize a finding or conclusion. Descriptively, the process seems to involve claims making it into journals of record (e.g. Psychological Bulletin, Perspectives on Psychological Science, et cetera), Annual Review and Handbook chapters, major textbooks, and the (Jussim, 2019) like. But what determines whether findings make it into those outlets of record? It is currently an unclear combination of popularity, prestige, having the right allies and supporters, compellingness of narrative, and validity (Jussim, Crawford, Anglin, et al., 2016; Jussim, et al., 2019; Merton, 1973; Tomkins, Zhang, & Heavlin, 2017) . Except for validity, none of these factors constitute grounds for claiming a finding or conclusion is actually true. Table 3 captures this state of affairs. The ideal situation is when valid findings are canonized. If invalid findings are ignored, the canon is also better off, though, of course, we rarely know which findings are valid versus invalid until a skeptical scientific community has had years, sometimes decades, to fully vet the research. The other two cells are even more suboptimal: Canonization of invalid findings can lead to a Reign of Error (and psychology's replication crisis strongly suggests that is exactly what we have had in many areas for the last several decades), and failure to canonize valid findings harms the field by depriving it of valid knowledge.",

This refers to the mistaken belief that, just because something has been published correcting past scientific errors, the scientific record has been corrected. If the work correcting errors is ignored, no correction has taken place. It is possible, of course, that future research will vindicate the view that gender stereotypes are mostly inaccurate. Furthermore, any scientist is welcome to criticize any area of research and make the case that it is invalid. Nonetheless, reviews that claim comprehensiveness and nuance, such as those appearing in Annual Review of Psychology, should not be in the business of simply ignoring work that fails to fit equalitarian narratives.",

We note here that most are readily detectable as manifestations in the published literature without requiring attributions to individual researcher motivations. When scale labels condemn conservatives, or certain types of studies are systematically ignored or go unpublished, or certain types of questions go unasked, the scientific literature itself becomes politically biased, regardless of whether individual researchers harbor such biases. The existence of political bias in academic research can damage the reputation and credibility of individual researchers, whole fields, and academia itself. It increases skepticism among key consumers such as policymakers, judges, and the public (Cofnas, Carl, & Woodley of Menie, 2017; Duarte et al., 2015; Gauchat, 2012; Redding, 2001) . The patterns of bias described in this review may also at least partially explain why there has been such a strong decline in support for science among conservatives, who, with some justification, see science on politicized issues as itself hopelessly politicized (Cofnas et al., 2017; Gauchat, 2012) .",

The lack of conservatives in the social sciences, combined with explicit endorsement of discrimination against conservatives, gives lay conservatives ample reasons to doubt the validity of conclusions seeming to support liberal, equalitarian, social justice narratives. We urge readers to imagine a counterfactual: That the social sciences included a large minority of conservative scientists, that our methods were actually capable of providing clear scientific answers to controversial and politicized issues, and that most scientists valued truth over politics. In this hypothetical world, highquality methods could lead both liberal and conservative social scientists to converge on answers to some difficult questions. In this case, we speculate that research findings from this hypothetical world would have far higher credibility among the lay public for two reasons: 1. Representation of a broad ideological range of views among scientists signals a commitment to fairness, openness, and honesty; and 2. It guarantees that a large number of scientists (if consensus is reached) on everyone's \"side\" confirm the validity of the finding, regardless of whose political narrative it validates. This should make it far more difficult to dismiss scientific findings as partisan ax-grinding by other means. Furthermore, by virtue of experts on one's own side endorsing the research, the findings may be rendered far more palatable. Although we are not suggesting that vigorous embrace of intellectual and political diversity in the social sciences is some sort of scientific panacea, this hypothetical world-which contrasts sharply with our actual world-captures some of the potential benefits social science might reap by rectifying its political lack of diversity and taking its political bias problems seriously.",

To aid in this effort, Jussim & Crawford (2018) reviewed research identifying a slew of actions that scientists can take now to limit their vulnerability to such biases. Although space does not permit a deep exposition here, in brief, those included: increase one's own exposure to politically diverse views as espoused by those who hold them (rather than [mis]characterizations of those views by their opponents), include political views in diversity statements and programs, subject all work (including equalitarianism-validating work) to intense scientific skepticism, use strong inference (design studies to test competing alternative theoretical perspectives), wait to bring researchbased interventions into public applications until after the underlying research has undergone a long period of skeptical scientific vetting, and develop hypotheses and research programs based on theoretical predictions that are so strong they leave little room for political biases. We echo Clark & Winegard's hope that social scientists will become more aware of their biases. Through the type of critical introspection they called for, and by acting on some of these recommendations described, we also hope this will work toward curtailing its influence on social science research.",

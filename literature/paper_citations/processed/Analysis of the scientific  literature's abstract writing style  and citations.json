The purpose of this paper is to explore the correlation between citations of scientific articles and writing styles of abstracts in papers and capture the characteristics of highly cited papers' abstracts. Design/methodology/approach -This research selected 10,000 highly cited papers and 10,000 zero-cited papers from the WOS (2008WOS ( -2017) ) database. The Coh-Metrix 3.0 textual cohesion analysis tool was used to quantify the 108 language features of highly cited and zero-cited paper abstracts. The differences of the indicators with significant differences were analyzed from four aspects: vocabulary, sentence, syntax and readability. Findings -The abstracts of highly cited papers contain more complex and professional words, more adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions and personal pronouns, but fewer nouns and verbs. The sentences in the abstracts of highly cited papers are more complex and the sentence length is relatively longer. The syntactic structure in abstracts of highly cited papers is relatively more complex and syntactic similarities between sentences are fewer. Highly cited papers' abstracts are less readable than zero-cited papers' abstracts. Originality/value -This study analyses the differences between the abstracts of highly cited and those of zero-cited papers, reveals the common external and deep semantic features of highly cited papers in abstract writing styles, provide suggestions for researchers on abstract writing. These findings can help increase the scientific impact of articles and improve the review efficiency as well as the researchers' abstract writing skills.",

Convenient as it is, this approach brings certain drawbacks. Take the title data of the paper as an example. The average number of words in the title of the papers collected by WOS (Web of Science) is 9.53 words (Guo et al., 2018) . That is to say, the number of citations of papers can be judged only by the essays with less than 10 words, which obviously leaves out a lot of information.",

Researchers often read the abstract to grasp the main idea of a paper (Dowling et al., 2018) and decide whether they would like to continue reading or cite the paper. Therefore, we believe that there is a certain correlation between abstracts and citation numbers. In addition, compared with full-text data, abstracts are easier to obtain. At present, studies on the relationship between the abstract and the number of citations are rare, while the available literature is mainly based on features like the length (Didegah and Thelwall, 2013; Wesel et al., 2014; Sohrabi and Iraj, 2017; Xie et al., 2019) and readability (Gazni, 2011; Didegah and Thelwall, 2013; Wesel et al., 2014; Lei and Yan, 2016; Didegah et al., 2018; Fages, 2020) of abstracts. The research gap is that none of these studies have analyzed and extracted the syntactic structure, lexical complexity and deep semantic information of the abstract texts. We think to some extent the potential influencing factors might be omitted.",

The findings indicate that there is a certain degree of correlation between the title and the number of citations. The above studies have two issues to be resolved. The first issue is that titlebased research usually only analyses the external characteristics of the title, such as the length of the title, the sentence structure, the number of keywords included. However, it is rare to find study mined deeply into the intrinsic features of titles. The second issue is that the title is a very short text, which leads to the inevitable defect that it contains only a very small amount of useful information. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the number of citations only by the title.",

However, compared with the abstract and full text, the information contained is quite limited. Sohrabi and Iraj (2017) explored the abstract text further and found that the ratio of the occurrence of keywords in the abstract to the length of the abstract could be used to predict the number of citations. In addition to studying the correlation between the length of abstract and the number of citations (Didegah and Thelwall, 2013; Wesel et al., 2014; Didegah et al., 2018) , the readability of abstract has also been explored. Vergoulis et al. (2019) used four readability metrics and three scientific impact measures to calculate the readability and scientific impact of all abstracts in the Open Citations COCI dataset. The results show that the overall readability of scientific publications is declining, and the readability of abstracts is not significantly related to scientific impact. Lei and Yan (2016) selected four core journals in the field of information science, used FRE and SMOG readability indicators to explore the relationship between the number of citations and the readability of abstracts, also found that there was no significant correlation. Gazni (2011) explored the correlation between abstracts produced by five top institutions in the world and reading difficulty and found that abstracts of highly cited papers are often difficult to read. Didegah et al. (2018) analyzed abstracts of papers written by Finnish authors in WOS and found that the number of citations with easier abstracts to read was significantly reduced compared with those with more difficult abstracts. Didegah and Thelwall (2013) found that the readability of abstract was negatively correlated with the number of citations in Biology and Biochemistry. For Economics (Didegah et al., 2018; Fages, 2020) , the abstracts of papers that are easy to read have a positive correlation with the citations and popularity. In addition, Hafeez et al. (2019) found that in Psychiatry, the use of structured abstracts can enhance the academic impact of journals and papers. The abstract is the data type with the longest text length in the metadata of the paper. It can present the main frame and experimental flow of the paper comprehensively. By analyzing the abstract, more factors affecting the number of citations can be discovered. This is one of the considerations why we chose abstract text in WOS as the experimental data to explore the correlation between abstract and citations. We believe that the readability of the abstract should be related to the number of citations (Gazni, 2011; Didegah et al., 2018; Dowling et al., 2018) . The reason is that an easy-to-understand writing method is certainly more conducive to readers' understanding than an obscure writing method.",

We manually downloaded the records in the above time range from WOS and stored them in the SQL Server database. The downloaded WOS data included multiple document formats such as article, proceedings paper, retracted publication, editorial material, etc. To ensure that the articles are all research papers (Didegah and Thelwall, 2013) , we limited the document types to article and proceedings paper. The number of citations in different disciplines is not the same (Slyder et al., 2011; Marx and Bornmann, 2015; Tahamtan et al., 2016) , but because our research wants to explore the universal difference between abstracts with high citation and those with zero citation in the whole field of scientific research, so when selecting highly cited papers, we valued the number of citations more than the subject category. In addition, we have limited the publication type to journal and the language to English.

On the other hand, since the selected top 10,000 cited papers are based on the number of cited papers in all WOS databases from 2008 to 2017, it is understandable that those published earlier enjoy a better chance of being cited, hence a higher possibility of being ranked among the top 10,000 cited papers.",

We selected the same number of zero-cited papers according to the number of highly cited papers from each discipline in each year.

The latest version is Coh-Metrix 3.0. This tool is widely used for evaluation of writing quality (Zedelius et al., 2019; Macarthur et al., 2019) , writing ability (Perin and Lauterbach, 2018) and cognitive understanding (Wiley et al., 2017) . Some researchers have also proposed new text analysis methods based on Coh-Metrix tools (Wolfe et al., 2019) or developed new application platforms (Shi et al., 2018; McNamara et al., 2013) . In addition, relevant researchers have carried out some research on the measurement of text readability and complexity (Tortorelli, 2020; Spencer et al., 2019) , which also provides some valuable guidance and reference for the selection of method in this paper.

All three indexes indicate that the readability of abstracts with more citations in WOS is lower than that of papers with zero citation. This result suggests that abstracts of highly cited papers are not always easy to read. This finding also verifies the previous studies (Gazni, 2011; Didegah et al., 2018; Didegah and Thelwall, 2013) . The reason lies in the characteristics of the papers in the highly cited group. They involve innovation and professionalism, which means new concepts, methods, models, etc. In order to ensure the conciseness of the abstracts, information is condensed and details omitted, thereby raising the difficulty of reading and understanding of the abstracts. This result also confirms the conclusion drawn in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2, i.e. highly cited abstracts often reflect strong professionalism. In order to present the difference in readability more intuitively, we selected the following two sentences from the abstracts with Flesch Reading Ease Score of 1 and 57 respectively. ( 1) \"Superlenses have great potential in applications such as biomedical imaging, optical lithography and data storage.\" (2) \"It was observed that a total of 33 water harvesting structures were constructed between 2004 and 2007.\"",

In addition, these findings can be used to predict the scientific impact of the paper in the future through the abstract of the paper, which can effectively shorten the review time of journal reviewers and improve review efficiency. Admittedly, there are still some shortcomings in our research. Due to the large amount of papers contained in WOS database, only 10,000 papers with high citation rates and zero citation rates are selected as samples for analysis, which may not be enough to reflect the real situation of the overall data. Therefore, in the follow-up studies, we will increase the sample size and conduct in-depth research on the characteristics of most-cited abstract and zero-cited abstract according to different time periods.",

This implies that if a paper's abstract contains fewer nouns and verbs while contains more adjectives and adverbs, it will be more likely to be cited.With regard to the pronoun usage of the highly cited group, it tends to use more personal pronouns, especially the first person pronoun plural. However, the usage rate of the first person pronoun singular and the third person pronoun singular is lower than that of zerocited group. Although there is no significant difference in the incidence score of third person pronoun plural (p 5 0.265), the highly cited group scores 0.08 higher than the zero-cited group. This implies that the abstracts of highly cited papers reveal a tendency of having group personal pronouns such as \"we/our\". Yet first-person singular pronouns such as \"I/me\" are used less frequently. This is because scientific research is usually carried out by research ",

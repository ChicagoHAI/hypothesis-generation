    "abstract": "English persuasive writing is an important skill to be mastered by students as it is highly valued when and if students continue their studies to a higher education level. The objectives of this study are to: (1) identify the distinctive features of persuasive essays commonly adopted by Malaysian students; (2) investigate the problems students encounter while developing their arguments, and (3) to suggest strategies that can improve students' persuasive writing skills. Seventynine essay samples from four secondary schools were selected for the analysis and Toulmin's Model was employed as the tool for analyzing the essays. The focus of the analysis is to uncover the persuasive elements that the students have applied in their writing. The raw data were gathered by reading each of the essays and labeling the persuasive elements (claim, grounds, warrant, backing, rebuttal and qualifiers) which were identified. Findings from the analysis have indicated that the students applied the basic persuasive elements: claim, grounds and warrant. It was also discovered that the students lacked the optional persuasive elements; qualifier, rebuttal and backing. Students need to be exposed to new or alternative strategies of composing in order to help improve their persuasive writing skills.",

Persuasive writing is known to be complex and challenging, and it is difficult to learn and to master, especially when students have to write in another language of which they do not have full control. In particular, when learning the persuasive genre, second language (L2) student writers not only face difficulties with content but also in the structure and language while attempting to compose a persuasive essay (Crowhurst, 1990) . Students also find persuasive writing difficult due to its complex mode of discourse (Knudson, 2012) . Thus, it is not surprising that Malaysian students avoid the persuasive genre in the annual national exam Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM), preferring to write descriptive and narrative essays, which they are more familiar with (Rashid & Chan, 2008) .",

Amongst the most widely accepted tool to study persuasive writing is Toulmin's Model (Fei-Wen & Yueh-Miao, 2009 ). Toulmin's Model (Toulmin, 2003) breaks arguments down into six different elements, which are then divided into two groups. The first group, known as primary elements, form the foundation for the argument: 'claim', 'grounds', and 'warrant'. The second group of elements are known as auxiliary elements, which are optional, and can be used to strengthen the argument by complementing the primary elements; these elements are known as 'rebuttal', 'qualifier' and 'backing'. This study focuses on the quality of persuasive writing skills demonstrated by secondary school students and why a definitive instructional model is necessary to improve their persuasive writing skills.",

Teenagers today are only interested in Entertainment. Do you agree? Support your opinion. (SPM 2007) 4. Examinations--Good or Bad? (SPM 2008) Over the years, various models for persuasive writing instruction have been formulated to make writing tasks less daunting for students. For instance, in Malaysian schools, the five-paragraph essay model is used to teach students writing (Smith, 2008) . By identifying the paragraphs (introduction paragraph, 3-body paragraphs, and conclusion), students learn how to present, develop and summarize their ideas. Model essays are often used to teach essay writing (Tan, 2006) . Modelling can provide a basis for cohesive organization which is important during composition. However, the five-paragraph essay style does not fully satisfy the requirements needed for a strong persuasive argument. Despite its rigidity (Johnson et al., 2012) , under timed conditions as in the national examination, the format can be helpful as it allows the writer to formulate clearer arguments and gives them more time to develop ideas (Durst et al., 1990) .",

During examinations, students are expected to have the proficiency in persuasive essay writing despite the lack of extensive formal training in the area. For most students, they are forced to write persuasive essays without a clear foundation to begin with. Ideally, before the student can begin his argument, he must first present his points of view and then makes a stand (Ooi & Seelan, 2011) , telling the readers that he either supports or opposes the issue. As the student constructs his arguments, he must maintain his position of supporting or opposing the issue. Throughout the process of writing, the student needs to be aware of the audience. He also needs to support his opinions with facts, which can include quotations from texts, statistics, charts, graphs, scientific data and so forth (Lunsford, 2002) .",

From a cognitive perspective, writing is a problem-solving process shaped by the way the writer interprets the rhetorical problems posed by the purpose, the needs of the reader, the exigency of the situation, the goals that are set, and the strategies they control to solve the problem (Flower & Hayes, 1981) . From a social perspective, writing must take into account the discourse practice of writing through goal setting, task appreciation and juggling multiple demands (Fei-Wen & Yueh-Miao, 2009) . The Flower and Hayes' model (Flower & Hayes, 1981) describes writing as a cognitive process and sees writing as an application of ideas on paper. The model rightly suggests that writing is a highly complex, goal-directed and recursive activity. While it provides a proper framework for essay organization, reminding students to think about the topic and to recognize their audience while making corrections and revisions, the model is too procedural. It focuses more on the organization of the essay rather than the rhetorical content. Therefore, while beneficial to writing practice for novices, its lack of focus on the rhetorical genre does not make it a preferable model for persuasive writing instruction.",

Table 1 summarizes some of their findings. The Toulmin model measures credibility appeal, and the syntactic factor of Abstract vs. Situated Style were the best predictors of writing quality. The findings showed that the U.S. compositions scored lower compared to the British and New Zealand compositions on the use of grounds and warrant. There were also significant differences in syntactic features. The U.S. writers prefer to use colloquial and interactive features associated to Interactive vs. Edited Text. The U.S. compositions were less passive and used nominalized style compared to the British and New Zealand compositions. Pre-test and post-test essays, revealed overall improvement in students' argumentative writing and critical thinking skills. The mean scores between the pre-test and post-test results showed a significant positive difference. With Toulmin's Model, the subjects could analyze their essays and therefore improved the quality of their writing for each element. This shows that the subjects' critical thinking skills have improved. Thus, the results concluded that with Toulmin's Model as scaffolding, students can improve the quality of their persuasive writing and critical thinking skills.

Stapleton (2001) carried out a study to assess the critical thinking level of Japanese University students based on their writing using the Toulmin's Model as reference. He collected essay samples which were written in response to two essays that were written for two different topics. Based on the results of the study, he concluded that argument (claim), evidence (grounds) and recognition of opposition (rebuttal) were key components of argumentation. Stapleton (2001) criticised the use of familiar content as it encourages well-rehearsed reasoning as students regurgitate facts provided by the media. While unfamiliar topics would require more time, research and preparation, this also encourages the students to think outside of their comfort zone. However, during exams with a fixed time limit, students default to more familiar topics in order to compose an argument within the allotted time. Cahyono (2000) claims that instruction plays an important role in developing a student's performance. His study, which focuses on Indonesian university students, investigates rhetorical strategies that play an important role in developing a student's persuasive writing skills. Cahyono (2000) compared the writings of first year and fourth year students, which showed a significant difference in their skill level. The results were biased because the students in the fourth year had taken more courses and had more experience. Applying Toulmin's Model (Toulmin, 2003) to the analysis, Cahyono (2000) concluded that instruction plays an important part in developing the students' performance, and that the students' overall proficiency demonstrates the success of rhetorical strategies. Irish (2003) utilized the Toulmin's Model for a case study. He used Toulmin's Model as a writing strategy to improve the writing skills of an engineering student. At the end of the study, he concluded that the Toulmin's Model provides a framework for writers to check their work and helps writers to think about writing, while also acting as a composing tool that helps writers to develop their ideas and content. Therefore, the model greatly improves the student's persuasive writing skills and deepens his abilities to create solid and logical arguments.",

Do you agree? Support your opinion. (SPM, 2009) 4. The internet is mostly a good thing. Do you agree? Support your opinion. (SPM, 2010) Each collected essay was analyzed using Toulmin's Model to check for persuasive elements. The essay organization was analyzed to see how the students arranged and constructed their arguments with the persuasive elements they employed. The researcher read the essays and based on Toulmin's Model, identified the persuasive components from the sentences. Each of the sentences was coded based on the model and labeled as C for 'claim', G for 'Grounds, W for 'warrant', Q for 'qualifier, R for 'rebuttal, and B for 'backing'. The coding was then verified by an independent rater using the same method.",

The warrant in the example above provides a justification for the grounds to be linked to the claim. The warrant provides the logical justification for the claim and shows that the grounds are legitimate (Rafik-Galea et al., 2008; Irish, 2003) . In short, the grounds justify the claim and the warrant justifies the grounds. What can weaken an argument is a weak warrant (Toulmin, 2003) , thus a weak warrant can invalidate the argument. This is depicted in Figure 2 as shown below. Additionally, backing, rebuttal and qualifiers are used as auxiliary elements that can be used to strengthen the argument. The backing for an argument is made up of facts and general statements that support the warrant by answering different questions (Fei-Wen, 2010; Wood, 2001) . The backing establishes the reliability and relevance of the warrant and acknowledges exceptions which may invalidate the claim (Karbach, 1987) . An example of this is shown below:",

The following figure 4 is a paragraph that is being dissected and analyzed using Toulmin's Model. (Karbach, 1987) Figure 4 as illustrated by Karbach (1987) shows how Toulmin's Model is used to present specific facts, backed by general conclusion about those facts, leads to a general premise or a claim. All the elements are identified and labelled. First of all, the claim here is that \"Ann's bedroom is on fire\". This establishes the premise of the argument. This is proven in the next statement: \"Smoke is pouring from Ann's bedroom\". This is the 'grounds' that supports the claim. The warrant justifies this by stating smoke is a sign of fire. Once the foundation of the argument has been formed, the auxiliary elements are applied. First, the 'qualifier' which could be the conjunction \"because\" to demonstrate cause and effect. The 'rebuttal' here suggests that the fire was done deliberately through the use of chemicals. Finally, the backing is used to support the warrant by providing additional facts.",

The rejected 34 essay samples were discarded since the essays were incomplete or they did not reach the targeted minimum 250 words. According to Table 2 , 40 of the essay samples included the use of the auxiliary persuasive elements, rebuttal, qualifier and backing, while 39 did not include the auxiliary persuasive elements. This shows that over half of the essays written only utilized the three main elements of argumentative writing (claim or statement being argued, grounds that support the argument, and warrants that logically link the claims and grounds) presented in Toulmin's Model to construct the foundation for a strong argument. Table 3 shows the frequency count of essays utilizing claims, grounds and warrants, along with an optional element. A total of 29 essays utilized the primary elements and included one of the optional elements, either qualifier, rebuttal or backing. Backing is seen as being the most utilized of the optional elements. The low number of rebuttals is because the students mainly focused on one side of the argument and did not consider any counter-arguments. As few qualifiers are used, they may suggest the students were not well-versed in their use to modify and limit their arguments.

Many students thus select their teacher (or the examiner) as their audience (Connor, 1990) .",

They are able to make a claim, support their claim with grounds, and justify the grounds with a warrant. However, the students do not fully take advantage of all three optional elements to complement the primary elements and put too much emphasis on claim, grounds and warrant. Even when utilized, the optional elements are not used efficiently. Within the essays, there exists evidence that at least one optional element is included within a paragraph. At most, the students use a combination of two optional elements to complement the primary elements. Unfortunately, this is rarely done by the students. This is a problem as the optional elements are needed to further strengthen the arguments as qualifier, rebuttal and backing are still important to make the essay more credible (Fei-Wen & Yueh-Miao, 2009) .",

As a result, ESL learners encounter more difficulties and challenges while composing persuasive essays (Fei-Wen, 2012) . While Burkhalter (1995) states that students can improve their persuasive skills over time, this is hardly possible without proper guidance. According to Rashid and Chan (2008) , Malaysian schools focus more time on narrative and descriptive writing genres than the persuasive genre which is only included in the syllabus for Form 5. This lack of proper exposure to the persuasive genre in English results in students experiencing difficulties due to the complexity of the genre, making persuasive writing a difficult skill for students to master (Appleee et al., 1986) . The results of the study indicate that students require further guidance in writing a strong and valid persuasive essay.",

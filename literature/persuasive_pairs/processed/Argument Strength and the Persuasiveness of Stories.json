The aim of the current work was to shed light on the role of argument strength (argument quality) in narrative persuasion. The present study examined the influence of strong versus weak arguments on attitudes in a low or high narrative context. Moreover, baseline attitudes, interindividual differences in working memory capacity, and recipients' transportation were examined. Stories with strong arguments were more persuasive than stories with weak arguments. This main effect was qualified by a two-way interaction with baseline attitude, revealing that argument strength had a greater impact on individuals who initially were particularly doubtful toward the story claim. Furthermore, we identified a three-way interaction showing that argument strength mattered most for recipients who were deeply transported into the story world in stories that followed a typical narrative structure. These findings provide an important specification of narrative persuasion theory.",

                "text": "Since ancient times, religious leaders, politicians, and marketers have relied on stories to change people's attitudes, beliefs, and behavior (Gottschall, 2012) . Empirical research has repeatedly demonstrated the power of narratives to persuade recipients, even if the stories were introduced as fictional (e.g., Appel & Mara, 2013; Green & Brock, 2000; Prentice, Gerrig, & Bailis, 1997) . Narratives often engage the recipient and transport him or her into the world of the story (transportation; Gerrig, 1993; Green & Brock, 2000) . This state of transportation, rather than the elaboration of arguments (cf., Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) , is considered to play a key role in narrative persuasion. In contrast to theory and research on non-narrative communication (Chaiken, 1980; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) , narrative transportation theory suggests that argument strength plays a minor role in narrative persuasion (e.g., Green & Brock, 2002; Slater, 2002) . One of the possible causes put forward to explain the minor role of argument strength is that when transported into a story, recipients lack sufficient working memory resources to scrutinize arguments. To test this assumption, the aim of the present study was to examine the role of argument strength in narrative persuasion. Extending prior studies in the field, we manipulated the strength of the arguments included in the story as well as the narrativity of the story. We also measured baseline attitudes and the levels of self-reported narrative transportation. Moreover, we examined whether individual differences in recipients' working memory capacity affected the role of argument strength in narrative persuasion.",

Stories entail the actions and experiences of one or more protagonists and a plot line with certain schematic elements (e.g., setting, event, attempt, reaction, and consequence; Rumelhart, 1975) . In recent years, empirical research has demonstrated that fictional as well as nonfictional narratives can have a pervasive impact on attitudes and beliefs about real-world issues (narrative persuasion; e.g., Green & Brock, 2000; Prentice et al., 1997) , on knowledge and memory (Fazio & Marsh, 2008; Marsh, Meade, & Roediger, 2003) , and on social abilities and personality (Fong, Mullin, & Mar, 2013; Mar & Oatley, 2008) . In some of these studies the stories as a whole or their main narrative arc suggested a particular stance toward a topic (e.g., a story about a psychiatric patient who murdered a child led recipients to have more negative beliefs about the group of psychiatric patients; Green & Brock, 2000) . In other studies, the stories included assertions that were not a key element of the plot (e.g., Appel & Richter, 2007; Dahlstrom, 2010; 2012; Prentice et al., 1997) . Prior research indicates that the persuasive influence of narratives can be quite durable, being strong even after two weeks (Appel & Richter, 2007) .",

After this journey, they return to real life somewhat changed by the story events. When highly transported, \"all mental systems and capacities become focused on the events occurring in the narrative\" (Green & Brock, 2000, p. 701) . The resulting mental state has been conceptualized as a co-activation of attention, imagery, and emotion (e.g., Green, 2004; Green & Brock, 2000) .",

Not all texts that qualify as narratives are equally likely to elicit transportation. Stories that are well written and well structured are more transporting (Green & Donahue, 2009) . Transportation is encouraged by stories that are made with high craftsmanship and adhere to the narrative format (Green & Brock, 2002) . Differences in these and related qualities and characteristics within the field of narrative have been subsumed under the concept of narrativity. Narrativity is a scalable feature, meaning that a text (defined broadly, including oral discourse and audiovisual media) can have a greater or lesser degree of narrativity (e.g., Fludernick, 2002) . Well-written literary texts often include stylistic techniques such as metaphor or foregounding (cf. Miall & Kuiken, 1994) , and literary texts were found to be more transporting than prose developed for the purpose of an experiment (Green & Brock, 2000) . Likewise, disrupting the text structure and thereby reordering the events (while keeping the content intact) leads to lower transportation scores (e.g., Gnambs, Appel, Schreiner, Richter, & Isberner, 2014; Wang & Calder, 2006) . Little is known, however, about the influence of argument strength on transportation. Although it is conceivable that poor arguments embedded in a story might disrupt transportation, a study by Gnambs et al. (2014) that compared stories with weak versus strong arguments did not find any evidence for such an effect of argument strength on transportation.",

Moreover, studies examined whether baseline attitudes closely related to the beliefs advocated in the story predicted transportation. The results are somewhat inconclusive. Whereas Dal Cin et al.

The more recipients are transported into the story world, the more their cognitive and emotional processing is focused on the story world and the less their processing is focused on the immediate surroundings (such as the room in which a story is read) or other information that is unconnected to the story (such as an upcoming sports event). As recently pointed out by Bezdek and Gerrig (2016) , the selfreport scales used to measure transportation (such as the Transportation Scale; Green & Brock, 2000) include items on attentional focus (e.g., \"While I was reading the narrative, activity going on in the room was on my mind,\" reverse coded; see also the narrative engagement scale by Busselle & Bilandzic [2009] , which includes an attentional focus subscale).",

These vivid images of the story world are considered to be a key ingredient of story impact (Gerrig, 1993; Green & Brock, 2002; van Laer et al., 2014) . With respect to the influence of strong versus weak arguments, attention and imagery likely facilitate the processing of arguments. Thus, for highly transported recipients, argument strength should matter more than for less transported recipients. In line with this reasoning, Quintero Johnson, Harrison, and Quick (2013) identified a positive relationship between transportation and self-reported systematic processing of a story that included health-related information.",

                "text": "Building intense imagery, however, could have a reverse effect on the influence of argument strength on narrative persuasion. Rich imagination likely consumes cognitive resources or working memory resources that are not available for competing simultaneous cognitive tasks (Green & Brock, 2002) . Thus, being transported into the story world is supposed to be incompatible with demanding cognitiveelaborative activities such as counterarguing (Busselle & Bilandzic, 2009; Dal Cin et al., 2004; Green & Brock, 2000; Slater & Rouner, 2002) , which is known as a key obstacle to persuasive efforts (e.g., Brock, 1967; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) . Drawn into the story world, recipients might lack sufficient working memory resources to engage in a thorough analysis of the communication. Moreover, if a tale is gripping and the experience is pleasant, the motivation for elaborative activities may be low (Green & Brock, 2002) . From this perspective, the influence of argument strength on attitude change should be limited, given that recipients of stories lack the cognitive resources to scrutinize information included in a story. Tentative evidence in support of this hypothesis can be found in advertising research. Recipients who saw a print ad and imagined using the advertised product were less influenced by variations in argument strength than recipients who saw the print ad but did not imagine product use (Escalas, 2004; 2007; Lien & Chen, 2013; Praxmarer, 2011) . Transferred to the effects of stories, these findings suggest that argument strength matters less when stories follow a typical story-structure or recipients are highly transported into the story world or both.",

Factors that influence an individual's ability (such as the speed at which assertions are presented; Smith & Shaffer, 1995) or the motivation to engage in elaboration (such as the personal relevance of a topic; cf., Johnson & Eagly, 1989) in turn affect the likelihood that strong arguments yield higher persuasion than weak arguments (cf. Carpenter, 2015; Petty & Wegener, 1998) . Moreover, the influence of argument strength was found to vary with the disparity between recipients' pre-exposure attitudes and the stance implied by the message. The more negative the pre-exposure attitude with respect to an advocated position, the more influential were manipulations of strong versus weak arguments (Johnson, Smith-McLallen, Killeya, & Levin, 2004) .",

Supporting the assumption of different processes underlying the persuasion through narrative versus non-narrative texts, no consistent influence of the need for cognition was found for recipients' transportation into the story world (Appel & Maleckar, 2012; Green & Brock, 2000) or the persuasive impact of narratives (Appel & Richter, 2007; Green & Brock, 2000; Wheeler, Green, & Brock, 1999) . Regarding the ability to elaborate, it has been suggested that working memory capacity might moderate the influence of argument strength within a persuasion framework (Barrett, Tugade, & Engle, 2004) . Elaboration requires cognitive resources and controlled processing. Thus, individuals lower in working memory capacity may not be able to effectively suppress nonrelevant information while focusing on and deliberately elaborating the content of a presented persuasive message. Individuals low in working memory capacity are more vulnerable to interference effects, which results in weaker performance in secondary tasks compared with individuals high in working memory capacity (e.g., Conway, Cowan, & Bunting, 2001; Kane & Engle, 2000; Rosen & Engle, 1998) . However, an extensive literature research did not yield any studies in which working memory capacity was empirically related to argument strength in the context of persuasion, neither for non-narrative nor for narrative texts.",

To guarantee that the narrativity manipulation did not affect the content of the texts and thereby influence argument strength, identical content was presented with intact versus disrupted narrative structure (Wang & Calder, 2006) . We expected that transportation would be influenced by story narrativity. We were more reluctant to assume an effect of argument strength on transportation, given the paucity of prior research and even one study that did not find this effect (Gnambs et al., 2014) .

We instructed the participants of the pilot study to indicate how suitable each reason was to convince a friend to agree to the claim and to provide their judgments on a seven-point scale with higher scores indicating stronger arguments. The participants were undergraduates; 127 students rated arguments for three of the topics, and 156 students rated arguments for the fourth topic. 1 Argument strength ratings ranged from 1.66 to 3.87 (M = 2.97, SD = 1.64) for the weak reasons and from 3.93 to 6.34 (M = 4.89, SD = 1.77) for the strong reasons.

Each story consisted of five paragraphs and incorporated one paragraph in which a character made a claim supported by three reasons. In the high narrativity condition, the stories had a smooth, linear, chronological flow, whereas in the low narrativity condition, the elements of the stories were scrambled to disrupt the plot line without making it incomprehensible. The paragraph that contained the belief-relevant topic always remained at the same position, which was the fourth of five paragraphs. This method was successfully used in previous studies to manipulate transportation (e.g., Appel, Gnambs, Richter, & Green, 2015; Voss, 1 In the pilot sample of 127 undergraduates (78 women), we also assessed the agreement to the four claims included in the experiment proper. On a seven-point scale (1 = completely disagree with the claim, 7 = fully agree with the claim), the mean endorsement ranged from 2.38 to 4.51. This indicated that the claims were not extremely popular, leaving a potential for belief change in our main study. Wiley, & Sandak, 1999; Wang & Calder, 2006) . In addition, the texts varied with respect to the strength of the three reasons that supported the statement. Thus, the arguments, pretested in the pilot study reported above, were either high in argument strength or low in argument strength.

The reading span task (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Oberauer, S\u00fc\u00df, Schulze, Wilhelm, & Wittmann, 2000) served as the measure of working memory capacity. The reading span task required the participants to read 84 unconnected sentences presented in blocks. For each sentence, the participants had 5 seconds to decide if it was true or false. Additionally, they had to memorize the last word of each sentence. The number of sentences presented per block was incrementally increased from three to seven. After each block, the participants had to recall the end-of-the-sentence words of the block. Items were only counted as correct if the right word was remembered at the right position within the specific block. The true or false judgment was not analyzed in the end, but the participants were made to believe that it was an important part of the task. This prevented the participants from adopting a strategy that focused on the final words without devoting much attention to the reading of the sentence. It has been shown (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980 ) that the reading span task is especially suitable to measure working memory as related to reading abilities because it requires text processing and storing. The reading span task was scored as recommended by Friedman and Miyake (2005) by averaging the proportion of correct words per block across all blocks.",

The six self-report items (with seven-point response scales, ranging from 1 to 7) describe the cognitive, emotional, and imagery involvement in a narrative (e.g., \"I could picture myself in the scene of the events described in the narrative\" or \"The narrative affected me emotionally\").

For each topic addressed by the statements, participants answered five attitude items (e.g., \"The cloning of plants has significant positive effects,\" \"There should be more information about the negative consequences of smoothies\"), yielding 20 attitude items altogether.

The Pinocchio circling task was introduced at the very end of the experiment after participants had read all four stories and after all dependent variables were assessed. To ensure participants only focused on the part of the story that contained the arguments in their responses, we changed the traditional instructions of the thought listing and the Pinocchio circling tasks (Cacioppo & Petty, 1981; Green & Brock, 2000) . The results suggest that these instructions were misspecified, because most participants did not follow the instructions as expected.

Moreover, multilevel analyses allow examining main effects as well as interaction effects of continuous and categorical predictors located on different levels (participants and topics). The independent variables argument strength and narrativity were incorporated as contrast-coded predictors with fixed effects. The variables reading span, transportation, and baseline attitude were entered in the model as z-standardized predictors (fixed effects).

From an argument strength perspective, the interaction shows that argument strength matters most for individuals who were initially more skeptical toward the story message (simple main effect for a baseline attitude 2 standard deviations below the mean: B = .30, SE B = .08; t(1,600) = 3.79, p < .001; simple main effect for a baseline attitude 2 standard deviations above the mean: B = -.07, SE B = .08; t(1,602) = -.87, p = .39). The effect of argument strength was further qualified by a three-way interaction with narrativity and transportation (Fig. 2 ). Argument strength mattered most in the high narrativity condition, provided that individuals were transported into the story world. Simple slope analyses showed that if the story was high in argument strength and high in narrativity, the extent to which participants were transported into the story world had a positive influence on postexposure attitudes (B = .18, SE B = .09; t(1,072) = 2.10, p = .04), whereas there was no significant relationship between transportation and attitude in the other groups (for all effects: |t|< 1.30, p > .19).",

Whereas argument strength is a key factor in classic persuasion theories (Chaiken, 1980; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986) , little is known about its influence in narrative persuasion. To address this research lacuna, a repeated-measures experiment was conducted in which argument strength and narrativity were manipulated. Postexposure attitudes served as the dependent variable, and the design further included an assessment of working memory capacity, baseline attitudes, and transportation. We found that in all four experimental conditions, attitudes shifted in the direction of the story's message. Stories with strong arguments, however, were more persuasive than stories with weak arguments. This main effect was qualified by a two-way interaction with baseline attitudes, indicating that argument strength mattered most among individuals who were particularly skeptical toward the story claim before they read the story. We further identified a three-way interaction of argument strength, narrativity, and transportation: Provided that a story had an intact story structure (high narrativity), argument strength mattered most for recipients who were deeply transported into the story world-only when transportation was high, strong arguments were more persuasive than weak arguments. When the story structure was disrupted (as in our operationalization of low narrativity), transportation was unrelated to persuasive effects. On the one hand, this finding is in line with transportation theory which posits that transportation can explain narrative effects in stories but not in nonstory formats. It is also in line with the notion that attention is an integral part of transportation (Bezdek & Gerrig, 2016; Green & Brock, 2000) and a study that revealed a positive link between transportation and self-reported systematic message processing (Quintero- Johnson et al., 2013) . On the other hand, this finding appears to be at odds with basic theoretical work on narrative persuasion. Van Laer et al. (2014) , for example, summarize prior theory stating that \"narrative transportation is a mental state that produces enduring persuasive effects without careful evaluation of arguments\" (p. 800).",

To reduce unwanted influences of carry-over effects, the stories were presented in counterbalanced order and the pre-exposure attitudes were assessed along with filler items at least 7 days before the main experimental session. Essentially, the counterbalancing of the order of experimental conditions rules out a systematic influence of story position (e.g., reading the first story vs. a later story) on our results. Nonetheless, we conducted additional analyses controlling for potential effects of text position. These analyses showed that transportation decreased with text position, but the pattern of our key results remained unaffected.

The current study shows that even weak arguments embedded in stories can persuade but that argument strength increases the persuasive impact, particularly if recipients are initially rather skeptical toward an issue, and that argument strength matters most when individuals are deeply transported into a story of high narrativity. Thus, researchers and practitioners can expect the highest narrative impact if a good story contains strong arguments and recipients are deeply immersed into the story world.",

Agricultural companies can make good money from the cloning of plants.A major advantage of cloning is that the characteristics of the plant type that are fixed in the genome can be kept intact. Cloning is supported by some Nobel Prize winners. A \"plant clone\" is nothing but an offshoot, which sometimes also occurs naturally without human intervention. Eating salad is less healthy than people thinkThe look of salad reminds many people of animal food.The salad available in shops often contains many germs. A society's orientation toward a diet rich in salad and other vegetables endangers the meat producing and processing industry.Salad is often contaminated with heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium, and quicksilver, and with residues of pesticides. The preparation of salad is far too time-consuming. Lettuce leaves, especially when cultivated in a greenhouse, are enriched with nitrate, which is transformed into noxious nitrite by the human body. Tuition fees yield positive consequences for students Tuition fees lead to a useful competition between universities.It is only fair that students who benefit longer from the university's services also have to pay more. If some students cannot afford the fees, there will be more resources for the students who can.With the students' financial contributions, considerably more money can be invested in teaching, which enhances the educational quality enormously. If students have to pay tuition fees, then less money is available for irrational spending.With tuition fees, more teaching staff can be employed. As a consequence, professors have more time for each student, which, for example, has a positive impact on the supervision of theses.",

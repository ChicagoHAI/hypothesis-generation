    "abstract": "In this article we take the use of examples as a means to explore the processes of persuasion and consensus-construction involved in the legitimation of popular management knowledge. Examples, as concrete instances or events used to substantiate a wider argument, have been variedly regarded in different research traditions. Classical logic and rhetoric have considered them an inferior form of argument, useful for pedagogic or public debate but inadequate for higher forms of thought. This spirit still permeates much psychological research on communication, where the great persuasive import of examples has been contrasted with more scientific and formal resources for argumentation. Considered in this light, the contingent and episodic nature of examples seems to make them cognitively inferior to explicit statements of general rules. However, various strands of research on the nature of scientific knowledge have shown that implicit forms of knowledge are an integral part of scientific expertise. Examples may thus be more central to disciplinary thought than the conventional normative view seems to allow. In this spirit, we explore the use of examples in a hotly contested field, that of popular discourse on business and management. The profusion of examples in this kind of writing has been often noted, and almost as often criticized. We seek to explore more fully how these examples are deployed, examining the discursive devices that mark examples within the development of the text, their function as rhetorical moves, and their role in presenting arguments that are never otherwise made explicit.",

Their sheer prevalence in both everyday and formal speech seems to obscure the strategic role they play in most forms of expository or persuasive discourse. Examples seem not a rhetorical choice, but rather a natural fact of communication. Nevertheless, they possess great discursive and cognitive depth. Being episodic and often narrative, examples are much richer in features than the general rules they are supposed to illustrate. As they always frame general claims in a specific light, with the concrete features of a particular instance, the message they convey is never entirely coincident with the premise that they support.",

While traditional theories of demonstration considered it a shortcoming in their logic validity (Aristotle, 1984) , inferior to that of scientific proof, current research on knowledge accumulation and transmission has argued that it constitutes an essential element in higher cognition (Collins, 2001; Kuhn, 1970) . From this point of view, abstract categories can never be entirely detached from the concrete experiences, and all forms of thought retain traces of the specific exemplars upon which they are modelled. Strategies and patterns of exemplification thus go beyond a matter of rhetorical design to crucially impact on the interpretive process that gives rise to the meaning of a text.",

Since the publication of Peters and Waterman (1982) , the first best-seller to go beyond the specialized market to be read by a general audience, management books have gradually become entrenched as a staple of contemporary popular culture. The phenomenon has not failed to attract attention from scholars in business and organization, and has been the occasion for heated arguments about the nature and validity of their content. After briefly reviewing previous studies on the subject, we examine how examples are presented and functionally characterized. We then turn to an exploration of how examples are deployed to persuasive effect in popular management texts, before discussing our findings in the larger context of knowledge construction in disciplinary communities.",

However, as his theory of rhetoric was conceived as a further application of the general theory of demonstration, examples were viewed as falling short of the standards set for serious thought, and reasoning based on such basis was deemed fit for the kind of 'persons who cannot take in at a glance a complicated argument, or follow a long chain of reasoning' (Aristotle, 1984 (Aristotle, : 1357a)) . Cicero (1996 Cicero ( [1942]] ) held a similar opinion, valuing examples for their ornamental value and the warrant they provide for the ethos of the speaker, rather than for their contribution to cognition.",

In their idiosyncratic taxonomy, arguments employing examples occupy an important place. They do not view such arguments as echoing logical forms, but rather as devices seeking to establish the structure of reality, as they are concerned with obtaining assent to a general conclusion about the world based on already-known or accepted premises. They distinguish argument by example proper, being the presentation of several regular cases to persuade of a general thesis, from illustration, where examples are used to add weight or import to generalizations already shared between rhetor and audience. Finally, the sort of moral injunction used in medieval exempla is assigned to a third kind, called argument by model, where a case is described in order to guide the future actions of the audience. The description of an excellent or exemplary instance does not ground its normative value in frequency, but rather on exceptional rigour or purity, hoping to lead the audience to imitation.",

In the face of the serious problems attached to the traditional theory of concept formation -such as the lack of clearly expressible definitions for everyday concepts, and the evidence for fuzzy boundaries in category membership -research on cognition focused on how categorization rules were derived from concrete instances. Two main types of theories were produced to explain this, both focusing on relations of similarity, but differing in the process that led to their inference.",

Nevertheless, they helped raise interest in the cognitive function of examples in communication. As concrete exemplars were shown to enter into the formation of general knowledge, research focused on the cognitive import of examples provided in persuasive or informative discourse. Most researchers in this field follow psycholinguistic usage and speak of exemplars rather than examples.

Experimental measures indicate that readers' estimate of the frequency of certain events tends to be linked to how often they are depicted in a text, while explicit statistical descriptions tend to be disregarded (Zillmann et al., 1992) . Brosius and Bathelt (1994) found, in addition, that the stance expressed in the examples also influences the readers' evaluation of the subject. Interestingly, subjects do not find a text biased or inconsistent even when the selection of examples contradicts the information expressed in statistical form. Strange and Leung (1999) hold that the effect of examples on judgement does not proceed from explicit impression generalization -that is, that they may effectively affect judgement or appreciation of causes without leading the subjects to consciously modify previous descriptive beliefs about the issue. This seems to explain why examples are compatible with contradictory base-rate information, and suggests that the schemata and models they elicit are not necessarily tested for coherence with other semantic information.",

                "text": "The range of topics, genres and subjects covered by these studies is limited. In this article we do not deal with the thorny issue of whether exemplary or statistical evidence is 'more' persuasive, not least because making such a comparison in the precise, quantitative manner many of the above-quoted studies pursue requires so much abstraction from discursive and contextual factors as to risk irrelevance. The very sophisticated statistical apparatus employed in some of them obscures the fact that any attempt to extrapolate their results to cases dealing with anything but the reading college students make of issues they neither know nor care much about, in highly stereotyped genres and formats, is likely to be fruitless, but it seems reasonable to accept their claim that examples may be strongly persuasive even when not laid out as a specific form of argument. This has often been explained in terms of the theory of heuristics (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) , which argues that evaluations and predictions are seldom made using all potentially available information. Rather, strategies are employed that operate on a more limited range of data, trading accuracy for processing speed. Studies have suggested the existence of a representativeness heuristic -the process of judging an observed sample of data to be reliably indicative of the characteristics of an entire population despite considerations of size and sampling methods -and an availability heuristic -the disproportionate influence of easily retrievable information in the construction of the mental model. Thus, Brosius and Bathelt (1994) hold that statistical data are discarded because of the effort of processing them accurately. Gibson and Zillmann (1994) add that concrete examples are more salient and tend to attract more attention, thus earning a more central place in the information-building routines. Also promising is the notion that the episodic structure of narratives provides a cognitive interface that is intrinsically more accessible than that of abstract information (Bruner, 2002) . Brosius (1999: 215) asserts that, in the extensive literature available, no single variable can explain the persuasive power of examples besides structure itself: 'it is obviously an inherent quality of exemplars that makes recipients' judgements so strongly influenced by their distribution'.",

Rather than unilaterally determining discursive processes, categorization is driven by the social and interactional goals of discursive action.

This entails that there is no clear difference between forms of categorization deliberately and overtly presented by a speaker who argues that x is an instance of y -traditionally called propositional classifications -and the semantic grouping of classes of objects built into the grammar and lexicon of a discourse; in both cases, it is the social goals pursued by the speaker that lead them to select a form of expression, and its uptake by the interlocutors depends in turn on their own goals and purposes.",

Examples are episodic representations of singular events, but their discursive deployment selectively cues features and traits for the formation of a meaningful mental model of what the text is about. This cognitive guidance implicitly drives the generalization process that leads to category construction. Despite their concrete nature, examples are thus always tied to the formulation of the general rules constituting semantic knowledge about the world. This view has much in common with that held by Lyons (1989: x) , who argues that [a]n example is a dependent statement qualifying a more general and independent statement by naming a member of the class established by the general statement. An example cannot exist without (a) a general statement and (b) an indication of this subordinate status. This description, however, seems overly restrictive in its definition of examples. It seems in principle possible that the semantic rules being established through examples never be made fully explicit in the text, but rather cued only by the selective presentation of exemplary traits. In fact, descriptive theories of discourse structure -such as the Rhetorical Structure Theory of Mann and Thompson (1988) -have argued that most functional relations in text lack surface marks.",

Certain constraints are evident: to qualify as an example, a stretch of text must be more concrete and less general than the rule it is related to, but this still gives ample room for strategic deployment. Beyond this, there is little agreement on what are the defining traits of exemplification. Any episodic content may have an exemplary function given the appropriate contextual and co-textual cues. And examples themselves may serve a variety of rhetorical purposes, as the different functions ascribed to exemplification in the literature show. Longacre (1983) , for example, considers exemplification to be a case of illustration and thus an elaborative device, defined in essence by the addition of concrete information to an abstract formulation. Halliday and Hasan (1976) focus instead on its illocutionary potential for granting evidence to a claim. Knott and Dale (1993) distinguish exemplification from the addition of information, arguing that one cannot substitute for the other without altering a text's meaning, but they do not address its pragmatic intent at all. Hobbs (1985) , who does take this dimension into account, views exemplification as intended to ease the reader's difficulties of comprehension by providing peripheral information about the discourse referents. Mann and Thompson (1988) regard elaboration as the main purpose of examples, although the constraint they place on this relationship -that the satellite should only supplement the information in the nucleus, and never contextualize it -makes some examples appear to fulfil a background role as well. Before exploring the different forms of example use in our corpus, we briefly present its specific nature, as well as the theoretical importance of examples to the study of management discourse.",

The quoted excerpts illustrating it come from two texts, representing diverging strategies within a disciplinary community deeply divided by issues of method, theories and goals (Engwall, 1995) . In Information Rules (henceforward IR), by Shapiro and Varian (1998) , authors make use of their own personal authority but openly draw from conventional forms of knowledge. Other authors openly disregard theoretical prediction and emphasize the impossibility to fully account for the context of managerial practice.

Identifying them as such depends on understanding the passage in the context of the adjacent rhetorical moves. It is the specific interactive purpose to which the text is put that provides the necessary prompts for correctly understanding their function. This shows that the relation between examples and rules can remain implicit under certain conditions, as writers believe their readership capable of recovering it from the text without the need for formal prompts. Actually, as shown in Table 1 , this is by no means an uncommon authorial strategy. We can see the three kinds of examples as a cline of metadiscursive emphasis. Selection from this repertoire is doubtlessly bound to the degree to which the text responds to a textual pattern already known to the reader. When generic conventions are violated or unclear, authors cannot rely on previously shared knowledge in the context model to guide the meaning and intent of the text (van Dijk, 2006) , and must employ explicit rhetorical resources to embed an interpretive roadmap into it. Similarly, texts with a pedagogic or directive bent often have to explicitly lay out rules for interpretation to compensate for the asymmetry in competence between author and reader (Crismore and Farnsworth, 1990; Hyland, 1998) .",

One should notice that the examples presented are, as in Excerpt 5, quite unlike the rule they claimed to illustrate: the printing and binding of books is not a digital process, nor is VHS copying, where data are stored in an analogue magnetic medium. But also the theoretical claims lack a connecting thread; the economic notion of 'information goods', centred on the consumption of meaning, has nothing to do with Shannon's coding parameters, which entirely disregard semantic aspects. Despite the incoherence, the rhetorical pairing serves a strategic goal. On one hand, the language of science serves to legitimize the text as an intellectual pursuit, presenting the authors as sophisticated users of complex theories, and soberly hedging their claims by reference to a specific theoretical standpoint. At the same time, it ensures that the particular theory endorsed is not one that readers are likely to challenge -not least because it is largely irrelevant to the main argument. When business concepts -which are more likely than semiotic ones to attract the interest of the buyers of a book subtitled A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy -are introduced, none of this disciplinary caution is exercised. The long list of items used to illustrate grounds the text again in reality, and pervasively establishes the mode of the text as one of descriptive identification. This shift from an ostensible process of persuasion, in which the validity of intellectual claims is jointly negotiated, to one of apparent description, where the text seems to simply describe the state of affairs, backgrounds the interpretive process exactly at the moment that it begins to be relevant to the text goals.",

Every day brought forth new technological advances to which the old business models seemed no longer to apply. Yet, somehow, the basic laws of economics asserted themselves. Those who mastered these laws survived in the new environment. Those who did not, failed. The effect of this presentation crucially depends on the misunderstanding it elicits on its readers, and its subsequent correction. Hints are plentiful: temporal deictic aside (the book was first published in 1998, when the reference to the end of the century would have been commonplace), the processes described in the passage are recognizably those attributed to the 'digital economies' of the Internet era. But, while unequivocal, this recognition is based in a frame of reference that is far from universal. By devising a text only intelligible to readers familiar with the financial media's excitement about Nasdaq and the antitrust case of United States of America v. Microsoft Corporation, they make a point of signalling the ideal reader they seek and the interests that will guide the thrust of the text. The exemplary introduction handles at once the need to ground the text in reality, showing as little interpretation as possible, and the decision to present it already embedded in the cognitive and evaluative habitus of a certain community.",

Finally, it enacts the relation of asymmetric competence on which the author-reader relationship is built in a very graphic manner. As the guiding intervention by the authors is strongly backgrounded until the second paragraph, the erroneous interpretation of the situation seems to be entirely the fault of the readers -corrected in turn by the authors' ability to see through the misleading appearance of events. This is reinforced by the elegant, if deceptive, use of parallelism: all sentences in the first paragraph share the same basic structure, declarative sentences in a definitely realis mode, although the 'basic laws of economics' are a very different kind of participant from 'the public', 'entrepreneurs' or 'the government'.

Claiming 'durability' and 'proof ' for one's own work, in the absence of further arguments, is simply an empty show of commitment to traditional scientific values -the kind of argument that often gets dismissively called 'rhetoric'. This particular text falls short of its own measuring yard in several respects. Forecasting in the absence of hard empiric data is evident, for instance, at the end of Excerpt 3.2. The use of analogy is far more pervasive, and especially intensive as regards the 'battle' metaphor for business practice. Frequent to the point of catachresis in financial and business speech (Koller, 2004) , the mapping is similar to the 'ARGUMENT is WAR' one studied by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) . Both 'war' (once) and 'battle' (six times) feature in the lexical repertoire used to describe market competition in the first chapter of IR; a later one is entitled 'Waging a Standards War'. 'Rivalry', 'aggression', 'allies', 'sword', 'vulnerable' and the crucial term 'strategy', are other elements reinforcing this set of analogue representations, which is likely to be responsible in no small degree for the vividness and persuasive character of the offered models. It would not be hard to point out other conceptual metaphors underwriting the analysis, such as 'MARKET is NATURE', with its 'giants', its laws of 'evolution' and its 'breathlessness'. Testing their claims about buzzwords would require cumbersome statistical analysis, infeasible within the limits of this article; we are, nevertheless, more interested in how the comparison serves to demarcate currents within management writing. Downes and Mui's attempts at forecasting do not show any of this disciplinary circumspection. UTKA is cavalier about the specifics of future happenings and developments, to the point of presenting them sometimes in the present tense, as part of an ongoing but already established process: At the same time, this certitude about the future is curiously coupled with an explicit criticism of systematic analysis and planning. The following excerpt, a dramatic punch line to the extended narrative that introduces the book, clearly states the text's stance towards the interface of theory and practice:",

The use of personal pronouns and other personal markers is one of the main linguistic realizations in which this is embodied; exclusive 'you' clearly establishes a contrast between author and reader, assigning them very different roles in the text. Hyland (2002) argued that personal pronouns can play a significant role in building an image of certainty by foregrounding the presence of the writer in the text, far from the conventional pluralis modestiae. This function is emphasized by the contrastive presentation, marking distance between author and reader. Notice as well the rhetorical question, which in English prose and speech is customarily employed to provide a semblance of interaction -bearing the ostensible markings of conversation, where the coparticipant is expected to cue in at the end of the turn -although their basic orientation is directive (Taiwo, 2005) .

Moore's proposition is labelled a 'law', but described in terms of a 'belief ' whose main claim to validity is Moore's confidence as shown in basing his business strategy on it. Notice the shift in mood from the description of precedence to the actual enunciation, where the simple present of the indicative settles it squarely within the realm of timeless general truths. Metcalfe's 'law' is presented in the multiple semiotic modalities of scientific assertion, including a plotted graph and an equation; it foregoes scientific conventions in glossing over previous research, which would have proved Metcalfe's to be simply a reformulation of the well-known economic theory of interdependent demand. However, far more interesting to our purposes is the corollary which Downes and Mui extract from their joint action: How can the thesis that the conjunction of distinct technological processes tends to spontaneously trigger society-wide disruptions in the form of products and processes whose value and impact could not be foreseen be tied to the book's alleged purpose of providing keys to business strategy? It seems evident that 'killer apps', whatever their nature and source, are by definition unpredictable. The challenge this poses for managerial thinking cannot escape acknowledgment. However, the text projects IR only as facing 'traditional' managerial thinking (see Excerpt 8); the approach advocated by Downes and Mui seeks to appear unaffected. The difference between traditional and contemporary management has often been viewed in terms of the mystique of the creative entrepreneur, prominent in the latter kind of writing (Alonso and Fern\u00e1ndez Rodr\u00edguez, 2006) . Analysts have intepreted it as a shift from modern bureaucratic modes of rationality to a premodern form of charismatic leadership. However, whatever their inspirational value, purely charismatic justifications of leadership cannot even purport to offer systematic guidance or strategy. The rationalistic elements of the scientific genres can help compensate for this, fitting this trend into the hybrid conventions of popular management discourse.",

As we saw in the opening narratives in Excerpts 10 and 11 the text uses common presuppositions and world-knowledge in its presentation of events and the orientation it provides. Most importantly, these cognitive frames and their interaction are not necessarily made explicit in a systematic whole.

We have shown that argumentation structures often follow a cyclical exemplification/generalization pattern, where the inherent interpretive richness of examples allows them to perform a variety of functions -establishing factuality, significance and desirability, often at the same time -and leading to textual forms less rigidly articulated than is usual in academic prose. We have also shown that the pervasive semblance of factuality conveyed by examples allows writers to embed arguments that would not seem warranted if the interpretive nature of the text were presented as such, multiplying the instances of a remote premise to enhance the credibility of a conclusion, or textually juxtaposing actions in order to suggest cause/consequence relations. Finally, we have discussed how examples are used to cue common assumptions about the world, evoking a disciplinary frame even for practice-oriented fields where orientation to theory is severely dispreferred. This situation leads to an epistemological curiosity: while sociological accounts of scientific knowledge have routinely found practitioners to be more conservative than academics, in management it is writers from the consulting camp who show more extreme positions as regards the impossibility to establish rules for professional practice. We argue that this has reasons in disciplinary conventions. A model of practice based on conventional, 'Whiggish' scientific tenets would hold that examples cannot be correctly assessed or understood without the backdrop of a theory that indicated the relevant parallels and the conceptual features in which the analogy is based; this is in itself an effect of a certain theory of scientific practice, where reflexive mutual control by competing practitioners determines the suitability of a proposal. In managerial practice, this underlying pattern is rather inferred from the practical effects, in terms of business success or failure, the theory provides.",

                "text": "Discussing a model or technique in terms of its practical results rather than circuitously debating the disciplinary background upon which it was gradually built allows writers to package their arguments in a much more compressed form. This type of textual structure has been called 'fast' (Bloor, 1999; Swales, 1990) because it allows writers to dispense with certain justificatory moves, assuming the readers' knowledge and acceptance of some crucial theses. Examples allow the writer to take for granted a large part of the interpretive apparatus that will be deployed in understanding the text. Just as (academic) citation practices offload part of the responsibility for the writer's claims to the cited author, thus ascribing the work to a larger disciplinary tradition in which the intended readers also share, exemplification invokes the common experience of professional practice and the tacit shared knowledge that is put to play in everyday encounters with problematic situations. However, while citations are explicit to some degree about the socially constructed nature of the evidence they adduce, examples tend to frame it as a direct encounter with the facts themselves, a slice of life brought to breathe life to an argument. John Lyons (1989: ix) , observing this characteristic, held that examples 'qualify as the most ideological of figures, in the sense of being the figure that is most intimately bound to a representation of the world and that most serves as a veil for the mechanics of that representation'. This is true, in a rather obvious sense, of the choice of examples; selecting the specific instances that are supposed to stand in for a more general concept allows the author to stipulate the traits that will be seen as typical, as well as guide the evaluations and reactions towards them. But other discursive features are no less important; selective salience, the specific semantic representation of exemplary features, and the degree and manner in which the example is isolated from or related to its original context are part of the textual work exercised upon the example to turn it into a useful rhetorical tool (Boddington and Hogben, 2006; Worsham, 1999) . As with any textual construct, examples never directly manifest facts or data; they employ them for a definite communicative purpose, 'reframing them into something that suits the direction of a text' (Lyons, 1989: ix) .",

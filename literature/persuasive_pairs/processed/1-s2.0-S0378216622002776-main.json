Then, after having provided an overview of the main hermeneutical stages involved in interpreting persuasive discourse, the paper focuses on the stage of argument type identification.

Related phenomena such as mis-and disinformation can have deleterious consequences, especially when they occur in communicative interactions aimed at changing people's minds or behavior, in short, in 'persuasive communication': efforts to convince people to believe or do something run the risk of being perverted into efforts to manipulate them into believing and doing something (Brave et al., 2022; Floridi, 2014) . Gaining a better insight into the cognitive aspects of how people process information in persuasive messages could contribute to finding a solution for such problems of the information age. However, empirical questions about how people process information aimed at changing their minds or behavior can only be answered after generating theoretically informed hypotheses about how people interpret the discourse containing that information. How does such an interpretation take place? Which elements, parts, characteristics, or aspects of persuasive discourse are relevant to consider?",

The criteria employed for such an evaluation are often 'external': they embody an ideal of reasonableness that deviates from how people evaluate persuasive messages in concrete cognitive environments. Examples of such normative ideals are the notion of a 'universal audience' (Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1958) , the 'geometrical' concept of argument validity (Toulmin, 1976) , and the 'ideal speech situation ' (Habermas, 1981) . In this paper, I propose a theory of interpreting persuasive discourse that does not presuppose such an Archimedean point but instead builds on insights about the production of such discourse from the 'philosophy of argument,' a field of research originating from the three classical disciplines logic, dialectic, and rhetoric e for a recent overview, see Wagemans (2021b) . These insights are 'pragmatic' in that they pertain to the use of language for persuasive purposes.",

From classical antiquity onwards, philosophers and rhetoricians have formulated guidelines for successfully producing such discourse, mainly by carefully observing a wide range of argumentative and persuasive practices and by theorizing about the factors that influence the success and failure of participants in achieving their communicative aims. Subsequently, they have generalized, ordered, and didacticized the instructions into a learnable system of production guidelines, in short, into an 'art'.",

Apart from rhetoric, the disciplines of dialectic and logic have played a crucial role in the development of the philosophy of argument. Dialectic is the art of debate, consisting of instructions for conducting a philosophical discussion. And logic can be characterized as the art of reasoning, i.e., as a set of instructions about how to conclude from premises in a successful, in casu, valid way. The three disciplines, then, while they focus on different subgenres and address other aspects of argumentative or persuasive discourse, can be seen as considerably overlapping and complementary sets of production guidelines for such discourse.",

The hermeneutical tradition from classical antiquity onwards has developed various theories and techniques of interpretation, focusing on myths, sacred and classical texts, and legal discourse. The need for interpreting such texts or speech follows from the idea that there are all kinds of discrepancies between the 'literal' or 'perceived' meaning of the text and its 'intended', 'spiritual' or 'original' meaning, which is believed to be lost, hidden under the surface, or distorted by conventions or previous interpretations.",

As Grondin observes, this brings hermeneutics in thematic relationship with rhetoric: 'Both have to do with conveying meaning, whereby rhetoric strives to convey the intended meaning to the persuasive expression and the hermeneutics goes back from the expression to the intended meaning ' (1996:1351, my translation) .

It is thus premised on the idea that the theoretical art of interpreting argumentative or persuasive discourse, which includes both its analysis and evaluation, mirrors the practical art of producing it. This methodology does not guarantee absence of discrepancies between how an argument is intended and how it is interpreted. After all, the arguer can, at most, aim to take the audience's viewpoint into account. 1 But since the guidelines for producing argumentative discourse reflect best practices and conventions about using language for persuasive purposes (independent from whether they have been applied consciously or not), they form a sound basis for developing a theory about how people usually interpret such discourse.",

For the inventio proper, the speaker or writer is provided with instructions regarding the use of the various means of persuasion (logos, ethos, pathos) as well as with lists of argument types based on which they can generate arguments in support of the point of view to be defended in the speech. The second main task, the dispositio, contains instructions about how to divide the speech into several parts and which content (generated during the inventio) should be expressed in which of these parts. The elocutio, finally, provides information about virtues (and vices) of style, various kinds of style, and lists of rhetorical figures and tropes that can be used for the embellishment of the speech.",

Like the stages distinguished within the production process of persuasive discourse, those distinguished within its interpretation process are not necessarily followed in a linear fashion. In fact, part of the problems regarding mis-and disinformation mentioned in the introduction might well be related to the addressee deviating from or taking short-cuts within the process of interpreting what has been produced by the speaker or writer. As noted earlier, gaining empirical knowledge about the nature and extent of these 'misinterpretations' requires a theory about how persuasive discourse is interpreted in the first place.

However, it also differs from these taxonomies in that the 'argument form' is not the only parameter considered in describing an argument type. Inspired by the classical dialectical and rhetorical taxonomies of arguments, two other parameters are also taken into account: the 'argument substance' and the 'argument lever'. In this respect, the PTA is in line with other theories of argumentation that seek to complement insights from logic with those from dialectic and rhetoric (van Eemeren et al., 2014) . At the same time, the PTA considerably differs from these endeavors: instead of providing an informal list of argument types (or argument(ation) schemes), it takes a 'parametric', 'combinatorial' or 'factorial' approach to argument classification by defining an 'argument type' as the unique combination of the values of three parameters (form, substance, and lever). This innovation not only enables the accommodation of any existing account of argument types in the more traditional sense of that term, be it from a logical, dialectical, or rhetorical origin, but also provides a systematic framework that can be used for comparative purposes.",

The statement 'The president is doing a great job', for example, is expressed as a proposition. In contrast, the statement 'I believe that the president is doing a great job' is expressed as an assertion. While both contain the proposition 'the president is doing a great job', the assertion additionally has the doxastic attitude marker 'I believe that', indicating the fulfillment of the sincerity condition of the speech act of asserting something. In the following, I will assume that it is possible to add a standard doxastic attitude marker 'is true (T)' as a predicate to any proposition ('a is X') or as a replacement of any other doxastic attitude marker explicitly present in the discourse -such as 'I believe that' in the above example. Any statement functioning as the premise or the conclusion of an argument can thus be expressed in two ways: as a proposition 'a is X', for example, 'The president (a) is doing a great job (X)', or as an assertion 'a is X is T', for example, 'The president (a) is doing a great job (X) is true (T)'.",

While classical rhetoricians like Quintilian himself used these categories to provide a systematic description of the possible variations in the wording of a speech, present-day pragma-dialecticians have used them to describe how their reconstruction of argumentative discourse deviates from their model of a 'critical discussion' (Lausberg, 1998: 217e229 ; van Eemeren et al., 2014: 535; Wagemans, 2021b: 574) . The use of the four categories of change as proposed in this paper takes place on a different and more detailed level of analysis, respectively: that of the recognition of the form of an individual natural argument. As an example, I provide in Tables 4 and 5 the records of the hermeneutical transformations involved in canonizing the two linguistic realizations of the first-order predicate argument just mentioned.",

Within the framework of the PTA, the lever is defined as the underlying mechanism of the argument that expresses the connection between the premise and conclusion, thereby answering the question of how that premise is supposed to fulfill its pragmatic function of increasing or establishing the acceptability of the conclusion. As such, the concept of the argument lever is related to the concepts of 'linking', 'missing', and 'implicit' premise. Unlike these concepts, however, the lever does not have the status of a premise. One reason is to avoid infinite regress problems: if the link between a premise and a conclusion counts as another premise, there should be yet another premise that links the link to the conclusion, ad infinitum. Instead, the argument lever is given a status of its own by defining it as the relationship between the premise and conclusion or, more specifically and depending on whether the predicate or the subject functions as the fulcrum, the relationship between the two predicates or the two subjects of the statements involved. The lever, for instance, of the first-order predicate argument mentioned above, 'Unauthorized downloading is not theft, because unauthorized downloading does not deprive the original owner of the use of an object', is the relationship between the predicate of the premise, 'does not deprive the original owner of the use of an object', and the predicate of the conclusion, 'is not theft'.",

Subsequently, I have focused on the third stage, argument type identification, providing a specification of the hermeneutics of argument type. For this purpose, I have worked from the assumption that a theory of interpreting the type of argument can be based on the instructions for generating arguments that are part of the classical task of the inventio, the 'finding' of the arguments (in the broad sense of the term). These instructions consist of descriptions and classifications, abbreviated as 'lists' of argument schemes (topoi, loci), fallacies, and means of persuasion (logos, ethos, and pathos). To maximize the extent to which the interpretation can be justified, I have worked with a systematic summary of these persuasive techniques as provided in the argument categorization framework of the Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA). Within this framework, an 'argument type' is conceived as a unique combination of values attributed to the parameters (1) argument form, (2) argument substance, and (3) argument lever. After having explained the parameters and the values they can take, I have provided their specific hermeneutics.",

The abstract lever is derived from the argument form because it is defined as the relationship between the non-common terms of the conclusion and the premise of the argument. In Table 8 , I called this 'derivative' hermeneutics. The formulation of the concrete lever requires more hermeneutical creativity. The analyst will have to come up with a keyword that connects these non-common elements, or, in other words, that concretizes the abstract lever by providing a specific description of the relationship between them. Since argument types are named after the keyword in the lever, the names of the argument types distinguished in the PTA can be used as a heuristic for finding the most relevant keyword. For this reason, in Table 8 , I called the interpretation strategy involved in formulating the concrete lever a 'comparative' hermeneutics.",

As explained in Section 2, the hermeneutical stage of argument type identification is preceded by the stages of argument detection and argument mapping and followed by that of argument evaluation. Further research needs to be done to develop specific hermeneutics for these stages as detailed as those developed in this paper, thus enabling the interpreter to use the output of argument detection and mapping as the input for argument type identification. Then, based on the identification of their type, the individual arguments can be evaluated by making use of normative insights about the quality of arguments as they are formulated in, for instance, Hinton (2021) and Hinton and Wagemans (2021) . As such, the complete hermeneutics may function as a starting point for developing a procedure for 'rhetoric-checking' (Plug and Wagemans, 2020) , 'reason-checking' (Visser et al., 2020; Musi and Rocci, 2022) , or 'argument-checking' (Brave et al., 2022) as an extension of 'fact-checking'.",

In this type of research, the procedures for argument detection, mapping, type identification, and assessment can be used to generate specific hypotheses about the way in which humans (and computers) interpret the text on the discourse level. These hypotheses are then tested empirically and fed back into the theory, thus enabling a further corroboration and refinement thereof. While the inclusion of an empirical component in the research cycle may particularly contribute to our knowledge about the assignment of values to parameters central to the hermeneutics of argument type identification spelled out in Section 3 of this paper, two additional remarks are in place. 2 First, it would be crucial to explore how the theory of interpreting argumentative or persuasive discourse developed in this paper could be integrated into well-researched corpus accounts such as, e.g., Koszowy et al. (2022) . Second, to further strengthen the general usefulness of the theory, it would be helpful to include an affective component in the method for argument type identification. The PTA's innovative method of describing characteristics of arguments in terms of a set of parameters and their values enables the incorporation of relevant insights about this component, as found in, e.g., Hample (2005 Hample ( , 2018) ) and Wirz (2018) . In fact, since the PTA takes a 'parametric' approach to argument description and classification, its theoretical framework can be extended with any parameters or values deemed relevant for specific types of research into argumentative or persuasive discourse.",

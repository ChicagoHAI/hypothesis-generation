    "abstract": "In many cases of disagreement, particularly in situations involving practical reasoning, it is impossible to demonstrate conclusively that either party is wrong. The role of argument in such cases is to persuade rather than to prove, demonstrate or refute. Following Perelman, we argue that persuasion in such cases relies on a recognition that the strength of an argument depends on the social values that it advances, and that whether the attack of one argument on another succeeds depends on the comparative strength of the values advanced by the arguments concerned. To model this we extend the standard notion of Argumentation Frameworks (AFs) to Value-based Argumentation Frameworks (VAFs). After defining VAFs we explore their properties, and show how they can provide a rational basis for the acceptance or rejection of arguments, even where this would appear to be a matter of choice in a standard AF. In particular we show that in a VAF certain arguments can be shown to be acceptable however the relative strengths of the values involved are assessed. This means that disputants can concur on the acceptance of arguments, even when they differ as to which values are more important, and hence that we can identify points for which persuasion should be possible. We illustrate the above using an example moral debate. We then show how factual considerations can be admitted to our framework and discuss the possibility of persuasion in the face of uncertainty and disagreement as to values.",

In some fields, such as mathematics, this is even the typical case. But in most areas of dispute involving practical reasoning, such as law and ethics, the case is rather different. As Perelman, whose New Rhetoric [9] has been highly influential in informal argument, puts it: If men oppose each other concerning a decision to be taken, it is not because they commit some error of logic or calculation. They discuss apropos the applicable rule, the ends to be considered, the meaning to be given to values, the interpretation and characterisation of facts. [10, p. 150 ",

Such disagreement is common in law. When a case is brought to court, it is because the two parties disagree about what should be done in the light of some set of particular circumstances. Often no conclusive demonstration of the rightness of one side is possible: both sides will plead their case, presenting arguments for their view as to what is correct. Their arguments may all be sound. But their arguments will not have equal value for the judge charged with deciding the case: the case will be decided by the judge preferring one argument over the other. And when the judge decides the case, the verdict must be supplemented by an argument, intended to convince the parties to the case, fellow judges and the public at large, that the favoured argument is the one that should be favoured. This means that the judge's preference for one argument over the other should be rational, or at least capable of rationalization.",

                "text": "One way of giving rationality to the preference is to relate the arguments to the purposes of the law under consideration, or the values that are promoted by deciding for one side against the other. Perelman [10] says that each party to a legal dispute 'refers in its argumentation to different values' and that the 'judge will allow himself to be guided, in his reasoning, by the spirit of the system, i.e., by the values which the legislative authority seeks to protect and advance' (p. 152). A key element in persuasion is identifying the value conflict at the root of the disagreement so that preference between values can explicitly inform the acceptance or rejection of the competing arguments. Becoming convinced is importantly bound up with identifying how the decision argued for advances the values one holds. Perelman makes much of the fact that an argument is addressed to an audience: in many cases this will be a particular audience with a particular set of values, and a particular ranking of them. As an example consider the regular debate as to whether taxes should be raised or lowered. Typically some will say they should be raised to promote social equality while others will says they should be lowered to promote enterprise. Both parties accept that the effects argued by their opponents will be achieved, and both regard greater equality and greater enterprise as good things. Which side they support, however, will depend on whether they value equality or enterprise more. In this case the dispute can only be resolved through choosing a preference. As we shall see, however, there are circumstances where particular arguments should be accepted by all audiences, however they choose to rank their values.",

                "text": "Since they were introduced in [6] , Argumentation Frameworks (AF) have been a fruitful way of looking at systems of conflicting argument. They do not, however, always provide a rational basis for preferring one argument over another: they can identify which points of view are defensible, but are often silent as to which should be preferred. In this paper we extend these Argumentation Frameworks to Value-based Argumentation Frameworks (VAF), to attempt to represent the kind of use of values to ground rational disagreement described above. We also show that VAFs have some nice properties which can be used to render tractable problems which are intractable in standard AFs, and to resolve certain disagreements which cannot be resolved in standard AFs. The introduction to The New Rhetoric concludes: Logic underwent a brilliant development during the last century when, abandoning the old formulas, it set out to analyze the methods of proof used effectively by mathematicians. . . . One result of this development is to limit its domain, since everything ignored by mathematicians is foreign to it. Logicians owe it to themselves to complete the theory of demonstration obtained in this way by a theory of argumentation [9, p. 10] Our intention in extending AFs to VAFs is to begin to provide this kind of completion.",

The nodes representing arguments are labelled with the conclusions of the arguments. This represents a situation where we do not know whether three propositions, \u00c8 \u00c9and \u00ca, are true or false. One type of argument is the simple assertion of a proposition; clearly this attacks, and is attacked by the assertion of its negation. We know, however, that \u00c8 \u00c9 and \u00ca are related, and we have arguments that conclude \u00c8 \u00c9 \u00c8 \u00c9 and \u00c9 \u00ca. The first of these is attacked by \u00c8, the second by \u00c8 and the third by \u00c9. The first and second of these attack \u00c9 and the third attacks \u00ca. From Figure 1 we can see that there are two preferred extensions: \u00c8 \u00c9 \u00ca \u00c8 \u00c9 \u00c8 \u00c9 \u00c9 \u00ca and \u00c8 \u00c9 \u00ca \u00c8 \u00c9 \u00c8 \u00c9 \u00c9 \u00ca .

I concede not \u00c8, and attack \u00c9 with \u00c8 \u00c9. Now my opponent cannot attack this with \u00c8, since this is attacked by the already asserted \u00c8.

We therefore define the notion of defeat for an audience: Note that an attack succeeds if both arguments relate to the same value, or if no preference between the values has been defined. If \u00ce contains a single value, or no preferences are expressed, the AVAF becomes a standard AF. If each argument can map to a different value, we have a preference-based argument framework [1] . In practice we expect the number of values to be small relative to the number of arguments. Many disputes can be naturally modelled using only two values. Note that defeat is only applicable to an AVAF: defeat is always relative to a particular audience. We write defeats \u00b4 \u00b5 to represent that defeats for audience , that is defeats in VAF . [6] introduces the important notions, described in Section 2, of acceptability, conflict free set, admissible set, and preferred extension for AFs. We next need to define these notions for an AVAF.

For red, which prefers red to blue, we get preferred \u00d6 is A,C . For blue, which prefers blue to red, however, preferred \u00d0\u00d9 is A,B . There are two points to note here: first that a sceptically acceptable argument in a value free framework may be rejected by a consideration of values, and second that some arguments, like in Figure 2 , may be acceptable irrespective of the choice of values. We will term arguments which are acceptable irrespective of choice of value preferences, that is acceptable to every audience, objectively acceptable. Arguments which are acceptable to some audiences, and in Figure 2 , will be termed subjectively acceptable. Note also that sceptical acceptance in the framework considered as an AF is not only not sufficient for objective acceptance, but is also not necessary. Suppose we add an attack from to in Figure 2 : now the preferred extension of the AF is empty, since we have a three-cycle: remains, however, objectively acceptable, since either it is not defeated by , or else is defeated by , which fails to defeat. Note that objective acceptance of an attacked argument requires that the number of values be smaller than the number of arguments: otherwise it is always possible to prefer the value of the attacker, and that value to that of any of its attackers. A VAF is most useful when the number of values is small, since a single choice of preference between values is then able to determine whether a number of attacks succeed or fail.",

An odd cycle means that nothing can be believed: it is akin to a paradox, and paradoxes are best avoided. Even cycles represent dilemmas, and require that a choice between alternatives be made. While such dilemmas have their place in cases of uncertainty, we believe that they should be resolved before practical arguments giving rise to them are advanced.

Each path will end with a chain of arguments with value \u00da, and then be followed by zero or more chains relating to other values. The first important observation is that, working back from the argument whose status is in question, once a new chain has been entered, no further arguments relating to v need be considered. This is so because either \u00da will be greater than the value of the next chain, call it \u00da \u00bd , or it will be less.

If it is less than \u00da \u00bd , then no subsequent argument relating to \u00da can have an effect on the status of arguments relating to \u00da \u00bd . This argument applies equally to the arguments in the chain relating to \u00da \u00bd with regard to the next chain should it relate to a different value. To have an effect each new chain must relate to a value ranked more highly than its predecessor.

She is not at home, but Hal enters her house and uses some of her insulin. Was Hal justified, and does Carla have a right to compensation? As presented by Coleman in [5] , the first argument is (A) that Hal is justified, since a person has a privilege to use the property of others to save their life -the case of necessity. But should Hal compensate Carla? His justification can be attacked by an argument (B) that it is wrong to infringe the property rights of another.

Christie, however, in [4] does not want to insist on compensation. He therefore introduces a fourth argument (D), which says that if Hal were too poor to compensate Carla, he should none the less be allowed to take the insulin, as no one should die because they are poor. Moreover, he says that since Hal would not pay compensation if too poor, neither should he be obliged to do so, even if he can. We thus have a life-based argument that defeats (C), assuming that life is valued more than property. This situation is shown in Figure 5 . If we accept (D), then (C) becomes subjectively acceptable, only allowed if we value property more than life. Note, however, that if we value life more than property, (B) is now accepted, its attacker (C) being defeated by (D). (A), however, remains objectively acceptable since its value is strong enough to resist the attack from (B) in this case and (B) is defeated in the other. Note that (D) can only be introduced without threatening (A) because the line of reasoning relevant to (A) terminates when the value pertaining to (A) is re-introduced.

But this would not achieve our ends, since it would repeat the property value. (Note also that (E) is attacked by (A)). If life is valued over property, (D) is not defeated, and while it is defeated if property is valued over life, it is unnecessary for the defence of (C) which resists (D) unaided. Resistance to Christie can only come from another life-based argument. For example, suppose we attack (A) on the grounds that Hal is endangering Carla's life (F). Now (F) will defeat (A), which Christie wants to defend. He can now attack (F) with (C): if Carla is properly compensated her life is not endangered. This scenario is shown in Figure 6 .

In the Hal and Carla example it is usual to include as part of the description that Hal checks that Carla has abundant insulin before using it, in order to exclude from the discussion the line of attack involving danger to Carla. That Carla has abundant insulin (G) clearly attacks (F). This scenario is shown in Figure 7 . Now in the dispute of the last section, the challenger was able to resist persuasion that (A) by preferring life to property. Can C continue to resist by preferring life to fact as well? I answer no: if Carla has abundant insulin, then (F) must fall since the circumstances are such that the desired good is not promoted. My solution is to treat fact as if it were a value, but fact is always the value with the highest preference for all parties. Whether we prefer life to property is a matter of choice, but to deny facts is to depart from rational argument by resorting to wishful thinking. This is accommodated by including in the initial state of the dispute preferences of the form fact val , for every value in \u00ce in the VAF, and for every audience. Thus in Figure 7 , someone can be persuaded of (A) since it is acceptable under any value order for which fact life. We will continue to refer to arguments in preferred extensions for all reasonable value orders (those which rate fact as the highest value) as objectively acceptable.",

The situation is shown in Figure 8 . This introduces a cycle which is single valued in that both arguments relate to fact. Now we can see that there are four possibilities for the status of an argument. Arguments may be objectively acceptable sceptically, if they appear in every preferred extension. They may be objectively acceptable credulously, if they appear in every preferred extension corresponding to some choice of facts: thus in the above example (A) is objectively acceptable on the assumption that (G). They may be subjectively acceptable sceptically if they appear in every preferred extension relating to some value order; in the above example (D) and (B) are subjectively acceptable however the conflict between (G) and (H) is resolved if life is preferred to property, and all of (A), (C) and (E) are acceptable whenever property is preferred to life. Finally they may be subjectively acceptable credulously if they appear in some preferred extension. All the arguments in Figure 8 fulfil this condition.",

Note that this abstracts away from the details of individual arguments: the assumption throughout is that the disputants agree as to what arguments should be considered, and as to which arguments attack other arguments. Persuasion is thus a matter of showing the critic that the argument under dispute must be accepted in any coherent position relating to this argument framework.

The disputants may agree on which arguments attack which other arguments, but differ as to which of these attacks succeed. They can differ because the success of the attack depends on the relative strengths of the arguments for an audience, which in turn relates to the values to which the arguments pertain. To handle this notion of value, I have introduced the notion of Value-based Argumentation Frameworks (VAF). For persuasion to be possible here, the argument must be in the preferred extension with respect to every AF derivable from the VAF by choosing an ordering on the values involved, a state of affairs which I termed objectively acceptable. For VAFs which contain no cycles in which all the arguments relate to the same value, the preferred extension given a value ordering is unique. This greatly simplifies the situation, since there is no difference between sceptical and credulous acceptance. The problem of determining whether an argument is objectively acceptable or not in such a framework can therefore be determined in time of order \u00d2 \u00a3 \u00d1where \u00d2 is the number of attacks and \u00d1 the number of value orderings. Remember that m is intended to be relatively small, since we envisage a limited number of values in any VAF -in many cases two will suffice.",

It may be that circumstances do not obtain; or it may be that performing in would not promote good .

Alternatively it can be attacked because performing some action , which would exclude , would also promote in . This is like an attack using an argument with a contradictory conclusion.

For example, when lawyers and legal educators discuss persuasion and persuasive arguments they appear, for the most part, to be interested only in the ideas of other lawyers and legal educators. Likewise, when journalists and journalism educators talk and write about persuasion and persuasive arguments, they seem convinced that no one other than someone trained or experienced in journalism could have anything worthwhile to say about the topics.

It argues that anyone who is interested in the process of persuasion-including \"editorialists, propagandists, advertisers, political campaigners, ministers, lawyers, courtiers, and seducers\"-can learn from anyone who is interested in the art of persuasion. The article includes five main parts. Part II, which follows this introduction, briefly describes ideas from the fields of law, communication theory, and argumentation theory that analyze the nature of persuasion and the structure of persuasive messages. Part III contains an elaborate discussion of the work of the informal logician, Stephen Toulmin. In particular, it considers Toulmin's model for persuasive arguments. Part IV of the paper explores ideas about argumentation and argument structure in the literature of cognitive psychology and com-puter science. Part V returns to one of the topics discussed briefly in Part III-\"rebuttals\"-and suggests that rebuttals, correctly done, can be tremendously potent argumentative devices. Part VI proposes a new model for persuasive arguments, a model that simultaneously builds on and modifies Toulmin's model.",

In addition, an argument can be something that people make (as in, \"The Dean presented her argument about faculty salaries to the Chancellor.\").

                "text": "Unfortunately, for purposes of the present work, a serious problem exists with much of this literature. Because argumentation theory deals with all facets of the process of persuasion, much of the literature in the field has little or nothing to do with the structure of persuasive arguments. Consider, for example, research regarding the personal characteristics of different kinds of audiences and the \"involvement\" of members of an audience in an issue. Virtually all argumentation theory researchers now think that different audiences respond differently to different types of arguments. 2 2 Likewise, researchers now largely agree that audiences that have \"high involvement\" with the issue being argued tend to be persuaded to different degrees, and in different ways, than people who have \"low involvement\" with the issue. 2 1 Similarly, research about the connection between the persuasiveness of an argument and the credibility of the source of the argument demonstrates that credible people are more persuasive than non-credible people. 2 4 Other researchers who have focused on persuasiveness as a gender function have concluded that the gender of audiences and persuaders may play a role in persuasiveness. 25 While surely these analyses are useful in their own spheres, they do not bear on the structure of persuasive arguments. At least some work in argumentation theory, however, including some rather general treatments, does deal with ideas related to the structure of persuasive arguments. 2 6 This is the work that is of most interest here. Some researchers, for example, have studied the way that individual arguments are \"chained\" together to create a total argument. of a persuasive argument and can quickly reveal when some crucial piece is missing. Furthermore, other researchers have compared the relative persuasiveness of organized versus disorganized arguments. 28 These researchers have discovered, among other things, that audiences tend to think that people who make organized arguments are more credible than people who make disorganized arguments. Also, as noted above, credible people tend to be more persuasive than noncredible people. 29 Research on the differences between organized and disorganized arguments has also revealed that audiences tend to have certain relatively dear expectations regarding the organization or structure of arguments. Thus, researchers in this field now think that audiences react more favorably to arguments that are organized in familiar forms than to arguments that are organized in unfamiliar forms.",

Other researchers think that a \"recency\" effect exists: arguments that appear at the end of a message are more persuasive than those made earlier. 3 3 Another group of argumentation theorists has produced a mixed bag of evidence regarding the effect, if any, of the total number of arguments in a message and the effect, if any, of the repetition of arguments within a message. 3 4 Some of these researchers believe that in certain circumstances several component arguments are better than a single argument. Repetition of similar arguments may No. 1] also be more persuasive than a single presentation. 5 Two other specific branches of argumentation research must also be mentioned briefly. First, some argumentation researchers study the differences, if any, between \"one-sided\" and \"two-sided\" arguments. 3 6 In one-sided arguments, proponents put forward only their own points. Conversely, in two-sided arguments, proponents put forward their own points and then also describe some of their opponents' points. Most researchers in this field believe that highly educated people tend to be persuaded more by two-sided arguments than by one-sided arguments. Second, a number of people who have studied the way that persuasive arguments are organized believe that arguments should begin with some kind of reference to the issue or the problem being addressed. For this reason, two key forms of argument, the \"problem-solution\" and \"motivated sequence\" models, both begin with a statement of the problem or the issue.

He believes, for example,'that universal principles cannot be used alone to judge arguments. 4 4 Rather, a whole different system of judging must be used. 4 5 Some parts of all arguments, Toulmin thinks, can only be judged pursuant to criteria that change from one field of inquiry to another. Toulmin calls these parts of arguments \"field dependent.\" 4 6 Conversely, Toulmin acknowledges that one can judge some parts of arguments, namely parts having to do with what he calls the \"force\" or intensity of the argument, using factors that do not vary from one field of inquiry to another. Toulmin calls these parts \"field invariant. 47 An example best illustrates Toulmin's classification system in operation. Consider these two arguments: \"George Bush un-39. See ToULMIN ET AL., supra note 17. 40. See, e.g., Richard Fulkerson, Technical Logic, Comp-Logk, and questionably is a better president than Ronald Reagan,\" and \"Michael Jordan unquestionably is a better basketball player than Larry Bird.\" Since political and statesmanship skills are wildly different from basketball skills, the criteria that must be used to judge these two different arguments are wildly different. Thus, the arguments are, at least in part, field dependent. At the same time, however, one aspect of both of these arguments is field invariant. In both of these arguments the word \"unquestionably\" means exactly the same thing.",

He believes that the structure of persuasive arguments is for the most part field invariant. 4 Thus, Toulmin explains that even if the subject matter of arguments differs wildly, and even if arguments are made in completely different fields of inquiry, the structure of the arguments should remain more or less the same. 4 9 That structure, in turn, consists of two groups of three parts each. The first group, the more important group, includes parts that Toulmin calls \"grounds,\" \"claims,\" and \"warrants.\" 5 0 The second group includes parts that Toulmin calls \"backing,\" \"qualifiers,\" and \"rebuttals. ' 1 \"Grounds,\" which roughly correspond in Toulmin's thinking to the minor premise in a classical syllogism, essentially are any data, observations, personal opinions or factual materials relevant to an issue being considered. Grounds, in other words, are the factual evidence in a particular situation. For example, if the facts of a situation are such that a person left his car in a metered spot without putting money in the meter, then, using Toulmin's terminology, those facts would be grounds for an argument in law. Likewise, if the facts of a situation are such that a patient displays a virus-like pallor, lethargy, and low fever, those symptoms would be the grounds of an argument in the field of medicine. Finally, if the facts of a situation are such that a person has again and again chosen to work hard at publicly visible projects and has never followed through on jobs calling for a lot of invisible hard work, those facts are the grounds for an argument in the field of psychology. [Vol. 16 \"Claims,\" in Toulmin's terminology, are the conclusions that people making arguments wish audiences to accept. Claims, in other words, roughly correspond to the conclusion in a classical syllogism. In the legal problem just described, for example, the claim might be that the person who did not feed the meter is guilty of the offense. Likewise, in the medical problem, the claim might be that the patient is suffering from a viral infection. Finally, in the psychology problem, the claim might be that the person's appearance of hard work and conscientiousness is a pose. \"Warrants,\" which roughly correspond in the Toulmin system to the major premise in a classical syllogism, link the grounds to the claim. Warrants, in other words, explain why a claim is \"warranted.\" For example, in the foregoing parking meter example, the warrant used probably would be a rule of law stating that anyone who leaves a car in a metered space without putting money in the meter can be found guilty of a parking meter offense. Likewise, the warrant in the foregoing medical example probably would be the generally accepted medical principle that pallor, lethargy and low fever often mean viral or bacterial infection. Finally, the warrant in the psychology example could be the accepted notion in that field that someone who seeks to work only at what is rewarded is not conscientious.",

Unfortunately, Toulmin himself does not really explain why backing increases the persuasiveness of arguments. John Reinard, however, provides just such an explanation. 3 Reinard's own research and other research that he cites indicate that people who use \"evidence\" as part of their arguments-that is, people who refer to facts and information that they themselves did not produce-tend to be viewed by most audiences as more credible than people who do not use evidence. 5 4 Evidence, of course, is just a different name for backing. Credibility, in turn, is critical. As noted earlier, the credibility of the source of an argument is a major factor in determining the persuasiveness of the argument itself 5 Consider in this context a simple example. Assume that Professor Smith states at a faculty meeting that \"post-tenure\" review is a bad idea. This statement is, in Toulmin's terminology, a warrant. When questioned as to why this should be so, Smith responds: \"Because I think so!\" Now assume that Professor Jones states at that same faculty meeting that post-tenure review is a good idea. Again, this is a warrant. When questioned as to why, however, Jones responds that dozens of researchers at numerous higher education institutions have studied the issue of post-tenure review and have uniformly concluded that it is a good thing. BecauseJones provides evidence or backing for her warrant, whereas Smith provides none, Jones is a more credible persuader than Smith. Thus, at least in theory, Jones' argument should be more persuasive than Smith's. Jones, of course, may not actually persuade anyone at all on this point. But if she fails to persuade, it will not be because her argument itself is less persuasive than Smith's. Rather, she will fail for reasons earlier noted herein, perhaps reasons having to do with the \"audience\" for the argument she delivers and the level of \"involvement\" that the audience has in the issue being discussed. 6 \"Qualifiers,\" in Toulmin's thinking, are the elements of ar- ",

Qualifiers tend to reduce the amount of change in belief called for by an argument. Qualifiers also seem to make arguments more persuasive because many people, and particularly many educated people, seem to be more willing to accept somewhat tentative positions than they are to accept absolute positions.

Toulmin seems to thinkand in this he is joined by most of the researchers whose work is discussed above-that people create persuasive arguments through the use of only one kind of reasoning process. That reasoning process involves the application of some sort of general rule-a warrant, to use Toulmin's terminology-to particular factual incidents. Rule-based reasoning, which is what we can call the reasoning described by Toulmin and most persuasion researchers, surely plays a critical role in the creation of persuasive arguments.

We know it is simpler than rule-based reasoning because human beings, particularly small children, use case-based reasoning before they use rule-based reasoning. When a child is deciding whether to spread jelly on the cat, for example, that child is far more likely to remember the spanking she received the last time she did this than some general rule about jellyspreading.

Novice casebased reasoners (and inexpertly programmed machines) thinking about this problem would search for past cases that share surface factual characteristics with the present problem. Thus, novice reasoners dealing with this problem would search primarily for past cases involving granddaughters promised money by grandfathers. Or, if they expanded the scope of their searches somewhat, novice reasoners might look for past cases involving gift promises made by relatives. Because these novices would so limit their searches, however, they would be unlikely to find the case of the elderly woman. They would not find this case because its surface-factual characteristics are not similar to the surface-factual characteristics of the grandfather problem. Conversely, expert case-based reasoners dealing with the grandfather problem would do two things. First, they would create a schemata of the facts in the problem, perhaps a schemata indicating that the problem involves reliance by someone on a promise that is, for whatever reason, not generally enforceable in a court of law. Second, they would search for past cases that fit that schemata. These reasoners would then quickly find the elderly woman case because it involves reliance on a generally unenforceable promise.",

In the grandfather situation, for example, one could classify the facts as involving reliance. However, one also could classify them as involving an \"exchange.\" (For reasons that are not important here, the presence or absence of an exchange is important in American contract law.) 7 1 Yet, if the facts are classified differently-if different factual \"schemata\" are used-then different rules might be used. If different rules are used, then different results might be obtained. Furthermore, in many situations rules carry with them a whole slew of exceptions. Some of those exceptions are explicitly stated in the rules themselves. Some, however, are merely implicit. Finally, in many situations the terms and words used in rules are vague or ambiguous.

The policy behind the reliance rule might provide a definition of that word. Second, policy-based reasoning can provide a test for determining what one should and should not include in the factual schemata used to search for past cases that are structurally similar to present problems. In connection with the granddaughter problem, for example, the ruling in the past case involving the elderly woman might explicitly or implicitly indicate that the age and gender of the relying person in that case played no role in the result obtained. If this is so, then the factual schema used in connection with searches for past cases would not have to include references to the age or gender of relying promisees. Conversely, if the ruling in the past case indicated explicitly or implicitly that either or both of these matters were important, then the schema would have to include reference to one or both of them. Finally, one can use policybased reasoning to complement case-based and rule-based reasoning in the sense that it can simply provide additional support to an argument based on rules or past cases.

Second, the granddaughter would create a new warrant or policy that grows out of these distinguished facts and that produces opposite results in the past case and the present problem.

Thus, when the mistake was discovered in the present problem, the young woman possessed the jewel. In the past case, however, the young girl had turned over the diamond before the mistake was discovered. Thus, when the mistake was discovered in the past case, the jeweler possessed the jewel. If it is assumed that these possession facts are structural facts, then the woman's lawyer has distinguished the past case from the present problem. Second, the lawyer would use the factual difference just described to create a reconciling warrant (rule): \"Conflicts over ownership of mistakenly identified goods should be resolved so as to award ownership to the person in possession of the goods at the time when the mistake is discovered.\" When this warrant is applied to the facts of the counter example, the actual result in that past case is obtained-the jeweler wins.

Toulmin's model fails in part because it does not put sufficient emphasis on the role that rebuttals-either passive or active-can play, and it certainly does not put sufficient emphasis on the role that reconciling rebuttals can play. More generally, Toulmin's model also fails because it only describes rule-based reasoning, that is, the application of warrants to grounds in order to produce claims.

With the new model, one should use case-based and policy-based reasoning to supplement rulebased (warrant-based) reasoning. Second, although Toulmin's model calls for the use of rebuttals, rebuttals in his model play a relatively minor role. This article suggests, however, that rebuttals, particularly reconciling rebuttals, can play a crucial role in the overall persuasiveness of arguments. Thus, the new model explicitly calls for a reconciliation as part of the rebuttal. (See Figure 5 .)",

First, research suggests that experts differ from novices with respect to the amount of informational knowledge they possess. Experts tend to know a lot of information about their fields of expertise. Novices tend not to know very much information. To be sure, researchers do not think that anybody who possesses a lot of informational knowledge will be an expert. Nevertheless, most researchers agree that the absence of large amounts of knowledge makes expertise unlikely. Second, research suggests that experts do not necessarily differ from novices with regard to \"generic\" thinking skills. Experts, in other words, are not necessarily better than novices at inductive reasoning or deductive reasoning. Thus, novices cannot be turned into experts simply by instruction in generic thinking skills. Finally, and most sig- nificantly, research suggests that expert thinkers consciously or subconsciously use \"schemata,\" \"heuristics,\" or \"models\" in conjunction with their thinking activities, whereas novices do not. Just as an expert cook consciously or subconsciously uses a recipe in order to organize a mass of food materials, an expert thinker uses heuristics to organize a mass of informational knowledge. Novice cooks and novice thinkers, however, do not know the recipes or heuristics, or, if they know them, do not know how to use them.",

This article does not attempt to explain the exhaustive intricacies of the process of creating persuasive messages. Rather, its two-fold goal is more limited. First, by linking up different bodies of knowledge that have heretofore been more or less separate, this article increases the overall store of informational knowledge available to anybody, in whatever field, who writes and thinks about the structure of persuasive arguments. In doing this, the article suggests a number of new directions for thought and research. Currently, for example, persuasion researchers have not compared the relative persuasiveness of messages that use rule-based, case-based, or policybased reasoning, or various combinations of the different kinds of reasoning. The work of cognitive and computer scientists, however, suggests that such persuasion research is long overdue. Likewise, the work of persuasion researchers suggests that cognitive and computer scientists have a great deal to learn about the process of persuasion itself. Second, this article provides explicit pictures of several heuristics or models, including the Toulmin Plus model, that expert persuaders might subconsciously use when they create persuasive messages. Experts themselves can use these pictures both to improve their own work and, more significantly, to train novices.",

First, it is clear that when unprepared students are called on in a class, other students are discouraged and teachers are annoyed. Because Jones's rule makes it so terribly costly for students to respond in class when they are unprepared, they almost never do this. Thus, the problems of student discouragement and teacher annoyance almost never occur. Second, because this rule simultaneously sets a realistic standard regarding student classroom preparation and creates a draconian penalty for failure to comply with its simple requirements, it almost completely eliminates problems with the \"take-a-chance\" attitude that so many unprepared students normally bring with them to class. In Jones's class, no unprepared student takes a chance of being called. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, Jones's rule eliminates another common student practice, a practice employed by fully prepared students rather than by unprepared students. This practice, which can be called \"folding,\" occurs when prepared students who are called on respond that they are unprepared simply because they do not wish to answer a particular question or simply because they do not have the energy to get involved in class discussion on a particular day. Jones's rule, of course, eliminates this practice entirely.",

All of these facts suggest that some kind of \"good faith\" exception should be attached to Jones's rule. To be sure, the rule itself makes no mention of such an exception.

Jones also told the class that ifJennifer does not call in on time, a severe penalty is imposed-no car for a week. Jones recently told the class that on a recent occasion Jennifer was out late on a Sunday night. When she checked a clock in a store window for the time-she had forgotten her watch-she saw that it was 12:30 a.m., certainly early enough to get home without calling.

First, as Toulmin and others repeatedly note,76  warrants that are accompanied by backing or authority tend to be more persuasive than warrants that stand alone. For that reason, warrants used with reconciliation rebuttals probably should themselves be accompanied by backing. In the shiny stone problem, for example, the young woman's lawyer should cite backing or authority for the possession warrant. Likewise, in the granddaughter problem, the granddaughter's lawyer should cite backing or authority for the dead promisor warrant. Second, reconciliation and rebuttals should come at the end of total arguments, or at least relatively near the end. In part, this is necessary because of the \"recency\" effect mentioned earlier.The recency effect suggests that the end of an overall message is a particularly good place to put a strong argument; reconciliations, if done well, can be extraordinarily potent. Reconciliation rebuttals should also appear relatively near the end of arguments because they tend to violate audience expectations. (As noted earlier, arguments that violate audience expectations tend to be more persuasive than arguments that follow standard form.) Audiences, after all, do not expect arguers to use counter examples to support original claims."

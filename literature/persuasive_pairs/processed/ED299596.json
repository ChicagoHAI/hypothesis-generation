    "abstract": "Existing evidence suggests that students do less well in writing argument than they do in writing narrative reports, and the reasons for the poorer performance are complex and interactive. In some ways argument is more cognitively demanding than narrative, but lack of experience in persuasive writing, and the interrelated nature of the writing situation and the assessment situation also play a role. A review of the literature reveals several lines of evidence which suggest that argumentative writing should not be neglected because it might be too difficult. Useful procedures for developing persuasive writing include the following: (1) topics should be cn issues important to students; (2) students should be encouraged ..o engage in persuasive writing to teachers, peers, principals, and others when they feel strongly on issues; (3) large and small group discussions are invaluable in developing associated skills; (4) exercises to sort out what the students think are an important bridge to argumentative writing; and (5) stuf.cnts in the upper elementary years and beyond should read persuasive writing for exposure to linguistic conventions. There is no good reason why this kind of writing should be regarded as a difficult form to be attempted only by older and brighter students. (Forty-seven references are attached.) (RS)",

A variety of terms is used for the kind--or kinds--of writing discussed in this chapter. Applebee (1984) , for example, uses the term thesis/support essay for that type of writing which has a hierarchical, analytic structure and which requires that arguments be systematically supported (p. 87); persuasive writing for him is that kind of writing \"where the attempt to persuade overrides all other purroses (as in advertisements or propaganda)\" (p. 14). Martin and Rothery (1980; 1981; 1986) use exposition for writing which has as its goal \"persuad(ing) the reader of the truth or 'rightness' of a proposition\" (1986, p. 72) and which 1s the structure: Thesis followed by a variable number of Arguments followed by Conclusion. The terms argumentative, persuasive, and argumentative/persuasive are used interchangeably both in descriptions of the IEA study (Connor et al., 1987) and in reports of the APU assessments in the United Kingdom (Gorman, White, Brooks, MacLure, A Kispal, 1988) .",

Topics widely and hotly debated in my region in the recent past have included the following: capital punishment (occasioned by a free vote in the federal parliament on the possible reintroduction of the death penalty); immigration policy (occasioned by the arrival off the coast of eastern Canada of a boat load of illegal immigrants); wolf kills authorized by the provincial government as a measure of wild-life management; whether or not the provincial government should pay for lunches for hungry school children and expensive drugs for AIDS victims."

Decision theoretic approaches construct prescriptive models of the negotiation process that make various assumptions about the behavior of the negotiation participants but do not model changes in behavior. On the other hand, models for decision support leave the actual decisions to human negotiators, again not modeling or automating the negotiating process. In contrast to both approaches, our work deals with automating the negotiation process. This paper focuses on modeling the process by which the beliefs and behavior of negotiators are changed via persuasive argumentation. We claim that persuasive argumentation lies at the heart of negotiation and embodies the dynamics of negotiation. We present a model of persuasive argumentation that integrates Artificial Intelligence and decision theoretic methods. The model has been implemented as part of the PERSUADER, a multi-agent computer program that operates in the domain of labor negotiations.",

The process incorporates intangibles such as the negotiators' skills and experience, the parties' values, beliefs, perceptions and behaviors. What makes the problem even more complex is the dynamic nature of negotiations. The interaction of the participants during negotiations engenders changes in their goals, the ways they perceive the issues, their utilities associated with various outcomes and their reservation prices. These changes are necessary for achievement of an agreed upon settlement. In our work, the process by which these changes are brought about is persuasive argumentation.",

                "text": "During negotiations, participants need to shift their positions (e.g., make concessions). Decision theoretic approaches (e.g., Rao and Shakun, 1974; Fogelman et al., 1983) formulate concession making as a sequential decision process where the next decision of a party depends on the current state, the magnitude of concession already made, and anticipated responses of the other party(ies). The solution process involves a search for change in the goals and constraints as well as a search for solutions satisfying a changing joint solution space (which initially may be empty). These models use the concept of subjective probability estimates supplied by the parties. Subjective probability estimates are supposed to incorporate informal information that becomes available during negotiations and was not taken into consideration in the model, and the 'feeling' that the parties have about the interactions. Researchers in decision sciences (e.g., Shakun, 1988; Rao and Shakun, 1974; Kersten, 1985) have recognized the need for behavioral mechanisms that underlie the process of changing perceptions, goals and constraints which in turn underlie the process of concession making. Our work presents a model of the process, persuasive argumentation, and mechanisms that are used by the parties to effect these changes. Our model represents the belief structure of the parties in a symbolic form that is capable of being dynamically updated as a result of arguments.",

The information communicated is intended to 'convince' the recipient agent to shift his negotiating position so as to narrow the parties' differences to achieve final agreement. In a nutshell, the argumentation process can be described as follows: an agent reasons about another agent using his own model of that other agent, finds as many ways as the model will allow to affect the other agent's outcomes (behavior), and uses them selectively to influence the other agent.",

The PERSUADER, emulating the behavior of human mediators, negotiates with each of the disputants to arrive at a mutually satisfying settlement. The PERSUADER system consists of three agents: the union, the company and the mediator. The reasoning is done from the mediator's point of view. In negotiating with each of the two parties, the mediator is the persuader and the union or company the persuadee. Although the architecture of the PER-SUADER casts the mediator as persuader, the theory of argumentation and mechanisms for argument generation that we present apply independently of what agent is the persuader or the persuadee.",

A belief in the PERSUADER involves the correspondence between a state (a possible settlement) and the other agents' actions. Group knowledge (Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987) in the PERSUADER focuses on the facts of the case: proposals, counterproposals, negotiation context etc. If agreement on a compromise were obtainable by inference from these facts, negotiation would be unnecessary. Such is not the case, however, since the goals, plans and utilities of the agents are largely unknown and the evaluation function is distributed. The negotiation process itself is a search of a dynamic problem space where an agent's beliefs about other agents' beliefs and hence feasible solutions continuously changes the space being searched. What was not an acceptable solution at one point becomes a solution at a later point) This occurs as a consequence of the agents' realization of the inevitability of partial goal satisfaction through acceptance of a compromise. The PER-SUADER attempts to influence the process toward solution convergence by constructing arguments to being about belief states of the agents that are necessary in achieving states of agreed upon settlements (global system solutions).",

The final output is either a single plan in the form of an agreed upon settlement (contract) or an indication of failure if the parties to the dispute did not reach agreement within a particular number of proposals (to simulate the inability of parties in the real world to reach agreement before a strike deadline). A contract that is proposed by one agent to another is a plan that the proposing agent will follow, contingent on the second agent's agreement. Proposed contracts in the PERSUADER are subject to negotiation and possible modification. The negotiation process consists of iteration and interleaving of three main tasks: generation of a proposal, generation of a counterproposal based on feedback from a dissenting party, and persuasive argumentation. The mediator generates an initial compromise proposal and presents it to both the union and company who evaluate the proposal from their perspectives and give the mediator their reaction. If both accept the proposal, then it is the final compromise. If one of the agents rejects it, the mediator enters a negotiation with that party and makes a decision whether to change the proposal or attempt to change the disagreeing party's position by persuasive arguments.",

Examples of minor standards include steadiness of employment and hazardous work (Elkouri and Elkouri, 1973 ). An example appealing to a \"minor standard\" that a mediator can use to convince management to grant higher increases than warranted by prevailing practice is: \"The working conditions of this fire department leave something to be desired because the department is undermanned causing a potential safety hazard. This is not the situation in other communities. So, higher wage increases are justified\".

For example, a local union might insist that the company accept a particular seniority clause claiming that it is the standard clause demanded by the international union. If the company can produce a contract signed by another local of the same international that has a different seniority clause, the company can argue that the union's claim is untenable.

The effectiveness of a threat (promise) hinges on the power of the persuader to control the contingencies mentioned in the threat (promise). A threat (promise) is selfjustified and does not need any extra justification. Because people want to satisfy their goals, threatening an important goal of a persuadee is the most effective of arguments. In labormanagement disputes, the threat of a strike is the most frequently used and clearly the most powerful argument. However, there are other threats that can be very persuasive, as when a foodprocessing company's employees threaten to \"leak\" news of health violations at the plant. The mediator's role here is to convince the company that the employees will carry out their threat and that similar tactics have damaged recalcitrant companies in the past.",

The effect of threats and promises is the abandonment of some goal on the part of the persuadee leaving his belief structure intact. When the threat of a mugger makes John relinquish his wallet (abandoning the less important goal of preserving his money to safeguard the more important goal of preserving his life), John's beliefs about the importance of money, life and other related goals does not change, although the threat has affected his behavior. When the promise of being taken to a muppet show convinces little Billy to change his behavior and eat his spinach (abandoning the less important goal of annoying his parents by not eating in order to fulfill the more important goal of seeing the muppets), his behavior changes but his beliefs about spinach, annoying his parents and muppets do not.",

In the utility theory formulation, this can be translated as \"payoff(20)= LOW\" (i.e., the satisfaction that the company would derive if it were to give a wage increase of 20 cents per hour would be some low value). In the company's belief structure, this assessment of the company is represented as WAGES(+, A < 20 cents) 4 (i.e. the company's goal is to give a wage increase of at most some amount less than 20 cents). Convincing the company that this increase is not so high changes its wage goal to WAGES(+, A = 20 cents).

The mediator, in the above example, could use the first argumentation strategy, if he finds evidence that in the past the company has always given big wage increases.

The goals are organized as in the example goal graphs for the union and company depicted in Figures 1 and 3 . Importance of goals is expressed on a 0 to 10 scale. By examining the company's goal graph, depicted in Figure 4 one observes that since an increase in fringes contributes to an increase in economic concessions, labor costs and production costs, and a decrease in company profits, one of the company's goals is to decrease fringes. The subgoal of decreasing employment contributes to a decrease in economic concessions, labor costs and production costs. Decreasing employment violates the goal of a union of increased employment. This can be checked by examining the union's belief structure. The argument, addressed to a union that has refused a proposed increase in fringes, \"If the company is forced to grant higher increases in fringes, then it will decrease employment\" is meant to make the union abandon the goal of further increases in fringes by pointing out unpleasant consequences for the union of forcing the company to give an increase it cannot afford.",

WAGES(-) is considered as a possible action of the company to offset the increase in economic concessions. Thus, a possible argument might be: \"If the company is forced to grant higher fringes, it will reduce the granted wages\". Generating this argument depends on whether the company can reduce the wages. Assuming that the wages were not under negotiation in this case, the argument is rejected and the search continues from ECONOMIC-CONCESSIONS(+). LABOR-COST(+) is reached, whose child, EMPLOYMENT(-) is controllable by the company and conflicts with the union goal EMPLOYMENT(+). Assuming EMPLOYMENT(+) is more important for the union than an increase in fringe benefits, the argument \"If the company is forced to grant higher fringe benefits, then it will lay off workers\" is generated.",

These arguments take the form of threats to break off negotiations if the party does not accept the current proposal. Breakoff arguments assert that the cost of breaking off negotiations is greater than the loss in payoff associated with the current (unacceptable to the persuadee) proposed settlement. The effectiveness of these arguments reflects actual labor negotiations (e.g., Herman and Kuhn, 1981) where it is observed that as the strike deadline approaches, and as the parties calculate the costs of a strike against the possible worth of a settlement, their willingness to compromise increases, or equivalently, the payoff required for agreement decreases.",

In other words, it is assumed that a party will accept a proposed settlement if it gives payoff (equal and/or) higher than 70%. The loss in payoff is the difference between 70% and the payoff of the current (rejected by the persuadee) proposal. The loss in payoff also represents the amount by which the reservation price of the rejecting party needs to be changed so that the party will agree to the proposed settlement. In the current implementation, it is assumed that loss of payoff is proportional to the party's breakoff costs. In other words, the greater the negotiation breakoff cost, the greater the payoff loss the party can tolerate (the less the needed payoff of an acceptable proposal). To calculate strike costs for the union and the company, the factors taken into consideration include: the inventory situation of the company, the economic conditions in the industry, outstanding orders, the condition of the union's treasury, unemployment in the job classifications of the bargain unit and the strike history of the union. For a target reservation price change, the PERSUADER calculates breakoff cost and checks to see whether the cost is greater than the targeted change. If it is, this calculation forms the basis for a negotiation breakoff argument. If not, the PER-SUADER seeks to see what assumptions would increase the breakoff cost and the breakoff arguments include these assumptions.

In such domains a persuader has to convince the rejecting party that negotiations will not be resumed for as long a time as is needed for the negotiation breakoff cost to yield the appropriate satisfaction drop. In the PERSUADER this length of time is looked up from the curve of strike cost vs time for the rejecting party. This curve is approximated by accessing experiences with similar parties. The shape of a company's curve depends on the kind of product the company produces. For example, if the grape pickers go on strike at the time the grapes are ripe, there is an initial period of a few days where the strike cost rises linearly with time (assuming the strike started just before the optimal picking time). After the grapes are overripe, the strike cost drops to zero. For the union, the curve of strike cost vs time depends on the shape the union's strike fund is in, the level of unemployment for the skills of the union members, and the level of unemployment benefits. To strengthen a negotiation breakoff argument, a persuader mediator can use retrieved cases where a breakoff had an adverse effect for a similar persuadee.",

In politics, a candidate (or his campaign manager) is familiar with various arguments pertaining to issues at hand. In such cases, the persuader can retrieve an argument appropriate to a situation instead of having to construct one from scratch. One question that has to be addressed is how the retrieval process can be guided so that the persuader will retrieve the most appropriate argument from a potentially large number of arguments pertaining to an issue.

The most important knowledge source for argument generation is a model of the persuadee's belief and preference structure. We have shown how this model can be used to produce persuasive arguments to change a persuadee's beliefs and behavior. We have presented a model of persuasive argumentation and strategies for argument generation. Construction of arguments is performed using integration of Case-Based Reasoning, graph search and approximate estimation of agents' utilities.

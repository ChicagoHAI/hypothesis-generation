Hancock"],"year": 2011, "abstract": "Consumers increasingly rate, review and research products online. Consequently, websites containing consumer reviews are becoming targets of opinion spam. While recent work has focused primarily on manually identifiable instances of opinion spam, in this work we study deceptive opinion spam---fictitious opinions that have been deliberately written to sound authentic. Integrating work from psychology and computational linguistics, we develop and compare three approaches to detecting deceptive opinion spam, and ultimately develop a classifier that is nearly 90% accurate on our gold-standard opinion spam dataset. Based on feature analysis of our learned models, we additionally make several theoretical contributions, including revealing a relationship between deceptive opinions and imaginative writing."}

Although machine learning models can sometimes achieve impressive performance in these tasks, these tasks are not amenable to full automation. To realize the potential of machine learning for improving human decisions, it is important to understand how assistance from machine learning models affects human performance and human agency. \nIn this paper, we use deception detection as a testbed and investigate how we can harness explanations and predictions of machine learning models to improve human performance while retaining human agency. We propose a spectrum between full human agency and full automation, and develop varying levels of machine assistance along the spectrum that gradually increase the influence of machine predictions. We find that without showing predicted labels, explanations alone slightly improve human performance in the end task. In comparison, human performance is greatly improved by showing predicted labels (>20% relative improvement) and can be further improved by explicitly suggesting strong machine performance. Interestingly, when predicted labels are shown, explanations of machine predictions induce a similar level of accuracy as an explicit statement of strong machine performance. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between human performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predictions can moderate this tradeoff."}

While existing approaches focus on explaining machine predictions with real-time assistance, we explore model-driven tutorials to help humans understand these patterns in a training phase. We consider both tutorials with guidelines from scientific papers, analogous to current practices of science communication, and automatically selected examples from training data with explanations. We use deceptive review detection as a testbed and conduct large-scale, randomized human-subject experiments to examine the effectiveness of such tutorials. We find that tutorials indeed improve human performance, with and without real-time assistance. In particular, although deep learning provides superior predictive performance than simple models, tutorials and explanations from simple models are more useful to humans. Our work suggests future directions for human-centered tutorials and explanations towards a synergy between humans and AI."}

And whereas past work has focused on identifying individual fake reviews, this paper aims to identify offerings (e.g., hotels) that contain fake reviews. We introduce a semi-supervised manifold ranking algorithm for this task, which relies on a small set of labeled individual reviews for training. Then, in the absence of gold standard labels (at an offering level), we introduce a novel evaluation procedure that ranks artificial instances of real offerings, where each artificial offering contains a known number of injected deceptive reviews. Experiments on a novel dataset of hotel reviews show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-art learning baselines."}
{"file_name": "Deceptiondetection.pdf", "title": "Deception Detection", "authors": ["Pär Anders Granhag", "Aldert Vrij"], "year": 2005, "abstract": "Many people are fascinated by deception. Grand liars often become famous (eg, Nick Leeson, who destroyed the 200-year-old Barings Bank), and a lie told by an already-famous person is often considered grand (eg, Bill Clinton lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky). Books with covers that promise some easy tricks to reveal liars may sell well, although the cover promises more than the authors can deliver. This general interest in deception is mirrored in the field of psychology and law, and intense research efforts over recent years have resulted in an impressive corpus of knowledge on deception and its detection (for recent overviews, see Granhag & Strömwall, 2004a; Vrij, 2000a). In this chapter we examine some of the latest research findings and explore what scientific psychology can tell us about the detection of deception. We focus mainly on research that has been conducted within the framework of “psychology and law” and pay less attention to related topics, such as deception in everyday life (DePaulo, Kashy, Kirkendol, Wyer, & Epstein, 1996), and deception in close relations (DePaulo & Bell, 1996). The study of deception spans many of psychology’s subdisciplines. For example, to understand why a liar’s internal states might translate into certain nonverbal behaviors, it is necessary to study emotion and physiological psychology; to be able to argue why the verbal content of a true statement might differ from a false statement, we must study memory; in order to explain why people with a certain facial appearance are judged as liars more often than others, we must study social psychology. The full list is much longer, but the point is …"}

Accordingly, there has been growing concern about the potential for posting deceptive opinion spam - fictitious reviews that have been deliberately written to sound authentic, to deceive the reader. In this paper, we explore generalized approaches for identifying online deceptive opinion spam based on a new gold standard dataset, which is comprised of data from three different domains (i.e. Hotel, Restaurant, Doctor), each of which contains three types of reviews, i.e. customer generated truthful reviews, Turker generated deceptive reviews and employee (domain-expert) generated deceptive reviews. Our approach tries to capture the general difference of language usage between deceptive and truthful reviews, which we hope will help customers when making purchase decisions and review portal operators, such as TripAdvisor or Yelp, investigate possible fraudulent activity on their sites."}

Karunananda"], "year": 2019, "abstract": "Consumer reviews are considered to be of utmost significance in the field of e-commerce, for they have a stronghold in deciding the revenue of a business. When arriving at a purchasing decision, a majority of online consumers rely on reviews since they offer credible means of mining opinions of other consumers regarding a particular product. The trustworthiness of online reviews directly affects a company’s reputation and profitability, which is why certain business owners pay fraudsters to generate deceptive reviews. Such generation of deceptive reviews which manipulate the purchasing decision of consumers is a persistent and harmful issue. Hence, developing methods to assist businesses and consumers by distinguishing between credible reviews and deceptive reviews remains to be a crucial, yet challenging task. In view of that, this paper unravels prominent techniques that have been proposed to solve the issue of deceptive review detection. Accordingly, the primary goal of this paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of current research on detecting deceptive reviews and to identify the characteristics, strengths, and bottlenecks of those methodologies which may need further improvements."}

Customers can write their opinions in reviews to express the value and quality of purchased goods and services. These opinions are used to make purchase decisions by customers and design market strategies by sellers. The trustiness of online reviews highly affects a company’s reputation and economic benefit. That is why online sellers hire people to write deceptive opinions to recommend their products or defame competitors’ products. Detecting deceptive opinion spam has emerged as a challenging task. The article describes the publicly available review datasets and explores their deficiencies in finding deceptive opinion spam. This literature systematically unwinds prominent features and approaches that have been introduced to extricate the problem of deceptive opinion spam detection. Our primordial objective is to confer a solemnity analysis of recent papers on deceptive opinion spam detection that describes methodologies’ features, strengths, and constraints. Finally, this work presents some crucial challenges and shortcomings of existing methodologies and introduces promising directions for further works. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent research in deceptive opinion spam detection, which may prove helpful to researchers’ best knowledge."}

A linguistic analysis perspective", "authors": ["Wen Zhang", "Qiang Wang", "Jian Li", "Zhenzhong Ma", "Gokul Bhandari", "Rui Peng"], "year": 2023, "abstract": "With the rapid development of e-commerce, online reviews have become an important information source for consumers and e-commerce businesses. While the negative impact of deceptive online reviews has been well recognized, more research has to be done to help understand the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews in order to help identify deceptive reviews and help increase the value and sustainability of e-commerce businesses. This study explores the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews based on the reality monitoring theory, and then uses the data from Amazon.com online product reviews to examine perceptual cues, affective cues, detail cues, relevance cues, and cognitive cues of various deceptive online reviews. The results show that reviews for emotional catharsis are more extreme with affective cues, while perfunctory reviews often lack details with fewer prepositions and adjectives. In addition, deceptive reviews often lack relevance cues when these reviews are made to obtain the rewards provided by the vendors while paid posters tend to use more cognitive cues in deceptive reviews. Moreover, deceptive online reviews under all motives often lack perceptual cues. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews and provide significant managerial implications for e-commerce businesses to employ high-quality online reviews for sustainable growth."}

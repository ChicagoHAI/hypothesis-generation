While the negative impact of deceptive online reviews has been well recognized, more research has to be done to help understand the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews in order to help identify deceptive reviews and help increase the value and sustainability of e-commerce businesses. This study explores the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews based on the reality monitoring theory, and then uses the data from Amazon.com online product reviews to examine perceptual cues, affective cues, detail cues, relevance cues, and cognitive cues of various deceptive online reviews. The results show that reviews for emotional catharsis are more extreme with affective cues, while perfunctory reviews often lack details with fewer prepositions and adjectives. In addition, deceptive reviews often lack relevance cues when these reviews are made to obtain the rewards provided by the vendors while paid posters tend to use more cognitive cues in deceptive reviews. Moreover, deceptive online reviews under all motives often lack perceptual cues. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews and provide significant managerial implications for e-commerce businesses to employ high-quality online reviews for sustainable growth.",

For consumers, online reviews can provide valuable information for purchase decisions (Lei et al. 2021; Li et al. 2019) . For e-commerce businesses, online reviews can help better understand consumers' concerns to improve products or services (Anderson and Simester, 2014; Q. Wang et al. 2022a Q. Wang et al. , 2022b)) . As a result, online reviews have become an important information source for consumers and e-commerce businesses (Lamb et al. 2020; Zuo et al. 2022) . According to a public survey, 92% of consumers actually use online reviews as references in their online shopping, and 90% of these consumers say that positive reviews make them more likely to use a product in purchase decisions (Zhang et al. 2022) .",

Here, deceptive online reviews are online reviews that are inconsistent with a true evaluation of the product or service (Wu et al. 2020 ). These deceptive reviews often lead to bad online shopping experiences (Jaziri, 2019; Lamb et al. 2020) , cause economic loss to online consumers, and consequently damage the reputation of involved businesses and further the platform economy as a whole (Zhuang et al. 2018) . For instance, the Daily Mail investigation found that rogue firms are selling deceptive reviews on Amazon.com to online retailers which put millions of Amazon.com consumers at risk with potential bad purchase decisions. As deceptive online reviews emerge as a pervasive issue in today's platform economy, the study of deceptive reviews has attracted increasing attention from industry and academia.",

Many studies have confirmed that the underlying causes for manipulating online reviews are either vendororiented for financial gains and competitive advantage or consumer-oriented such as for the release of emotion (Wu et al. 2020) , self-promoted brand management (Salehi-Esfahani and Ozturk, 2018) , or social status enhancing (Anderson and Simester, 2014) . At the same time, more research is designed to identify deceptive online reviews and a series of computing techniques have been developed to detect deceptive online reviews by combining natural language processing and machine learning (Kumar et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018) . This line of research contends that since deceptive online reviews are manufactured by reviewers with fictitious opinions deliberately written for their purposes, deceptive reviews may contain inconsistency in language compared with genuine reviews that are based on real experiences (Banerjee and Chua, 2017; Chatterjee et al. 2021; Gentina et al. 2021) .",

Understanding the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews is crucial for e-commerce stakeholders. For consumers, it helps create a clearer profile of deceptive online reviews. Consumers could write authentic reviews with high credibility, rather than being perceived as fraudulent reviewers because they may accidentally use the linguistic features of deceptive reviews. For platform enterprises, they could use review tips to guide consumers to post credible online reviews based on the knowledge of the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews. Moreover, platform businesses can differentiate the reviews with different motivations and thus conduct more strict scrutiny on the reviews with the possibly more harmful motivation of fraudulent promulgators to improve their e-commerce ecosystems (Mayzlin et al. 2014 ). In addition, some studies have argued that the linguistic characteristics of deceptive online reviews may vary depending on the underlying motives (Wu, 2019; Wu et al. 2020) . Thus, to understand this pervasive issue and gain deeper insight into the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews, this paper intends to examine two important research questions: (1) what are the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews?",

First, we develop a series of hypotheses on the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews with different motives based on the reality monitoring theory. Second, we collect the deceptive online reviews and extract their linguistic manifestations using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool (Chung and Pennebaker, 2011) . The linguistic manifestation includes linguistic characteristics and psychological characteristics. Third, negative binomial regression is adopted to analyze the specific linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews whereby the significant differences in linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews are identified. Within the context of the platform economy, this study is the first few of its kind to explore linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews (Chatterjee et al. 2021; Plotkina et al. 2020; Zhuang et al. 2018) . The results of this study will be able to shed light on a better understanding of deceptive online reviews and provide important insights to help improve the practice of online review management in e-commerce businesses.",

The commercial value embodied in online reviews comes with a fast emergence of deceptive online reviews in the era of the platform economy (Barbado et al. 2019; Chatterjee et al. 2021; Plotkina et al. 2020) . In general, there is a dearth of frameworks for deceptive online review motives in the e-commerce context. The existing work on deceptive online reviews has examined the motivational antecedents of deceptive reviews (Hussain et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2020) . Generally speaking, the motivation of deceptive online reviews can be divided into external motivation and internal motivation (Hussain et al. 2018) . Deceptive reviews induced by external motivation refer to the manipulation of online reviews by vendors for pecuniary motivation, and these deceptive reviews are often posted by paid posters (Kumar et al. 2019) for financial benefits or competitive advantage (Lee et al. 2018) . Here, paid posters refer to deceptive reviewers who are paid by the vendors to post fake online reviews according to the vendors' preferences (Ananthakrishnan et al. 2020 ). In the increasingly competitive market environment, more e-commerce businesses are worried that other businesses will manipulate online reviews (G\u00f6ssling et al. 2018) .",

The reward mechanism is an important motivation for consumers to post reviews (Qiao et al. 2020; Yu et al. 2022) . A consumer survey shows that financial rewards drive consumers to post more deceptive online reviews (Wu et al. 2020) . As far as psychological needs are concerned, Anderson and Simester (2014) contend that sometimes deceptive online reviews are posted to satisfy consumers' non-monetary needs such as respect from the group or the release of anger resulting from bad experiences. Online users sometimes create multiple virtual identities to post deceptive online reviews or use fake identities to post misleading information in virtual communities to gain attention from others (Wang et al. 2019) . Previous studies proposed that the need for social interaction, the desire for economic incentives, and advice-seeking were significant motivators for consumers to write online reviews (Kapoor et al. 2021; Vana and Lambrecht, 2021) . The studies on electronic word-of-mouth communication in social media further argued that consumers engaged in writing online reviews for different purposes, such as product involvement, information involvement, or self-involvement (H. Wang et al. 2022a Wang et al. , 2022b)) .",

Many scholars employ this theory to examine online reviews and classify the motivations for posting online reviews into four categories (\u00d6\u011f\u00fcta and Cezara, 2012) , including the motive for product involvement, the motive for information involvement, the motive for self-involvement, and the motive for other involvement. More specifically, the motive for product involvement refers to a consumer's desire to post online reviews based on their direct product experiences, often extreme experiences. Considering that this motive provides a channel for stress and frustration release when consumers have an extremely positive or negative experience in online shopping (Allard et al. 2020) , we call this motive as emotional catharsis in writing deceptive online reviews in this study, which means that reviewers are influenced by extreme product experiences and thus often post deceptive online reviews for the purpose of emotional catharsis.",

The motive for financial incentives in writing deceptive reviews is related to the information involvement motivation, and it refers to consumers' motive to post deceptive reviews as one way of information spreading to receive rewards from online vendors. The motive for self-involvement or self-enhancement refers to reviewers' psychological needs to gain attention or respect from others to improve their image among the group (Ke et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2019) . Driven by these psychological needs, consumers could demonstrate conformity behaviors by posting online reviews to gain attention for themselves but giving no sensible information or valuable advice on target products or services (Tunc et al. 2021) , and these reviews are often perfunctory and deceptive. In this regard, a perfunctory response is one motive in writing online reviews due to self-involvement motivation, and it implies that reviewers post useless or deceptive reviews as they see online reviews are meaningless but to gain attention. This type of motive is called perfunctory response in this study.",

Thus, we call this motive as paid posters, which refer to online vendors' efforts to gain competitive advantages and promote product sales by hiring paid posters. Altogether, this study proposes four motives for deceptive online reviews, including emotional catharsis, perfunctory response, financial incentives, and paid posters for deceptive reviews to examine their linguistic manifestation.

                "text": "Reality monitoring theory. The reality monitoring theory is developed from cognitive psychological research on human memory, and it argues that there is a qualitative difference between the memory of real events and the memory of imaginary events (Mac Giolla et al. 2019) . The memory of real events is obtained through the perceptual process, so it has three main characteristics: perceptual information (i.e., hear, sight, taste, smell, and touch), spatial details, and temporal details. In contrast, the memory of virtual events is derived from internal cognitive resources and thus has more cognitive operations information, such as thinking and inference. Therefore, the memory of real events has a different manifestation than that of the memory of imaginary events. Sporer (1997) defined eight criteria for identifying deceptive language based on the reality monitoring theory, including clarity, sensory information, spatial information, time information, affective information, constructability of the story, realism, and cognitive operation. Among them, clarity and constructability are rarely used by researchers in empirical studies. Specifically, clarity denotes that the language used is vivid, and constructability refers to the language using dialogue and scene setting to highlight important information about the event. These two criteria are usually used in story descriptions, but online reviews contain information about consumers' objective descriptions of products or services. Therefore, these two criteria are not suitable for the study of linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews. Sensory information contains visual information, audio information, and sensory information, and this set of information represents perceptual cues. Spatial information contains information about places or the spatial location of people. Time information contains cues about the occurrence time of an event or a clear description of the order in which the event occurs. Both spatial information and time information represent detail cues in language. In addition, affective information contains information about a person's feelings about an event. Realism means the statements are reliable, reasonable, and relevant. Cognitive operation means that the statement contains a description of a person's thinking and inference. Affective information, realism, and cognitive operation represent affective cues, relevance cues, and cognitive cues respectively in human language. In this study, we use perceptual cues, detail cues, affective cues, relevance cues, and cognitive cues to explore the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews under different motives.",

Emotional consumers may post unreal or biased reviews to vent their emotions because of emotional catharsis. When consumers are satisfied with the purchased products, they may post exaggerated positive reviews to express their shopping experiences. Thus, this type of online review would overpraise the products. Conversely, when consumers feel that the purchased product is bad, they may post excessively negative reviews to express their dissatisfaction. In addition, consumers may also give unrealistically low ratings because online vendors fail to meet certain requirements, such as gift-giving or promised cashback. Therefore, under the motive of emotional catharsis, consumers often post reviews that do not contain an evaluation of the quality of goods and services but are simply emotional expressions that only reveal their level of satisfaction with the goods or services. There are two kinds of emotions expressed under emotional catharsis: positive emotional expressions that overly praise the product and service and negative emotion expressions that vent their dissatisfaction, which both lead to extremely emotional online reviews.",

Researchers have reached a consensus that deceptive language contains more affective cues (Kumar et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2022) . Moreover, fraudulent reviewers are more likely to use positive and negative emotional expressions than people who post truthful reviews, and positive or negative affective words are used more in deceptive reviews to mislead consumers (Li et al. 2020) . Other studies have also obtained a similar finding on the positive relationship between affective cues and deceptive reviews. For instance, interpersonal deception theory explains the characteristics of deceptive language, suggesting that affective information is positively related to deceptive language (Petrescu et al. 2023) . Scientific content analysis technology develops standards for detecting deceptive language in ten aspects such as pronoun use, word changes, and emotional description (Mac Giolla et al. 2019) , and further points out that deceptive language is abundant with affective information. For example, Zhang et al. (2016) report that there are significant differences in affective clues between truthful and deceptive reviews. We admit that deceptive reviewers who seek emotional catharsis through online reviews may also use objective language to describe their experiences and the authentic reviewers may also use emotional words to describe their feelings (as suggested by one of the anonymous reviewers). However, compared with deceptive reviewers, authentic reviewers are more prone to use objective language to describe the product quality than to use emotional catharsis to describe their feelings.",

By drawing upon this existing knowledge, we posit that deceptive reviews under the motive of emotional catharsis are more likely to contain affective cues. Third, deceptive reviewers motivated by emotional catharsis may differ from other deceptive reviewers in their underlying motives. While some deceptive reviewers write to deceive potential consumers or to gain financial incentives, those seeking emotional catharsis may prioritize self-expression and emotional release.

Sometimes they may plagiarize these words to meet the review word count requirements set by online vendors, which can be considered as the reviewer's self-image and self-relationship protection behavior.

Other researchers point out that the contents of deceptive language would contain fewer adjectives, prepositions, and comparative words (Ho and Hancock, 2019) , and online reviews with this simple structure would most likely be deceptive ones (Shan et al. 2021) . Furthermore, the lying behavior pattern based on the interpersonal deception theory states that liars are more verbal, use fewer words and sentences, and liars are less likely to be negative in conversation to avoid being exposed to negative emotions (Yin et al. 2021) . Therefore, the general structure of the sentences used in deceptive reviews under the motive of perfunctory response tends to be quite simple, and the textual contents of the reviews may be less informative, leading to a lack of details in deceptive reviews.",

However, as reviewers are motivated by financial incentives and often boast their claimed product experiences with positive words, the content of review language often lacks a professional valence of products or even is irrelevant to products with little or no useful information for purchase reference. As a result, consumers usually use fewer honest, personal, and disclosing text in the virtual community to make the review sentences ambiguous, as has been found in the research on deceptive reviews (Zhang et al. 2016) .

Reviews created to obtain financial incentives often prioritize the achievement of monetary rewards over the provision of relevant and helpful information to potential consumers. In the case of financial incentives, reviewers may deliberately omit relevant product details and objective assessments to maximize their chances of obtaining incentives. Consequently, they may focus on fulfilling the minimum criteria necessary to qualify for the incentive, and write shorter, less detailed, and less relevant reviews. This strategic behavior aligns with the motive of financial incentives and contributes to the negative relationship between relevance cues and deceptive reviews under the motive of financial incentives. Therefore, the deceptive language under the financial incentives often lacks relevance cues.",

Along with the intensifying competition within the platform economy, self-boasting behaviors or malicious defamation among competitors have begun to widespread (Cao, 2020) . Some vendors could employ paid posters to make fake reviews to boost their stores' sales volume and improve their ranking to make profits and obtain competitive advantages. As a result, a large number of deceptive reviews could appear on various platforms. It is a widespread and growing phenomenon for online vendors to manipulate online product reviews by employing paid posters. These deceptive reviews posted by paid posters are usually unauthentic and exaggerated.

Fraudulent reviewers use more cognitive operations in deceptive reviews to make their arguments or statements appear more convincing, even though they have no purchase experience with the product at all. Therefore, language cues involving cognitive processes (such as \"cause\", \"know\", \"ought\" and \"think\") are more likely to be involved in deceptive language, and this information has been used as language clues for detecting deception in many studies (Kumar et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2022) . Deceptive reviews posted by paid posters contain more information about cognitive operations, including certainty words, insight words, causation words, and discrepancy words. Certainty words (i.e., always, never) show fraudulent praise and disparagement of a product or service. Insight words (i.e., think, know) are to mislead consumers by highlighting fraudulent opinions in reviews. Causation words (e.g., because, effect) are to support the reason for giving positive or negative reviews so that consumers would be more convinced. Discrepancy words (i.e., should, would) reveal the fake persuasion about why consumers should or should not purchase the product. Deceptive reviews posted by the paid posters are often derived from internal cognitive resources because they don't have real experiences with the product or service, and thus reviewers have to use more cognitive expressions to fabricate an imaginary story (Zhang et al. 2016) . Compared with authentic reviews, the deceptive reviews posted by paid posters contain more cognitive cues (Shan et al. 2021) . Specifically, deceptive reviews tend to have more cognitive information to deceive readers when vendors intend to promote their goods or defame competitors' reputations (Ansari and Gupta, 2021) .",

Under the motive of emotional catharsis, consumers merely express their satisfaction or dissatisfaction when consumers vent their emotions in a review, and they would not describe more perceptual details about the product or service (Q. Wang et al. 2022a Wang et al. , 2022b)) . Under the motive of perfunctory response, deceptive reviews tend to contain fewer perceptual process words (such as \"look\", \"heard\" and \"feel\") compared with truthful reviews (Zhang et al. 2022) . The deceptive reviews with a perfunctory response would contain less detailed information compared with other reviews, resulting in a lack of description of perceptual information. Under the financial incentives, reviewers would not express detailed perceptual expressions in reviews because of their exaggerated experiences of the reviewed product or service. It is thus hard to find perceptual information in reward-based deceptive reviews (Li et al. 2020) . The truthful reviews reflect the real after-use experience of consumers with the product or service, but the paid posters generally do not buy or experience the goods being reviewed and they can merely post reviews by imagination. These would also lead to less perceptual information in deceptive reviews (Kumar et al. 2019) .

Wang et 2022), including experience products (i.e., clothing, headphones) and search products (i.e., laptops, cell phones).

In the next three months, we tracked 12 product reviews reposted on the platform, which were reconsidered as truthful reviews and removed from our dataset of deceptive reviews. During the data collection period, we also collected the reviews that were not filtered out by Amazon.com and selected the top five reviews based on the voted helpfulness for each targeted product. The resulting 100 genuine reviews are used for the validation experiment (Section \"Validation of the results\"). In addition, deceptive reviews collected from the Amazon platform are all in English, and annotators were recruited from a public university in China to complete the annotation task. We use the translate-to-translate method to ensure the consistency of the Chinese and English reviews.

Following the step of the data annotation method (Jha and Shah, 2021) , we conducted a pre-annotation to determine the number of deceptive reviews in the annotation task before the formal annotation task. In the pre-annotation phase, we selected 30 consumers from a public university in China who had rich experience in posting online reviews to conduct the pre-annotation. The annotation time for each participant was recorded during the pre-annotation, and the mean value of annotation time for each review was 20 sec. According to the suggestion of Ma et al.

According to this criterion, setting 30 deceptive reviews in a batch could not only ensure the quality of data annotation but also maximize the number of annotations obtained from a single participant. Therefore, we randomly selected 300 deceptive reviews from the collected reviews and divided these deceptive reviews into 10 batches.

Most research on linguistic analysis of deceptive reviews uses the LIWC tool to calculate the linguistic features (such as shorter words (Zhang et al. 2016) , pronouns (Plotkina et al. 2020) , and information richness (Zhang et al. 2022 )) and psychological features (such as emotions (Yin et al. 2021) , perceptual information (Ansari and Gupta, 2021) , and cognitive burden (Wu et al. 2020) ).

                "text": "As shown in Model 1, perceptual cues are negatively related to emotion-based deceptive reviews (\u03b2= -0.085, p < 0.01). Similarly, the deceptive reviews under the motivate of perfunctory response also lack the perception process words (\u03b2= -0.104, p < 0.01), as in Model 2. The results of Model 3 and Model 4 show similar relationships between deceptive reviews and perception cues, with deceptive reviews for financial incentives at \u03b2= -0.215, < 0.001, and deceptive reviews from paid posters at \u03b2= -0.191, p < 0.001. Overall, the percentage of perceptual cue words is lower than 9% in more than 80% of the 264 deceptive reviews (the mean value of perceptual cues in authentic reviews is 10.21%), and over 40% of these reviews do not contain any perceptual process words (Percept score is zero), which indicates that there is no description of the perception information of products or services in these deceptive reviews. This result suggests that there are few perception process words in deceptive reviews, and the description of perceptual cues is insufficient, which thus provides support for Hypothesis 5. In other words, the empirical data on Amazon.com support our prediction that all deceptive reviews lack perceptual cues. As expected, Model 1 shows that the relationship between affective cues and emotion-based deceptive reviews is significant (\u03b2= 0.225, p < 0.001). Under the motive of emotional catharsis, reviewers use either positive emotional words to express affection and appreciation of the target product or negative emotional words to express dissatisfaction with the target product, and thus affective cues are positively related to emotion-based deceptive reviews. Hypothesis 1 is thus supported. Model 2 shows that detail cues are negatively related to deceptive reviews under the perfunctory response (\u03b2= -0.194, p < 0.001), which indicates that there are few function words in the deceptive reviews under the motive of perfunctory response, and these reviews are short of detailed information. The result thus provides support for Hypothesis 2, which states that deceptive reviews with perfunctory responses are negatively related to detail cues. In addition, fraudulent promulgators would write deceptive reviews with less information when they are motivated by emotional catharsis and perfunctory responses, resulting in short review lengths. Consequently, review length is negatively related to deceptive reviews under the motives of emotional catharsis and perfunctory response.",

When reviewers are motivated by the financial rewards to post reviews, they just meet the minimum requirements for the review set by the vendors, such as the number of words and sharing the photo of the target product. The textual contents of these reviews lack objective evaluation of the target product and sometimes are irrelevant to the product, which leads to deceptive reviews of little or no reference value for other potential consumers.

The purpose of paid posters is to mislead consumers by fabricating an imaginary story in the reviews. However since the paid posters have not purchased and used the products, it is very difficult for them to describe product details and after-use experience in deceptive reviews. Therefore, deceptive reviews posted by the paid posters would contain more cognitive cues as a result of the cognitive operations to make their reviews look more convincing. The result again provides support for Hypothesis 4, that is, the deceptive reviews from paid posters contain more descriptions of cognitive expressions, and thus are positively related to cognitive cues. Moreover, review length is positively related to deceptive reviews under the motives of financial incentives and paid posters. This is because fraudulent promulgators would write longer reviews to make deceptive reviews look like authentic ones, and these longer reviews can also make them more inconspicuous in online review fraud.",

This implies that authentic consumers were less inclined to express emotional catharsis in their reviews.

Different from the first data annotation task, participants were required to select whether the deceptive review r was posted under motive m. Specifically, we first categorized the 264 deceptive reviews by their motive types with the criterion that the probability of the review r being labeled as the motive m exceeds 66.7% (i.e. more than twothirds of the participants regard that the review r is posted under the motivation m). Here, a deceptive review could be categorized into multiple motive types because a deceptive review might be annotated as multiple motive labels. Then, we calculated the percentage of participants who agreed that the deceptive review r was posted under motive m. The results show that for each review r of all 264 reviews, more than 86.2% of the participants regard that it is posted due to motive m. Therefore, we conclude that the data annotation method is accurate, and the data annotation process does not pose a serious problem in data analysis and the findings.",

From the theoretical perspective, while many studies have examined deceptive reviews as a pervasive issue in the platform economy and its potential damage to e-commerce businesses (Plotkina et al. 2020; Zhuang et al. 2018) , relatively few studies have explored the underlying motives for individual consumers' deceptive reviews as well as the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews under different motives. In this study, we propose there are four different motives for posting deceptive online reviews based on the previous research, including emotional catharsis, perfunctory response, financial incentives, and paid posters, and then empirically validate the significant linguistic differences of deceptive online reviews with different motives. This study is thus able to provide important insights for better understanding the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews under different motives and shed light on how to develop a more integrated theory on deceptive reviews and further on knowledge management in the increasingly digitalized world (Chen et al. 2021) , an emerging phenomenon facing all the scholars in e-commerce businesses in the era of the platform economy.",

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply the reality monitoring theory to explore the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews under different motivations. This theory has been applied in linguistic research on cognitive psychology (Dijkstra and Fleming, 2023) and deceptive language (Mac Giolla et al. 2019 ). This study not only extends it to the analysis of the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews but also examines the differences in the linguistic characteristics and psychological characteristics of deceptive reviews under different motives. We pay greater attention to building the connection between the reality monitoring theory and linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews rather than just text analysis. Therefore, this study extends the current literature on deceptive online reviews from a theoretical perspective.",

First, we provide consumers with a relatively clearer profile of deceptive online reviews under different motives to help them understand deceptive online reviews. While past studies have identified distinctive characteristics or cues that can be used to differentiate between deceptive reviews and authentic reviews, no study has examined these characteristics by dividing deceptive reviews into different motives. The findings of this study thus provide a more nuanced understanding of deceptive reviews under different motives to help develop more accurate distinctions. Consumers can try to avoid using the linguistic features of deceptive reviews in creating high-quality authentic online reviews if they have more knowledge about the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews. Consumers could shape their perceived authenticity of online reviews based on the knowledge of linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews. In this regard, deceptive reviews would be a futile strategy when consumers gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews (Banerjee and Chua, 2021) . Even though adding deceptive reviews may make the product sound more attractive, consumers would suspect the authenticity of and discount the value of deceptive reviews, consequently reducing their purchase willingness. It is thus better for both consumers and e-commerce businesses to develop a trusting relationship and for e-commerce businesses to achieve more sustainable and healthy growth when deceptive reviews are reduced or removed (Mayzlin et al. 2014) .",

For online platforms, one of the key challenges is how to guide consumers to contribute high-quality online reviews because these reviews are key to developing the value and sustainability of e-commerce businesses (Yu et al. 2022) . Reviewers' misuse of linguistic features of deceptive reviews may cause unintended biases that ultimately affect the credibility of reviews. Thus, e-commerce businesses could consider using review tips to guide consumers to post highly credible online reviews. For instance, e-commerce businesses could guide reviewers to avoid using excessive language features that are irrelevant to the target product when they encourage consumers to contribute online reviews by providing financial incentives. When consumers post negative reviews due to their dissatisfaction with products or services, e-commerce businesses should guide consumers to describe the shortcomings of goods or services in their reviews rather than just using overly negative linguistic expressions. Otherwise, these reviews will be mistaken as deceptive reviews by consumers. Therefore, e-commerce businesses could increase the value and sustainability of e-commerce businesses and facilitate the establishment of effective online customer information management systems.",

This may help solve the problem that has often frustrated e-commerce businesses: without knowing the nuance of deceptive reviews' impact on purchase decisions, e-commerce businesses or other online vendors have to spend more resources to inspect all the reviews to identify deceptive reviews. Although e-commerce businesses can use internal filtering algorithms to identify and filter out deceptive reviews through automated algorithms, real-time detection of deceptive reviews is not yet possible. On the one hand, the system of Amazon is not already successful in removing the deceptive reviews and the internal filter algorithm of Amazon cannot spot all the deceptive reviews on the platform with its accuracy lower than 100 percent. For this reason, a series of third-party algorithms and Apps such as FakeSpot (Wu et al. 2021) , ReviewMeta (Choi et al. 2019) , and the Review Index (Choi et al. 2019) are developed outside the e-commerce platforms to help online shoppers clear up deceptive reviews from different perspectives. On the other hand, the removal of deceptive reviews on Amazon has taken place retroactively rather than proactively. That is, even if some deceptive reviews would be spotted by the internal algorithm of Amazon eventually, they could be shown in the review list for at least one week and during this time, these deceptive reviews could also online shoppers to make an unwise decision.",

First, although our study has proposed and then empirically tested some linguistic and textual features of deceptive reviews, it is still challenging to determine whether an online review is deceptive based on these linguistic manifestations alone (Plotkina et al. 2020) . Other factors need to be considered to accurately identify deceptive reviews. Therefore, our study can provide important clues to help understand deceptive online reviews rather than provide a guaranteed approach to identifying deceptive reviews. In addition, the proposed motives are not an exhaustive list of possible motives for deceptive online reviews. Future research could explore other antecedents of deceptive reviews to better understand and further help identify deceptive reviews. Second, the independent variables in our research are limited within the scope of features produced by LIWC2015. In addition, because deceptive reviews generated by computer bots are easy to identify, this research does not consider the significant number of deceptive reviews that are auto-generated by computer bots. Future research could consider more language styles of deceptive reviews and incorporate more deceptive language cues into the model to improve the language features of deceptive reviews (Kumar et al. 2019) . Third, the sentiment intensity of deceptive online reviews would differ significantly with different motives, and this study does not examine the relationship between positive or negative emotion intensity and deceptive reviews. Future research could analyze and identify the specific association between review sentiment intensity and the truthfulness of online reviews. Fourth, although the LIWC tool could calculate the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews, this study does not consider the effect of word position in the linguistic manifestations of deceptive reviews. Future research could also explore the ordering effect of words to better understand the linguistic manifestations of deceptive online reviews.",

Customers can write their opinions in reviews to express the value and quality of purchased goods and services. These opinions are used to make purchase decisions by customers and design market strategies by sellers. The trustiness of online reviews highly affects a company's reputation and economic benefit. That is why online sellers hire people to write deceptive opinions to recommend their products or defame competitors' products. Detecting deceptive opinion spam has emerged as a challenging task. The article describes the publicly available review datasets and explores their deficiencies in finding deceptive opinion spam. This literature systematically unwinds prominent features and approaches that have been introduced to extricate the problem of deceptive opinion spam detection. Our primordial objective is to confer a solemnity analysis of recent papers on deceptive opinion spam detection that describes methodologies' features, strengths, and constraints.

Online reviews are now playing a significant role in purchasing and selling products of customers and vendors, respectively. Based on these reviews, sellers can also design their additional marketing strategies and future planning of production. Unfortunately, this significance of reviews offers an excellent temptation for spamming, which incorporates malicious fable positive or negative opinions. Many companies appoint skilled people called spammers to write fictitious opinions to encourage their goods or Sushil Kumar Maurya sushilbbiet@gmail.com Dinesh Singh dinesh singh@mnnit.ac.in Ashish Kumar Maurya ashishmaurya@mnnit.ac.in 1 Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad, Prayagraj 211004, India services and gain economic benefits. Fictitious reviews are also called Deceptive Opinion Spam, which may be positive (hype) or negative opinions (defame). Some professional websites such as Yelp 1 and Amazon 2 have already taken the necessary steps to identify deceptive opinion spam to combat this problem. Nevertheless, deceptive opinion spam detection techniques still have much room for improvement.",

They described three types of opinions (reviews): deceptive opinions (Type 1, e.g., hype or defame), opinions on brands only (Type 2), and non-opinions (Type 3, such as advertisement, questionanswering, and comments). Type 2 and Type 3 are called disruptive opinions, easily identified through human reading, as represented in Table 1 . Using the bigram shingle method, they have detected duplicates and near-duplicates (similarity score of review pairs > 90%) as opinion spam. They then labeled 470 deceptive reviews of Type 2 and Type 3 and applied supervised learning to detect them with 98.7% area under curve (AUC) value. Nowadays, spammers are experts in writing fake reviews (Type 1), which is hard to label manually. Therefore, checking the legitimacy of deceptive online reviews becomes a difficult challenge. For example, two hotel reviews were considered, which are given below [78].",

These techniques are primarily used in review text, as it is challenging to detect deceptive opinion spam by perceiving product reviews in chronological order.

The work concludes that spammers can write imaginative opinions using more adverbs, verbs, or pronouns. In contrast, genuine users write informative reviews using more nouns or adjectives to share their experiences. They found POS feature is less effective than BOW in the same domain.

Many researchers used word embedding techniques to represent every review into the vector, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, etc. Mikolov et al. [68] introduced a Word2Vec model for representing words into the vectors using shallow neural networks. In this model, each word is defined in many dimensions that describe relation with other words and capture more semantic information. Trained vectors encode many linguistic regularities and patterns represented as linear translations. This model is based on two techniques: skip-gram and a continuous bag of words (CBOW). This method of representation causes terms with a similar meaning to have a similar representation, which will increase the classifier's efficiency. Word2Vec is a predictive model and cannot capture the global word co-statistics of a given corpus. To address this issue, [83] discovered a count-based GloVe model that differs from the Word2Vec model. Global vector (GloVe) incorporates word-word co-occurrence matrices from a corpus to obtain word vectors. Liu et al. [62] implemented multi-modal using Keras and pre-train 300-dimensional GloVe embedding to a text representation.",

This model gives the mysterious disparities between the topic-word distributions of genuine opinion and deceptive opinion spam. Jia et al.

Cao et al. [12] have explored a method that combined two granular implicit semantic features: coarse-grained (such as sentence, topic, and document) and fine-grained (such as term or word). The coarse-grained features from the topic distribution of reviews by concatenating LDA and backpropagation (BP) neural network and fine-grained features are obtained from the word2vec representation of reviews using deep learning (like LSTM, BiLSTM, and TextCNN) models.

The existing works have used meta-data features to capture the unusual spammer's behavior and create more effective deceptive opinion spam models to calculate spamicity scores. For example, suppose any user frequently writes multiple positive (with the highest rating) or negative (with the lowest rating) reviews of a particular product using different user-ids on the same computer. In that case, it may be a suspicious review. In hotel reviews, one can sometimes see positive reviews from places around the hotel; These reviews may not be authentic; However, hotel reviewers usually write their opinions only when they are away from that hotel's geographical location. The essential meta-data features are described below.",

When someone writes a deceptive review in the language used, some indications of linguistic deception can be seen. Content-based approaches are widely used for detecting deceptive opinion spam where supervised learning classifiers such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM) require labeled datasets for training. Jindal and Liu [39] used content features to find duplication and near-duplication of reviews and got 63% accuracy. They built a logistic regression model using the duplicate reviews as labeled spam training samples and the rest of the reviews as labeled non-spam training samples. Ott et al. [78] used linguistic features with a combination of POS tagged features to build an SVM classifier. They have collected synthetic datasets in their experiments and achieved an accuracy of 89.6%. The lack of experimentation on the real dataset is an essential drawback of the proposed model [73]. Feng et al. [23] used shallow syntax and deep syntax features as a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) rule-based encoding TF-IDF with uni-gram to improve the performance, but these patterns are not so valuable for a real dataset.",

This type of representation model, based on neural networks, can encode some semantic and syntactic properties of words. In some cases, the word embedding technique is directly used to train other non-neural models to obtain an optimal classifier. In most studies, lexiconbased techniques are used for aspect-based sentiment analysis, improving opinion spam detection performance. Experimental results show that LDA-based topic modeling is better to perform than SVM. The primary issue in the content-based approach is less availability of labeled datasets. In this domain, real-world labeled datasets are hard to obtain, and most of the datasets available are synthetically generated. However, it is unreliable to construct models based on synthetically generated datasets. Therefore, the researchers have used semi-supervised learning on a limited labeled dataset instead of supervised learning. This learning technique might ultimately alleviate the problem of the labor-intensive issue of identifying and labeling data. Recently, deep learning has been used to learn global semantic representations for text documents, yielding highly competitive performance. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can extract prominent n-gram features from an input text document to represent informative semantic for a document. But CNN is unable to preserve sequential information and long-term dependency of the text content.",

They worked on review patterns and star ratings to find various types of spamming behaviors (such as duplication of reviews, i.e., a reviewer writes multiple opinions on a target product). They framed four models, i.e., target products (TP), target groups (TG), early rating deviation (ERD), and general rating deviation (GRD), for calculating spamicity scores. Jindal et al. [40] stated that unexpected rules and unexpected groups indicate abnormal behaviors of spammers. These unusual behaviors are a prime indication of spam activities. Mukherjee et al. [71] proposed a new model GSRank for ranking group spam using a relation-based iterative model. They used frequent item-set mining (FIM) to generate candidate reviewer groups by computing group deviation (GD), time window (TW), member content similarity (MCS), group content similarity (GCS), the ratio of group size (RGS), group size (GS), early time frame (ETF), and support count (SC). Mukherjee et al. [72] have proposed an unsupervised author spamicity model (ASM) on behavioral footprints to detect spammers and achieved an accuracy of 74.6%. Their model is expensive and painstaking for broad-scale machine learning and analysis. Moreover, they ignored the usable review text generality information and did not consider the item's abnormal features. Fei et al. [22] employed a loopy belief propagation (LBP) based on a message-passing algorithm to solve approximate inference problems. They proposed a kernel density estimation (KDE) based algorithm for detecting review-burst and used several indicators in review burst to find review spammers. Ji et al. [36] proposed a group spam detection using a review burst (GSDB) model to discover candidate spammer groups. They used individual and group behavior features to build the GSDB model.",

Secondly, content-based models have domain dependence and can not be applied to various domains. Moreover, content-based models require labeled datasets, which is hard to prepare manually. Therefore, the researchers have focused on a behavioral-based approach. Existing research revealed that the various individual and group behavior indicators are useful in discriminating between spam and genuine reviews. The article shows that the GSRank model achieves high success than supervised learning techniques like SVM and regression. Many samples are required to observe behavioral features, and hence the detection process becomes more costly. It is not easy to extract compelling behavioral features for new users if they have only posted one review. Thus, the behavioral-based approaches are suffering from the cold start problem. Therefore, to solve this issue, authors need a lot of reviews for singleton users. It may be done by jointly utilizing reviewers' behavioral and textual features.",

At each step of the tree-building process, information gain is used to decide which attribute to split on. The first split starts with the maximum information gain as the root node of the decision tree. Inner nodes of DT are labeled with distinct attributes, and these attributes have less information gain than the root node. This process continues until all internal nodes have consistent data or information gain becomes zero. The core decision tree algorithm developed by Quinlan is ID3. Sanjay and Danti [94] used DT with information gain to find deceptive opinion 32 spam and achieved a 96% success rate on LED TV reviews in the Amazon dataset. Barbado et al.

[56] have experimented on four different semi-supervised learning algorithms: self-training, co-training, transductive SVM, and label propagation and label spreading. They found that self-training with naive Bayes classifier achieved 93% accuracy on the AMT dataset and 73% accuracy on the Yelp dataset.",

A rule is built from combining various n-gram features, word count, unique word percentages, and review rating deviation in content features. The experimental results show that the rule-based classification model performs better than the machine learning model. Some researchers used heuristic rules(i.e., if A then B) to detect deceptive opinion spam. Rule-based approaches have been beneficial for a massive dataset, reducing the burden of the content-based approach.

SpEagle comparatively performed better than FraudEagle, and it takes more effort to calculate prior knowledge. Wang et al.

Therefore, The researchers have proposed various graph-based approaches(i.e., FraudEagle and SpEagle) to find relationships among reviewers' opinions, reviewers, and products. FraudEagle is unable to capture additional prior knowledge in the graphical network. Therefore, the author enhances the performance of FraudEagle as a SpEagle using some additional features like review text, timestamp, and rating. Both models, FraudEagle and SpEagle, work on individual spammers and cannot capture group spamming. The MRF-based co-review pairs model ColluEagle has been proposed to detect individual review spammers and spammer groups. Experimental results have shown that ColluEagle can significantly increase the detecting precision. The literature concludes that spammers use multiple identities to post their reviews, and it is often hard to recognize them by simple spam detection techniques. The authors have proposed two techniques, semantic similarity, and topic modeling similarity, to recognize a spammer's reviews written under different user's Ids. Existing classification systems would not work for a long time because of the ever-changing behavior of spammers. Thus, researchers need to propose efficient spamming filters to monitor opinion spammers' dynamic behavior to deter potential fraud.",

Earlier models like Word2Vec and GloVe learn a single representation for each word without its context. Later these representation models scale up to sentences and documents. Today, the models learned word representation based on the word's context. If two models are developed to perform similar tasks, generalized learning knowledge can be transferred between them rather than training separately.

Many reviews are added through numerous social media tools, facing more challenges in mining reviews and deriving truthful conclusions effectively. Consumers are free to write their opinion on the commercial or social website, and there is no control over the quality of reviews, including which deceptive reviews are considered worst. The availability of fake reviews also makes the problem more severe as it may impair consumer buying decisions.

Most of the existing works have used textual features and behavioral features individually. Therefore, to improve the existing training model's efficiency, it needs to be fitted with an optimum hybrid features set that can improve the detection model. Cold-start Review detection is still a challenge. Finding effective spamming behaviors for singleton reviews (i.e., a review by new users who post only one review) is a challenging task. Many researchers are still working on the cold-start problem using a generative adversarial network. Reviews can be in more than one language, which is challenging to handle. Many dictionaries (WordNet, SentiWordNet) and tools (LIWC) are available to analyze English language reviews that can easily find the word's semantic meaning. Thus, in-depth research needs to be done on detecting deceptive opinion spam in multilingual reviews.",

The unavailability of multidimensional data is a big challenge in this area. The models used in deceptive opinion spam detection based on the old dataset are less precise and inaccurate; therefore, reconstruct this model (concept drift). Thus, it is a challenge to create an appropriate model that can handle the target concept drift and be rapidly adapt to it. The literature indicates that detecting spammer groups is the more essential part of the research on deceptive opinion spam. Burst patterns are a more crucial behavior of spamming.

Even though many studies have developed their synthetic datasets, these datasets are not ground truth real-world reviews because these are written by Turkers or other people, not by real spammers. In this way, evaluating classifiers can be problematic. Therefore, the attention of the researchers moved towards semi-supervised models (Co-training and PU learning), which require few labeled data.

The unlabeled data classification process is repeated until it converges into a stagnant classifier and a labeled set. Mukherjee et al. [70] have propounded an unsupervised generative model to detect deceptive opinion spam. They exploit linguistic and behavioral features in their experiment. Stanton and Irissappane [101] proposed a semi-supervised GAN model, called spamGAN, to detect deceptive opinion spam. They used an ADAM optimizer to train the generator and discriminator. Experimental results show that the model performs better than other models on the TripAdvisor dataset. Self-training It is generally used for semi-supervised learning. In self-training, the limited volume of labeled data is first trained by a classifier, and then the classification model is used to classify unlabeled data. The classified data are called pseudo-label data added to the labeled dataset. The classifier is re-trained on the combined pseudo-labeled and labeled training data. After that, the trained classifier is used to predict the labeled test dataset. This process repeated until the convergence. Navastaraet al. [76] used self-training semisupervised learning on 600 manufactured product reviews (200 labeled and the rest 400 unlabeled) such as a printer, monitor, laptop, music player, CD. Ligthart et al. [56] have analyzed that the self-training model can obtain better results than the supervised models if they use a limited labeled dataset.",

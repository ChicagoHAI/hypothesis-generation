When arriving at a purchasing decision, a majority of online consumers rely on reviews since they offer credible means of mining opinions of other consumers regarding a particular product. The trustworthiness of online reviews directly affects a company's reputation and profitability, which is why certain business owners pay fraudsters to generate deceptive reviews. Such generation of deceptive reviews which manipulate the purchasing decision of consumers is a persistent and harmful issue. Hence, developing methods to assist businesses and consumers by distinguishing between credible reviews and deceptive reviews remains to be a crucial, yet challenging task. In view of that, this paper unravels prominent techniques that have been proposed to solve the issue of deceptive review detection. Accordingly, the primary goal of this paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of current research on detecting deceptive reviews and to identify the characteristics, strengths, and bottlenecks of those methodologies which may need further improvements.",

                "text": "The advancement of Web 2.0 has augmented the trend of online purchasing via e-commerce websites. Online reviews, generated through e-commerce websites and social media denote consumer perception and these reviews play a significant role in e-business, for they could indirectly affect future purchasing decisions. Product manufacturers use reviews to identify product problems as well as to find market intelligence information about their competitors. Leveraging the judging ability of the quality of products/services through online reviews, fraudsters generate fabricated reviews called 'deceptive reviews' to reshape business. Higher numbers of positive reviews induce a customer to purchase a product and fortify financial gains of manufacturers while negative reviews prompt consumers to look for alternatives, thereby causing financial losses. Consequently, a large number of reviews are added through different tools on social media, bringing more challenges in mining opinions and deriving truthful conclusions effectively. Further, there is no control over the quality and content of the web which facilitates the generation of many low-quality consumer reviews out of which deceptive reviews are considered the worst. Thus, the availability of deceptive reviews makes the situation graver as they could influence the potential to reverse a purchase decision. Also worth noting is the ability vendors possess to generate deceptive reviews as the means of either promoting their products or unfairly tarnishing the image of their competitors.",

Destructive reviews are non-reviews, comprising mainly of advertisements and other irrelevant reviews containing no opinion (Ren et al. 2014 ). However, deceptive reviews cause more damage, for they deliberately mislead readers by giving undeserving positive reviews to certain target objects in order to promote the objects, or by giving negative reviews to some target objects in order to damage their reputation (Ren et al. 2014) . Deceptive reviews can negatively impact on business due to the loss in consumer trust as well (Crawford et al. 2015) . While positive reviews increase the revenue, the negative reviews may decrease the conversions by as far as 67% (Campbell 2014) . According to Campbell (2014) , 66% of customers place more trust in e-commerce websites that have both positive and negative reviews.",

Furthermore, traditional classification learning methods are quite user-friendly as they utilize manually labeled training data to detect these two types of spam. Nevertheless, recognizing whether a review is an untruthful opinion spam (type 1) is extremely difficult by manually reading the review because one can carefully craft a spam review similar to any other original/real review (Farooq and Khanday 2016) . Due to financial benefits offered for generating deceptive reviews, fraudsters attempt to generate fake reviews for the purpose of promoting or de-promoting a product/service. However, these spammers can easily disguise themselves in cyberspace, which makes it relatively difficult to identify them. Due to these phenomena, there is a lacuna of reliable data related to fake and genuine reviews that can be treated as training data.",

Review-centric features are the features that construct using the information contained in a single review (Crawford et al. 2015) . These features are categorized into linguistic features, POS tagging, N-grams, sentiments, textual features, rating-related features, and quality-related features. However, purely content-based classifiers have several limitations. Firstly, the spammers can easily manipulate the content to avoid review detection for spam. For example, if the duplicate reviews are to be considered as spam, the spammers may simply reword the content. Secondly, content-based spam detection is designed for specific application domains and it cannot be easily applied to diverse domains. Accordingly, the content-based approach compares the linguistic features of genuine and spam reviews. Thirdly, most content-based classifiers require manually-labeled real datasets.",

Approximately 85% of spammers wrote more than 80% of their reviews as positive reviews; thus, a high percentage of positive reviews can be considered an indication of an untrustworthy reviewer. The average review length could also be regarded as an important indication of reviewers with questionable intentions since about 80% of spammers have no reviews longer than 135 words, while more than 92% of reliable reviewers have an average review length of greater than 200 words (Crawford et al. 2015) .",

Banerjee et al.

They achieved highperformance levels using PU learning-based classification. It was observed that spammers' ratings tend to deviate from the average review rating at a far higher rate than legitimate reviewers, thus identifying that user rating deviations may help in detection of dishonest reviewers (Crawford et al. 2015) . Moreover, it was identified that the presence of similar reviews for different products by the same reviewer has been shown to be a strong indication of a spammer (Crawford et al. 2015) . If the reviews are written for verified purchases they will most likely reflect a genuine review and a reviewer with a higher ratio of verified purchases can be considered as more trustworthy (Crawford et al. 2015) . Jindal et al. (2010) suggested using unexpected deviations from the expected behavior of reviewers since unexpected rules discovered the suspicious behavior of reviewers. Furthermore, Lim et al. (2010) proposed a behavioral approach to detect review spammers who tried to manipulate review ratings on some target products or product groups. They derived an aggregated behavior scoring method to rank reviewers as per the degree they demonstrated spamming related behaviors. In addition, Feng et al.

It should also be highlighted that detecting pseudo-reviews requires both linguistic features and behavioral features (Shivagangadhar et al. 2015) and the combinatory approach using psycho-linguistically motivated features and n-gram features can perform slightly better (Shivagangadhar et al. 2015) . Furthermore, Banerjee et al. (2015) exposed that the understandability, level of details, writing style, and cognition indicators offer useful linguistic clues to distinguish between authentic and fake reviews. Also, the titles of reviews are as useful as their descriptions can use to distinguish between authentic and fake reviews by incorporating meta-classification algorithms such as voting, which emerged as the best performing algorithm. In addition, Lai et al. (2010a) found that Self-supervised Decision Tree method is more flexible than most supervised spam detection systems which depend primarily on pre-classified data. The KL divergence and the probabilistic language modeling-based computational model are also considered to be effective for the detection of untruthful reviews. Moreover, the SVM-based method is yet another effective mechanism to detect non-reviews (Lai et al. 2010a) .",

Further, the aggregated behavior scoring methods depicted outperformed results (Lim et al. 2010 ) and unexpected rules and groups represented abnormal or unusual behaviors of reviewers, thereby indicating spam activities (Jindal et al. 2010) . Moreover, Mukherjee et al. (2013) found that the Author Spamicity Model is effective and it outperforms strong competitors. In view of this, it could be suggested to incorporate review spammer detection for review detection and vice versa to explore new ways to learn spamming related behavior patterns (Lim et al. 2010) .",

Most of the researches, in this context, focused on machinelearning techniques. Even though Jindal and Liu (2007, 2008) found LR to be highly effective, SVM presented a high accuracy and precision by including a new set of features (Christopher and Rahulnath 2016; Daiyan et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014) . Nonetheless, Rout et al. (2016) asserted that Decision Trees have the potential of achieving high performance in comparison to other supervised approaches, while Mushtaq et al. (2016) articulated that Bayes probabilistic classifier is more sensitive to detect spam. Lin et al. (2014) elaborated in their study that the unsupervised method which uses a spam score with a threshold value can achieve a relatively positive effect without training samples. Also worth noting is that unsupervised methods such as LSM-UP and LSM-HE significantly outperform baseline clustering methods on entropy, purity, and F1 (Mukherjee et al. 2013) . Further, singular value decomposition (SVD) is also known to outperform the unsupervised hedge algorithm (UH) (Wu et al. 2010a ). The unsupervised clustering explored distortion in popularity ranking and that distortion contributes to demarcate true positives from false positives (Wu et al. 2010b ). The semi-supervised two-view co-training algorithms can achieve better results than the single-view algorithms (Li et al. 2011) . Jindal and Liu (2007, 2008) further suggested using a dataset in a different domain and aligning with that, Christopher and Rahulnath (2016) , analysed on social media data which revealed more behavioral traits of reviewers. Li et al. (2011) , exploiting the probabilistic two-view algorithm such as Co-EM, suggested to model the uncertainty in review spam identification task and to test the co-training algorithm in other opinion resources such as blogs, or Twitter. Daiyan et al. (2014) also suggested improving the detection method with a different corpus.",

For single host approaches, analytical frameworks such as the BIG Data Suite support batch mode processing of big data, whereas the MOA framework can be used to analyze evolving big data streams (Zhang et al. 2014) . It is believed that combining both batch and streaming modes of analytics is essential to develop an operational big data analytics framework to support real-world applications. Since spammers tend to modify their deceptive styles, it is crucial to design an adaptive detection method that could continuously improve its feature set and system parameters based on users' feedback (Zhang et al. 2014) . Accordingly, Zhang et al. (2014) designed a novel big data analytic framework which influenced the distributed computing and streaming to efficiently process big social media data streams. Subsequently, they applied the proposed framework that was supported by a novel parallel co-evolution genetic algorithm to adaptively detect deceptive reviews with respect to different social media contexts (Zhang et al. 2014) .",

Further, the usage of manually labeled data or AMT crowd-sourced data cannot be treated as reliable. Hence, future researchers should primarily focus on less number of labeled datasets or neither. Also worth nothing is that it does not suffice to extract a permanent set of features concerning the content of the review or reviewer behavior. Therefore, most of the researchers have used a combination of review-centric, reviewer-centric and product-related features when detecting deceptive reviews. Another major concern is that the consumer reviews are generated in high volume with velocity and variety, thereby being treated as big data which requires the application of big data analytic approaches to analyze reviews and identify deceptive reviews in real-time or near real-time. After having compared different approaches in a wider spectrum, it can be concluded that each approach has its own positive and negative impact. Hence, it is wise to consider a hybrid approach, taking all positive aspects identified in the above discussion.",

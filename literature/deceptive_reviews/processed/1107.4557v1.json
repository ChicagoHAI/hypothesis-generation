Opinion spam can range from annoying self-promotion of an unrelated website or blog to deliberate review fraud, as in the recent case3 of a Belkin employee who hired people to write positive reviews for an otherwise poorly reviewed product. 4While other kinds of spam have received considerable computational attention, regrettably there has been little work to date (see Section 2) on opinion spam detection. Furthermore, most previous work in the area has focused on the detection of DISRUPTIVE OPINION SPAM-uncontroversial instances of spam that are easily identified by a human reader, e.g., advertisements, questions, and other irrelevant or nonopinion text (Jindal and Liu, 2008) . And while the presence of disruptive opinion spam is certainly a nuisance, the risk it poses to the user is minimal, since the user can always choose to ignore it.",

In contrast, we find deceptive opinion spam detection to be well beyond the capabilities of most human judges, who perform roughly at-chance-a finding that is consistent with decades of traditional deception detection research (Bond and DePaulo, 2006) .",

Recently, researchers have began to look at opinion spam as well (Jindal and Liu, 2008; Wu et al., 2010; Yoo and Gretzel, 2009) . Jindal and Liu (2008) find that opinion spam is both widespread and different in nature from either e-mail or Web spam. Using product review data, and in the absence of gold-standard deceptive opinions, they train models using features based on the review text, reviewer, and product, to distinguish between duplicate opinions7 (considered deceptive spam) and non-duplicate opinions (considered truthful). Wu et al. (2010) propose an alternative strategy for detecting deceptive opinion spam in the absence of gold-standard data, based on the distortion of popularity rankings. Both of these heuristic evaluation approaches are unnecessary in our work, since we compare gold-standard deceptive and truthful opinions. Yoo and Gretzel (2009) gather 40 truthful and 42 deceptive hotel reviews and, using a standard statistical test, manually compare the psychologically relevant linguistic differences between them. In contrast, we create a much larger dataset of 800 opinions that we use to develop and evaluate automated deception classifiers.",

Indeed, a two-tailed binomial test fails to reject the null hypothesis that JUDGE 2 and JUDGE 3 perform at-chance (p = 0.003, 0.10, 0.48 for the three judges, respectively). Furthermore, all three judges suffer from truth-bias (Vrij, 2008) , a common finding in deception detection research in which human judges are more likely to classify an opinion as truthful than deceptive. In fact, JUDGE 2 classified fewer than 12% of the opinions as deceptive! Interestingly, this bias is effectively smoothed by the SKEPTIC meta-judge, which produces nearly perfectly class-balanced predictions. A subsequent reevaluation of human performance on this task suggests that the truth-bias can be reduced if judges are given the class-proportions in advance, although such prior knowledge is unrealistic; and ultimately, performance remains similar to that of Table 2 .",

While achieving 95% truthful recall, this judge's corresponding precision was not significantly better than chance (two-tailed binomial p = 0.4). mated classifier outperforms most human judges (one-tailed sign test p = 0.06, 0.01, 0.001 for the three judges, respectively, on the first fold). This result is best explained by theories of reality monitoring (Johnson and Raye, 1981) , which suggest that truthful and deceptive opinions might be classified into informative and imaginative genres, respectively. Work by Rayson et al. (2001) has found strong distributional differences between informative and imaginative writing, namely that the former typically consists of more nouns, adjectives, prepositions, determiners, and coordinating conjunctions, while the latter consists of more verbs,17 adverbs,18 pronouns, and pre-determiners. Indeed, we find that the weights learned by POS SVM (found in Table 4 ) are largely in agreement with these findings, notably except for adjective and adverb superlatives, the latter of which was found to be an exception by Rayson et al. (2001) . However, that deceptive opinions contain more superlatives is not unexpected, since deceptive writing (but not necessarily imaginative writing in general) often contains exaggerated language (Buller and Burgoon, 1996; Hancock et al., 2008) .",

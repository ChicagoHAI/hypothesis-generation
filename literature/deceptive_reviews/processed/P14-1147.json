Studies in the literature rely on a couple of approaches for obtaining labeled data, which usually fall into two categories. The first relies on the judgements of human annotators (Jindal et al., 2010; Mukherjee et al., 2012) . However, recent studies show that deceptive opinion spam is not easily identified by human readers (Ott et al., 2011 ). An alternative approach, as introduced by Ott et al. (2011) , crowdsourced deceptive reviews using Amazon Mechanical Turk. 3 A couple of follow-up works have been introduced based on Ott et al.'s dataset, including estimating prevalence of deception in online reviews (Ott et al., 2012) , identification of negative deceptive opinion spam (Ott et al., 2013) , and identifying manipulated offerings (Li et al., 2013b) .",

Specifically, according to their findings (Ott et al., 2011;  has updated their guidelines on the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising to suggest that posting deceptive reviews may be unlawful in the United States (FTC, 2009) . Li et al., 2013a) , truthful hotel reviews encode more spatial details, characterized by terms such as \"bathroom\" and \"location\", while deceptive reviews talk about general concepts such as why or with whom they went to the hotel. However, a hotel can instead solicit fake reviews from their employees or customers who possess substantial domain knowledge to write fake reviews and encode more spatial details in their lies. Indeed, cases have been reported where hotel owners bribe guests in return for good reviews on TripAdvisor4 , or companies ordered employees to pretend they were satisfied customers and write glowing reviews of its face-lift procedure on Web sites. 5The domain knowledge possessed by domain experts enables them to craft reviews that are much more difficult for classifiers to detect, compared to the crowdsourced fake reviews.",

It is unclear whether these classifiers will perform well at detecting deception in other domains, e.g., Restaurant or Doctor reviews. Even in a single domain, e.g., Hotel, classifiers trained from reviews of one city (e.g., Chicago) may not be effective if directly applied to reviews from other cities (e.g., New York City) (Li et al., 2013b) . In the examples in Table 1 , we trained a linear SVM classifier on Ott's Chicago-hotel dataset on unigram features and tested it on a couple of different domains (the details of data acquisition are illustrated in Section 3). Good performance is obtained on Chicago-hotel reviews (Ott et al., 2011) , but not as good on New York City ones. The performance is reasonable in Restaurant reviews due to the many shared properties among restaurants and hotels, but suffers in Doctor settings.",

One contribution of the work presented here is the creation of the cross-domain (i.e., Hotel, Restaurant and Doctor) gold-standard dataset. In contrast to existing work (Ott et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013b) , our new gold standard includes three types of reviews: domain expert deceptive opinion spam (Employee), crowdsourced deceptive opinion spam (Turker), and truthful Customer reviews (Customer). In addition, some of domains contain both positive (P) and negative (N) reviews. 6To explore the general rule of deceptive opinion spam, we extended SAGE Model (Eisenstein et al., 2011) , a bayesian generative approach that can capture the multiple generative facets (i.e., deceptive vs truthful, positive vs negative, experienced vs non-experienced, hotel vs restaurant vs doctor) in the text collection. We find that more general features, such as LIWC and POS, are more robust when modeled using SAGE, compared with just bag-of-words.",

Instead, our finding suggest that other linguistic features may offer more robust cues to deceptive opinion spam, such as overly highlighted sentiment in the review or the overuse of firstperson singular pronouns.",

Jindal and Liu (2008) first studied the deceptive opinion problem and trained models using features based on the review text, reviewer, and product to identify duplicate opinions, i.e., opinions that appear more than once in the corpus with similar contexts. Wu et al. (2010) propose an alternative strategy to detect deceptive opinion spam in the absence of a gold standard. Yoo and Gretzel (2009) gathered 40 truthful and 42 deceptive hotel reviews and manually compare the linguistic differences between them. Ott et al. created a gold-standard collection by employing Turkers to write fake reviews, and follow-up research was based on their data (Ott et al., 2012; Ott et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013b; Feng and Hirst, 2013) . For example, Song et al. ( 2012) looked into syntactic features from Context Free Grammar parse trees to improve the classifier performance. A step further, Feng and Hirst (2013) make use of degree of compatibility between the personal experiment and a collection of reference reviews about the same product rather than simple textual features.",

(2011) , which can be viewed as an combination of topic models (Blei et al., 2003) and generalized additive models (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) . Unlike other derivatives of topic models, SAGE drops the Dirichlet-multinomial assumption and adopts a Laplacian prior, triggering sparsity in topic-word distribution. The reason why SAGE is tailored for our task is that SAGE constructs multi-faceted latent variable models by simply adding together the component vectors rather than incorporating multiple switching latent variables in multiple facets.",

However, according to our findings, we find the opposite to hold. Increased first person singular is an apparent indicator of deception, when comparing Figure 2 (b) to 2(c) and 2(e). We suspect that this relates to an effect observed in previous studies of deception, where liars inadvertently undermine their lies by overemphasizing aspects of their deception that they believe reflect credibility (Bond and DePaulo, 2006; DePaulo et al., 2003) . One interpretation for this phenomenon would be that deceivers try to overemphasize their physical presence because they believe that this increases their credibility.",

By soliciting fake reviews from participants, including crowd workers and domain experts, we have found that is possible to detect fake reviews with above-chance accuracy, and have used our models to explore several psychological theories of deception. However, it is still very difficult to estimate the practical impact of such methods, as it is very challenging to obtain gold-standard data in the real world. Moreover, by soliciting deceptive opinion spam in an artificial environment, we are endorsing the deception, which may influence the cues that we observe (Feeley and others, 1998; Frank and Ekman, 1997; Newman et al., 2003; Ott, 2013) . Finally, it may be possible to train people to tell more con-vincing lies. Many of the characteristics regarding fake review generation might be overcome by well-trained fake review writers, which would results in opinion spam that is harder for detect. Future work may wish to consider some of these additional challenges.",

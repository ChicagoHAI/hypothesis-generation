    "abstract": "A body of literature has demonstrated that users' mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, can be predicted from their social media language. There is still a gap in the scientific understanding of how psychological stress is expressed on social media. Stress is one of the primary underlying causes and correlates of chronic physical illnesses and mental health conditions. In this paper, we explore the language of psychological stress with a dataset of 601 social media users, who answered the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire and also consented to share their Facebook and Twitter data. Firstly, we find that stressed users post about exhaustion, losing control, increased self-focus and physical pain as compared to posts about breakfast, family-time, and travel by users who are not stressed. Secondly, we find that Facebook language is more predictive of stress than Twitter language. Thirdly, we demonstrate how the language based models thus developed can be adapted and be scaled to measure county-level trends. Since county-level language is easily available on Twitter using the Streaming API, we explore multiple domain adaptation algorithms to adapt user-level Facebook models to Twitter language. We find that domain-adapted and scaled social mediabased measurements of stress outperform sociodemographic variables (age, gender, race, education, and income), against ground-truth survey-based stress measurements, both at the user-and the county-level in the U.S. Twitter language that scores higher in stress is also predictive of poorer health, less access to facilities and lower socioeconomic status in counties. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of using social media as a new tool for monitoring stress levels of both individuals and counties.",

Stress is seen to be a single pervasive trait influencing health, through a broad range of negative affective states and somatic pathways (McEwen and Stellar 1993) .

                "text": "People are increasingly using social media platforms in order to inform others about their mental states, solicit social support, as well as keep records of their daily activities, preferences, and interests. Notwithstanding the challenge of working with a non-random, non-representative sample of social media users, studies have identified the markers of selfdisclosure which concern depression (Guntuku et al. 2017c) , schizophrenia (Ernala et al. 2017) , ADHD (Guntuku et al. 2017b) , alcohol consumption (Liu, Weitzman, and Chunara 2017) , and personality (Guntuku et al. 2017a) . With respect to stress, the linguistic features of event-related stress have been predicted from social media posts about experiences such as travel and work (Lin et al. 2014 ); however, these findings cannot be applied to improve the psychological understanding of stress, because people suffering from chronic stress do so irrespective of stressful events. For instance, preparing for an exam is a stressful event, while chronically feeling overwhelmed with responsibilities is trait-related stress. Another research gap is that the previous work has focused on known stressors collected using search keywords (Thelwall 2017) . However the labels thus acquired likely have personality confounds (Preotiuc-Pietro et al. 2015) , emphasizing the need for using stronger ground truth. Instead, we anticipate that insights into psychological stress could help in (a) designing social-media-based interventions to enable a lowstress lifestyle, and (b) developing a better understanding of regional variations in stress.",

However, except for a few studies, little has been done to explore how to scale language models to study regions, and no work yet has attempted to do this for stress. Although some studies have analyzed the geographic variation in social media language corresponding to chronic illnesses (Culotta 2014) , depression (Bagroy, Kumaraguru, and De Choudhury 2017) , well-being (Schwartz et al. 2013a ), heart-disease (Eichstaedt et al. 2015) , and happiness (Quercia et al. 2012) , they are often challenged by (a) a limited understanding of how to scale user-level models to measure counties, and (b) the lack of ground truth about a large population. Recent work has shown the need to use weighting and scaling techniques to transform user-level language estimates from Twitter to county-level estimates (Rieman et al. 2017) , in order to avoid the ecological fallacies reported in the studies mentioned above. However, there are challenges associated with transferring predictive models from one social media platform to another, because of differences in self-disclosure on Facebook vs. Twitter (Jaidka et al. 2018 ). This study contributes with (a) effective off-the-shelf methods for cross-domain adaptation of user-level stress models to measure county-level stress, and (b) validation against ground-truth survey data built on over two million responses.",

We show in Figure 1 , how our study uses transfer learning to adapt user-level models trained on their Facebook language, to predict countylevel stress from the county-level Twitter language. This is necessary because it is easier to train predictive models on the language of a small population of social media users, but it is expensive to survey entire counties for training purposes. Furthermore, county-level social media language is only available for Twitter, where approximately 20% of all public posts are geo-tagged with their location information, and they can be easily mined by using Twitter's Streaming API 1 . On the contrary, Facebook needs user authentication for accessing their posts which is resource intensive to collect 1 https://developer.twitter.com/en from a large number of people for this research study. Adapting models trained at user-level to predict stress in counties has multiple applications in monitoring health and well-being in counties, especially where survey data is hard to collect. Thus motivated, in this paper we address the following research questions:",

Given that psychologists have found stress to be a state result-ing from an individual assessing the demands of the stressful stimulus and determining own coping abilities (Staal 2004 ), this result is very intuitive. It should be noted that increased self-focus in stressful situations is likely adaptive, but a prolonged self-focus in one's thoughts, especially in the context of negative affect, is known to psychologists as rumination and linked to negative effects for health and well-being (Moberly and Watkins 2008) .

Further, high stress language seem to be comorbid with mental health conditions (\"depression\", \"depressed\", \"anxiety\", \"bipolar\"). It is interesting that language reflects the adverse effects that stress can have on health (Watson and Pennebaker 1989) . The language of low stress has prominent positive affect (\"excited to\"), discussions of meals (\"breakfast\"), as well as feelings of social inclusion (\"joined the\"). The language of low stress comprises the discussion of meals, specifically \"breakfast\", which may indicate relaxation and enjoyment inasmuch as meals are often taken in the company of others, social inclusion, as well as with positive affect (\"excited to\").",

The top correlated categories in Facebook comprise first person singular pronouns (\"I\"), indicating increased self-focus, which corroborate previous findings (Pennebaker and Lay 2002) that self-references by individuals increase in emotionally vulnerable situations. Users on Facebook are more likely to use adverbs such as \"very\" and \"really\" to emphasize their point, and more likely to explicitly use words denoting negative emotions, such as \"hurt\" and \"anger\". Mentions of negative emotion confirms our expectations, because stress is an aversive state (Cohen, Kessler, and Gordon 1997) . Filler word associations may indicate a lack of self-esteem or feeling down on oneself, and hedging as a result (Abouserie 1994) . Negation further suggests a 'lack of' things, mentioned and experienced by those who are also prone to high stress. On the other hand, the first person plural pronouns (\"We\"), and the LIWC \"Affiliation\" categories are negatively correlated with stress, which implies that a high-stress individual often depicts themselves as isolated, with a certain disassociation from their social circles. Negative correlations of stress with positive emotion reflects that those individuals reporting lower stress are significantly more likely to express positive emotion.",

We aim to train the best performing user-level model, as this directly impacts the county-level prediction accuracy.

These correlations are considered a high correlation in psychology, especially when measuring outcomes like stress (Meyer, Finn, and others 2001) . Part of this improvement is due to the amount of information that Facebook contains over Twitter (Table 4 ). However, Facebook alone is insufficient as the Twitter language is substantially different from Facebook (Tables 5 and 6 ). Predictive performance of sociodemographic variables (age, gender, income and education) and Twitter language are r=.24 and r=.34 respectivelt.

Individuals living in highstress counties appear to suffer from poor health, affected both by aspects in their individual lives as well as by the nature of their counties. Using social media language as a real-time proxy to assess a county's stress, and consequently, health, could help design interventions and policies to alleviate stressors. Language has the specific advantage of getting at the causes/stressors that counties are experiencing, and this could greatly complement and also inform traditional survey mechanisms (such as Gallup).",

Our findings also reiterate previous research on language use in mental health (De Choudhury et al. 2013 ). An important insight from our work was that the predictive utility of different platforms varies, as has been seen in prior research looking at differences in self-disclosure (Jaidka et al. 2018; Zhong et al. 2017) .

Monitoring stress levels in such counties would especially be useful in devising programs or initiatives to encourage a low-stress lifestyle amongst wherever individuals are particularly vulnerable to stress. While social media (and Twitter in particular) are not representative of the real-life users, several insights have been obtained using public Twitter data in public health (Yang et al. 2018) . Further, the underlying predictive model can be applied to several online forums. For example, it could be applied to colleges across the U.S. to understand the specific chronic stressors in different college campuses (extending the recent work (Saha and De Choudhury 2017; Bagroy, Kumaraguru, and De Choudhury 2017) ). It is especially promising that such measurements can be effective while being unobtrusive. Monitoring stress using social media also offers the advantage of discovering stress associations that are otherwise not easy to get by traditional surveys (Holdeman 2009) . Moreover, such a tool could monitor stress in real time, potentially detecting unforeseen events before they happen (Reason 1995) .",

As being chronically stressed can lead to stigma at multiple levels, data protection and ownership frameworks are necessary to make sure the data is not used against the users' interest (McKee 2013).

We anticipate that this reflects the tendency of Twitter users to drop self-referencing pronouns, as has been identified in previous work (Rouhizadeh et al. 2016) . Comparisons and differentiation could indicate lack of satisfaction with status quo, indicating possibly pessimism or expressing perceived resources to fall short of demands, or simply lower perceived satisfaction with life of those prone to stress (Linn et al. 1985) . Insecurities of those higher in stress may be what is indicated by correlations with nonfluencies (Felson, Scheff, and Retzinger 1993) . A \"focus on the past\" tends to be maladaptive and may indicate that those high in stress might find themselves stuck in what happened and in ruminative, self-deprecating thoughts.

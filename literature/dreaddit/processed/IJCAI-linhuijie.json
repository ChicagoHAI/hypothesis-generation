We rely on social networks to share our or others' daily activities with a wide audience. Besides, we use social networks to disclose emotions and moods, happiness and unhappiness, since disclosure is intrinsically rewarding and can improve interpersonal intimacy. Inevitably, the language used in social media postings may signal feelings of exhaustion, sleeping problems, sweating, loss of appetite and difficulty concentrating that characterize the major stress. It is thus feasible to detect users' psychological stress from social media data.",

Thereby, stress is so commonplace that it has become a way of life. Some stress is normal and even useful. For example, it can help us win a race or finish an important job on time. But when stress becomes overwhelming or lasts too long, it can damage our health, mood, relationships, and quality of life. Also, it can increase the risk of strokes, ulcers, and mental disorders. It is hence of importance to recognize the signs of stress in advance, which enables us to take proactive care to reduce the harmful effects of stress.",

Lin et al. and Xue et al. proposed novel methods to detect tweet-level stress [2014a; 2013; 2014] and user-level stress [2014b] over a short time window respectively. Despite great success, they only classified samples into stressed or non-stressed categories, which is incapable of measuring the exact stressor and stress level. Stress is indeed much more complicated, which is composed of two key factors: stressor and stress level. Quite literally, stressor, comprising of stressor event and stressor subject, triggers stress; meanwhile, different stressors incur different stress levels. For instance, a layoff usually makes people more stressed in comparison to a project deadline. In addition, stressor events happening to other subjects can also be someone's stress trigger, but may have different affects. For instance, \"my friend's father just passed away\". Moreover, stress level depends on the stressor, and is measurable using various psychological stress scales, despite that stress is often thought of as a subjective experience. As claimed by psychologists, detecting stressor and measuring the stress levels are of essential importance to proactive care.",

As known, social media postings are usually informally and ambiguously written with grammatical problems, while the current subject Lexicon tools are not well suited for such scenarios. 2) Stressor event detection. Psychologists manually define a set of stress-related events, which are usually not independent but correlated in a nonuniform way. Meanwhile, for some specific event categories, such as death, there are insufficient training samples. How to model the event relatedness and borrow training samples for the sample-lacking categories are largely untapped. And 3) data and representation. There is no publicly available benchmark datasets thus far that can be leveraged to conduct stress study and verify the effectiveness of models. In addition, it is of importance to extract a rich set of stress-oriented features to describe the data.",

As illustrated in Figure 1 , our scheme consists of three components. In particular, we first extract a set of discriminant features, including the hand-crafted statistical features and the high-level semantic features. We then propose a hybrid model combining multi-task learning with convolutional neural network (CNN) to respectively identify the stressor subjects and stressor events of the given social posts. It is worth mentioning that the relatedness among stressor events as well as stressor subjects is well captured and modeled in our model. Once we obtain the stressor subject and event category, we can lookup a standard psychological stress scale to measure the precise stressor and stress level. To verify our scheme, we construct a representative dataset from Weibo by an extendable set of seed words, and invite 30 volunteers to manually build the ground truth. Extensive experiments well validate our proposed scheme.",

Therefore, each tweet was labeled three times, and it was first labeled to be stress or non-stress related, and the stress related tweets were further categorized into one of 12 stressor event categories and six stressor subject categories, respectively. Following that, voting was performed to obtain the final ground truth. For the cases that there are two classes having the same number of ballots, a discussion was carried out among the labelers to decide the final ground truths. We finally collected a dataset containing nearly 2, 000 tweets. We also randomly selected 600 tweets that are labeled as non-stress related to be the negative samples.

It can be seen that shallow classification methods would not gain satisfactory performance on stressor event or subject detection tasks. However, our proposed hybrid model (h-MTL) is able to improve the detection performance by around 10% on F1-measure, indicating that the relatedness among different categories is important and our method can better capture the relatedness to enhance the detection performance. For the performance on stress level measurement tasks, it can be seen from Figure 2 (c) that our scheme gains much lower MSE (and thus higher prediction accuracy) compared with other methods. Meanwhile, Figure 2(d) shows that the training time of the proposed model is comparatively lower than SVM, GBDT and cASO-MTL, while achieving much higher performance. All the improvements reported are significant at 0.05 level under two-tailed t-tests.",

Finally, we evaluate the precise stressors and stress levels align with a widely-accepted psychological stress scale. To verify our scheme, we constructed a publicly available dataset with crowd-sourcing labeled ground truth. Experimental results show that our scheme achieves promising performances on measuring stress. Our technique serves as an assistant tool for psychologists to help detect stress, and our model as well as the released dataset further helps to promote the research of social media oriented intelligent digital health, which is destined to grow rapidly in the years ahead.",

This paper argues that, alongside assessments of the affective valence of social media content as negative or positive, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the context in which reactions are expressed and the specific functions that users' emotional states may reflect. To demonstrate this, we present a qualitative analysis of affective expressions on Twitter collected in Germany during the 2011 EHEC food contamination incident based on a coding scheme developed from Skinner et al.'s (2003) coping classification framework. Affective expressions of coping were found to be diverse not only in terms of valence but also in the adaptive functions they served: beyond the positive or negative tone, some people perceived the outbreak as a threat while others as a challenge to cope with. We discuss how this qualitative sentiment analysis can allow a better understanding of the way the overall situation is perceived e threat or challenge e and the resources that individuals experience having to cope with emerging demands.",

Even as brief as Twitter's 140 characters, social media reactions function as user-driven data that can be for example automatically classified in terms of their sentiment using opinion mining or machine learning techniques (e.g. Ghiassi, Skinner, & Zimbra, 2013; Thelwall, Buckley, Paltoglou, Cai, & Kappas, 2010) . Analysis of social media data seems particularly useful when unexpected and potentially stressful events occur and there is need of understanding how Internet users are making sense of them. Sentiment analysis over a large volume of usergenerated data have been used for example in rapid reputation assessments (e.g. brand management, political marketing) or as an indication of how digital publics respond to events, associated with television shows, football games, significant news or other meaningful events (see e.g. Brooker, Barnett, Cribbin, Lang, & Martin, 2013; Highfield, Harrington, & Bruns, 2013; Thelwall, Buckley, & Paltoglou, 2011) .",

These situations involve a deviation from the \"normal\" state that existed before their occurrence and may evidence the presence of a stressful experience, given that people have to draw on resources to cope with demands, which they would not \"normally\" have to (Gaspar, Barnett, & Seibt, 2015) . This is the case with unexpected and potentially stressful events associated with the emergence of health threats (e.g. epidemics, biological and chemical contamination of food), terrorist attacks, natural disasters (e.g. hurricanes, floods), industrial accidents (e.g. nuclear) or even sudden events related with macroeconomic changes, that may come to be perceived as crisis. Reactions during these events can evidence collective sense-making (Gilles et al., 2013) , supportive actions (Murthy, 2013; Panagiotopoulos, Bigdeli, & Sams, 2014) , social sharing of emotions and empatic concerns for affected individuals (Neubaum, R\u20ac osner, Rosenthal-von der P\u00fctten, & Kr\u20ac amer, 2014) and individual strategies of approach/avoidance (Jonas et al., 2014) , that would be less prevalent in non stressful situations with lower demands to cope with. In this context, opinion mining and sentiment analysis techniques can be deployed to support response coordination (Purohit et al., 2013) or provide information about which audiences might be affected by emerging risk events (Lachlan, Spence, & Lin, 2014) .",

Moreover, these perceptions may change over time, along the chain of events that might occur -the hazard sequence (Barnett & Breakwell, 2003) .

Looking into these functions can allow for an assessment of: 1) how the overall situation is perceived e as a threat or challenge e and 2) the individual and social resources that individuals experience to have, to cope with demands. To identify these two aspects, we adopted the classification scheme by Skinner, Edge, Altman, and Sherwood (2003) , which lists 12 higher-order categories or families of coping and three higher-order adaptive function categories. The framework was applied on a Twitter dataset collected in Germany during the 2011 EHEC outbreak in Europe (Escherichia coli contamination of food incident). Food-related crises like contamination incidents tend to generate substantial reactions from the concerned public, which can escalate in unusual ways on social media (Mou & Lin, 2014; Rutsaert et al., 2013) . The first cases of EHEC contamination in the food chain were identified in Germany in May 2011, but it was not until July 2011 that the original source was identified and eliminated. Uncertainty over the source and extent of the contamination amplified public reaction and had severe economic and political impact, due to an incorrect attribution of blame to Spanish cucumbers as the original contaminated product (Gaspar et al., 2014) .",

Popular sentiment analysis techniques like SentiStrength classify messages as having a positive or negative \"tone\" based on whether they contain at least one positive or negative keyword (e.g. Kramer, Guillory & Hancock, 2014; Thelwall et al. 2011) . Strength of the identified sentiment depends on keyword frequencies, co-occurrences or a predefined assignment on specific words. Identification of affective valence and monitoring of the volume of relevant messages is important to overview public reactions and track changing sentiment during unexpected events e even at near real time. This can allow for example to determine whether negative sentiment is predominant over positive and infer that a problem to deal with may exist.",

Nevertheless, even different emotions within the same valence category e in this case the negative e can result from markedly different assessments of the situation and be predictive of divergent reactions during the event (Lerner & Keltner, 2000) . For example, expressions based on anger or fear might be classified as equally negative although they reflect fundamentally different emotional states and potential actions. More importantly, people's associated responses can have both desired (protective behaviour, emotion regulation, etc.) or undesired consequences (risk perception amplification, rumour spreading, etc.) (Neubaum et al., 2014; Oh, Agrawal, & Rao, 2013) .",

As events unfold, changes in affect, cognitions and behaviour patterns can be observed (Chew & Eysenbach, 2010) , as for example: rise in citizens' negative sentiment (Wong & Sam, 2010) , in a threat(s) perceived severity and risk perception (Terpstra, de Vries, Stronkman, & Paradies, 2012) and in the behaviours implemented to minimize/mitigate the threat(s) (e.g. Wong & Sam, 2010) . Also, positive or negative expressions do not necessarily translate as \"good\" or \"bad\" (Lerner & Keltner, 2000) . For example, there might be evidence of increases in positive sentiment (e.g. humour, irony), depending on the nature of the events and on how serious the issues are perceived (e.g. Chew & Eysenbach, 2010) . Positive in this context might not necessarily be good. For example, using humour may imply a positive accommodation of the stressful event(s), based on a cognitive restructuring of the situation, so that it is perceived as more positive. However, it may also imply a denial of the perceived threat, which may become a barrier to adopting the necessary protective behaviours (Skinner et al., 2003) . Similarly, negative affect may also serve a specific function that is not inherently \"negative\" and in need of being \"eliminated\". For example, moderate levels of anxiety and fear might motivate individuals to implement the necessary protective behaviours to minimise or eliminate the risks associated with a certain threat(s) (see e.g. Smith & McCloskey, 1998; Weinstein, 1988) . In addition, negative and positive sentiment are not mutually exclusive, as expressions of both can co-occur (Frydenberg, 2014) .",

Each of these responses can be classified in one of 12 coping families (layer 3) that serve one specific function (layer 2) as part of a more general adaptation process (layer 1). For example, when an individual experiences loss of control due to potentially stressful events and perceives the demands as being higher than the resources available to cope, the individual appraises that a threat/to self and/ or others exists (layer 1). This may lead to experiencing Helplessness (layer 3) that may be manifested in feelings of self-doubt, discouragement and/or guilt (layer 4) due to the individual perceiving that there are limits to the actions (layer 2) that can be implemented to cope with the threat. However, upon the same experienced loss of control, the individual may perceive having the necessary (individual and/or social) resources to cope, thus appraising the situation as a challenge to cope with. This may imply responding through Accommodation (layer 3) manifested in feelings of acceptance (layer 4) of the \"new state of things\", in order to adjust her/his preferences to the available options (layer 2). Although both types of affective expressions may be determined by the same control loss appraisal, they imply fundamentally different adaptive functions. Helplessness implies a focus on the individual's resource limits to cope with the situation (first adaptive function category e layer 1). Accommodation implies a focus on adjusting the individual's preferences, needs, etc. to the situation and available options, rather than changing the situation itself (third adaptive function category e layer 1). Moreover, both imply different appraisals of the same situation/events: threat vs. challenge respectively.",

Hence, we believe it is useful for monitoring reactions to unexpected and potentially stressful social events, as in the case of emergent social crisis. By assessing affective expressions following this framework, we can infer: 1) how the overall situation is perceived e as a threat or challenge (Blascovich & Mendes, 2001) e and 2) if people draw on individual and/or social resources to cope. More specifically, it is our contention that this framework can be applied to determining when, upon the same event(s), both a person and a larger group (society; nation; ...) experience stress and perceive a threat or challenge to cope with. Social media channels present themselves as a rich source of expressions of coping with demands. Twitter in particular can be considered a good source of affective expressions due to the quick, spontaneous and affective reactions found there, thus allowing access to the \"time course of emotional responses to crises\" (Spence, Nelson, & Lachlan, 2010, p.13) . Moreover, individuals can both influence and be influenced by the perceptions of other individuals (i.e. by their social context) and share resources of various forms (e.g. links, photos, videos, and experience from the grounds) (Murthy, 2013) . As a result, the framework can serve as a basis for theory-driven analysis of reactions to unexpected and potentially stressful social event(s) as perceived by individuals, by analysing individual's affective expressions of coping. Details of our application of the framework to the 2011 EHEC outbreak in Europe are presented next.",

Hence, from the 14 231 social media posts produced during this time, we excluded: messages from social media channels other than Twitter; tweet duplications (the same tweet published more than twice per day), retweets and unedited retweets and tweets that were not from individuals (e.g. news agencies). This allowed a focus on messages produced by individuals during the crisis.

Tweets were coded in a number of categories following a theory-driven (top down) approach and closed coding. This included the 12 coping families and the three adaptive function categories proposed by Skinner et al. (2003) but only considering the affective dimension, as presented in Fig. 1 . 1 First, we coded the data based on the lower order categories or ways of coping associated with the 12 higher order coping families; and secondly based on the three higher order adaptive function categories. The complete list of tweets was manually coded according to the lower order classification by two independent coders (for similar approaches, see e.g. Spence, Lachlan, Lin, & del Greco, 2015) . In a first stage of this process, both coders individually familiarised themselves with the dataset. A joint training stage then followed in which 100 tweets were coded together in order to assure a common understanding of the classification system. In the subsequent stage, both raters coded the complete data set and the level of inter-rater agreement (Cohen's Kappa) between the two data sets was checked. Results showed a high level (k \u00bc .75; SE \u00bc .017) of inter-rater agreement after this training stage.

However, in order to perform a more objective coding process, our decision was to code messages that only provided enough information to assess the context in which the message was shared with other users, i.e. that could be clearly codable in one of the 12 coping families, thus evidencing the goal underlying the message sharing. 4 The examples found next are in the translated form. The original tweets in \"To traveling friends: be aware. Big outbreak of dangerous foodborne E. coli bacteria already affects 1534 people in DE http:// bit.ly/jeCoDH\" [257] This implied concern that these people could find themselves in the affected geographical area and thus, be at risk. This concern also included people who were not informed about the situation, i.e. people who were abroad and who would visit the country in the near future. Differently, other expressions implied raising confidence in people, through messages conveying confidence and trying to have a minimizing effect associated with the events unfolding. This confidence was mainly produced in humorous messages, which attempted to \"play\" with the situation and thus experience the situation in a more positive way:",

For example, expressions of anger, which may be seen as simply irrational, could have actually been an attempt to improve the situation. Often, these expressions were not unspecific \"bursts\" of anger but rather targeted at institutions perceived as responsible for eliminating or mitigating the threat (e.g. health authorities or Germany, respectively). This could involve for example expressing anger towards authorities for not finding the source of the outbreak and/or the contaminated products which, if provided, could be relevant information for people to know what products to avoid or wash. Other forms of expressing anger could have included for example the goal of stimulating the online community, the scientific community, the authorities or anyone with interest in the issue, to deliberate and rethink basic questions that could help managing the ongoing crisis or even prevent such crises in the future.

One particular concern that may be raised is about the validity of interpretations made. According to Lund (2005) : \"Validity refers to the approximate certainty of the truth of an inference or knowledge claim, where inference is taken in a broad sense so as to encompass interpretations and generalisations.\" Validity concerns apply not only to qualitative analysis but also to quantitative analysis of sentiment and therefore, can be found across the social media analysis field. In our approach, this validity was assured on one side by following a theory-driven/top-down approach to data coding, analysis and interpretation, based on a well-established framework in the coping literature (Skinner et al., 2003) . On another side, this was assured by following validity procedures for qualitative data analysis, namely the independent coding by different judges and the coding validation; and the language/cultural meaning maintenance assurance by German native speakers. These validity concerns should however be a concern to any approach taken e either computer based or human based e and be implemented irrespectively of it. As Boyd and Crawford (2012; p. 667) referred: \"(\u2026) working with Big Data is still subjective, and what it quantifies does not necessarily have a closer claim on objective truth e particularly when considering messages from social media sites. But there remains a mistaken belief that qualitative researchers are in the business of interpreting stories and quantitative researchers are in the business of producing facts. In this way, Big Data risks re-inscribing established divisions in the long running debates about scientific method and the legitimacy of social science and humanistic inquiry\".",

In this, it is unclear whether the person is reporting trust in authorities or rather showing distrust in a sarcastic way. Nevertheless, it is our contention that this is a stronger limitation for computer based assessments. Indeed, while this may be identified as possible sarcasm trough a human based assessment, it would not be identified as such through a computer analysis. Still, both approaches are limited in this regard, thus making salient the need to implement new methods to increase coding validity, for example increasing the number of independent coders and including a human validation step in computer based analysis.

Arguably, sentiment analysis and monitoring of stressful and unexpected events, can support effective communication strategies and interventions. As shown in the qualitative sentiment analysis presented in this paper, individuals perceived the EHEC contamination incident as either a challenge or a threat and their corresponding ways of coping were identified (e.g. concern for others; optimism in its resolution; acceptance of the \"new state of things\"). Information such as this can be useful for crisis communicators and managers to understand reactions and adapt their strategies to increase individuals' resources for the implementation of pre-emptive actions. This can allow framing the potentially stressful situation/events as a challenge and potentiate their adaptive coping strategies (Skinner et al., 2003) , thus reducing their distress level. It is therefore important to consider the lessons to be learnt from this analysis across the different stages of a social crisis (see Sellnow & Seeger, 2013 for different models that determine crisis stages).",

At this stage, communication strategies focused on allowing people to perceive a challenge rather than a threat could allow for anger management and potentially its reduction. Given the high level of uncertainty during the initial stage of the EHEC crisis, such changes were more evident towards the last days of the events (see Fig. 2 ). Further to understanding and potentially managing transitions between people's emotional state, the added value of this approach can be also be evident in the future planning of similar events. Evaluations of the handling of the crisis and lessons for the future might even become part of individuals' expressions, hence fostering openness and learning that might not be possible using automated sentiment classification methods.",

Accordingly, further studies are needed with different case studies. This can provide knowledge about which ways of coping are specific and which are used across situations/events. Future work can also examine the effectiveness of intervention strategies in more detail, particularly in social crises when guiding attention to specific actions can have a direct effect (e.g. weather emergencies or public unrest). It should be noted however that social media analysis may only provide a partial view and thus, complementary data collection methods and additional \"layers\" of data should be used (for an example, see Neubaum et al., 2014) .",

This type of research allows assessing how individuals cope with unexpected events by drawing on existent resources. This was evident for example in tweets implying that individuals were drawing on social resources, for example expressing concern for others or finding limitations in the social resources available, expressing self-pity or whining for example, as a way of potentially increasing those resources (making their needs \"visible\"). While the former way of coping implies that people appraise the hazard more as a challenge than a threat, the opposite is true for the latter. This information that people are appraising as a threat and do not perceive having resources to cope, should determine authorities to provide social resources (e.g. product recalls; specific information for risk avoidance; identify the outbreak origin, affected products and/or the people/entities responsible for it) and allow them to be perceived as a trusted source/provider of these resources. Through this, people could potentially reframe the situation as a challenge rather than a threat. Indeed, trust in authorities and other stakeholders is a key aspect of risk and crisis communication (Lofstedt, 2013) . However, it is worrisome that no examples of expressions of trust were found in our qualitative analysis but rather expressions of distrust. This may indicate that people expressing it, perceived the situation/events as a threat to cope with and that the authorities were not perceived as a social resource that they could draw upon to cope, in this particular EHEC crisis. This is a challenging aspect for crisis communications that requires further work to understand how trust may evolve throughout the different crisis stages as events unfold.",

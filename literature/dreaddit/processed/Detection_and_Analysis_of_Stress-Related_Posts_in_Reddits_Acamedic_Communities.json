Automatic stress detection in text can proactively help manage stress and protect mental well-being. In today's digital era, social media platforms reflect various communities' psychological well-being and stress levels. This study focuses on detecting and analyzing stress-related posts in Reddit's academic communities. Due to online education and remote work, these communities have become central for academic discussions and support. We classify text as stressed or not using natural language processing and machine learning classifiers, with Dreaddit as our training dataset containing labeled Reddit data.\nNext, we collect and analyze posts from various academic subreddits. We identified that the most effective individual feature for stress detection is the Bag of Words, paired with the Logistic Regression classifier, achieving a 77.78% accuracy rate and an F1 score of 0.79 on the pre-labeled DReaddit dataset. To validate our model's applicability to detect stress in the specific context of academia, we conducted a supplementary experiment by manually annotating 100 posts from academic subreddits, achieving a 72% accuracy rate.\nOur key findings reveal that the overall stress level in academic texts is 29%. Posts and comments in professors' Reddit communities are the most stressful compared to other academic levels, including bachelor's, graduate's, and Ph.D. students. This research contributes to our understanding of the stress levels within academic communities. It can help academic institutions and online communities effectively develop measures and interventions to address this issue.",

Many text-based approaches for stress detection were proposed, and some of them identified that the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) with attention mechanism is the most effective approach [28] , [31] . The other study focuses on continuous lexical embedding and the BLSTM model [32] . Another study introduces the KC-Net, a mental state knowledge-aware and contrastive network effective for early stress detection [33] . A light and robust method to detect depressive texts in social media was proposed in [34] . The authors used an attention-based bidirectional LSTM and CNN-based model. Some works focus on applying the SVM-based approach [35] , achieving the 0.75 accuracy. To increase classification accuracy, some approaches combine lexicon-based features with distributional representations [30] . The other work proposes a TensiStrength method to identify the stress or relaxation level in the text, it applies a lexical approach and a set of rules [36] .",

During the preprocessing stage, various necessary adjustments were made to prepare the text data for ML classification. The preprocessing steps applied to the dataset are as follows (see Figure 4 ): 1) Lowercase: All text data has been converted to lowercase to ensure consistency and uniformity of references. 2) Removal of non-characters: Removed non-characters, such as letters and special characters, from the text data: removing HTML tags, ''@'', ''_'', and other special characters. This step helps eliminate unnecessary noise and information. 3) Tokenization: The text was tokenized using a tokenizer, which splits the text into individual tokens. This step is necessary to divide the text into basic units. 4) Stopword Removal: Common English stopwords (e.g., ''and'', ''the'', ''in'') are removed from the tokenized text. Grammatical terms are often discarded because they have no special meaning for classification tasks. 5) Stemming: The stem process was used to reduce the remaining words to their original form. This helps form similar words and simplifies vocabulary. Together, these preprocessing steps improve the quality and usability of the texture data, making it more suitable for subsequent ML classification tasks. The difference between raw and processed data can be seen in Fig. 5 .",

To get an idea of the key factors contributing to academic stress, we performed topic modeling, and the results can be seen in Figure 13 . For identifying topics, we used the BERT language representation model [55] . BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a comprehensive tool for analyzing short texts with little context and is less timeconsuming. We can see what kinds of words are frequently used together, and it gives us a little understanding of topics mostly discussed on Reddit posts and comments that can be considered as stressed. The posts and comments about studying and classes, professors and their English skills, major IT companies and internships, and sleep resonate the most with stress among bachelor students. Balancing jobs and education, research, and defense of a master's dissertation probably are stressful for graduate students. Research and supervisors, working, mental health and therapy, and talking to big audiences at conferences are topics mostly associated with stress among Ph.D. students. Everything connected with teaching and students, answering their questions, grading them, classes, and responding to emails is stressful for professors. Some sample students' posts (or comments) classified as stressed and unstressed are presented in Figure 14 .",

Specifically, there are noticeable spikes in stress for all levels of academia, which coincides with months (December and May) when exams are usually conducted. Bachelor students' stress levels remain relatively stable throughout the academic year except in October, and stress levels are lower during summer. It may appear that bachelor students experience less stress compared to other academic levels, but this is mostly due to the smaller size of the parsed Reddit dataset used for analysis.",

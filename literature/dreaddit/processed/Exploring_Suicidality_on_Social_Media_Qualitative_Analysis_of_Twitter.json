We collected suicide related tweets using 4 sets of key terms provided in 5 previous studies, followed by qualitative analysis of 8,000 randomly selected tweets. We found a total of 30 categories, which were grouped into three major themes: issues that are related to personal, interpersonal, and societal. Everyday issues, including emotions and relationships were most abundantly discussed through the lens of personal (36%) and interpersonal (14%) perspectives. Individuals also expressed suicidality when discussing diverse societal issues (50%), such as health and politics, and show the importance of the well-being of the general public to suicidality at the individual level.",

Even more concerning than the number of suicides per year is the rate at which suicide is increasing. The total suicide rate in the US rose 31% from 2001 to 2017 [4] . The rate reflects an increase in suicides among both genders [14, 24] . In 2018, suicide rates increased in every state, except Nevada [7] . Studies have shown that the rates are higher for men, non-Hispanic whites, less educated people, and children associated with poverty [4] , [8] , [9] . Due to the increase in suicides, the number of individuals who are engaged in self-harming behavior or dealing with suicidal ideation is becoming more important to researchers [10] . The suicide rate is growing over time and it needs to be addressed to minimize its effect.",

Despite there being no clear conclusion to social media's effects, 89% of teens surveyed by the Pew Research Center stated they were online several times a day or almost constantly [13] .

Suicidal users, whether or not engaging in self-harm activities, are found to be negatively influenced by forums or sites dedicated to sharing tips on methods, concealment of harmful behavior, graphic imagery, and pro-suicide propaganda [15, 35] . It has also been asserted that users that purposefully search for self-harm related or risky content online are more likely to exhibit suicidal behaviors and be involved in communities of users who are also involved in self-harming behaviors [3, 4, 36-39, 41, 56] . Therefore, knowing the suicide related content available or search results relating to suicide on a site could be valuable. Additionally, exposure to cyberbullies is linked to increasing suicidal behaviors [26] . Exposure to celebrity deaths also seems to influence negative behavior. One study found a higher frequency in posting and more negativity within posts in the time periods immediately following celebrity deaths [37] . Conversely, some suicidal users are positively influenced by finding a sympathetic community and resources for seeking help [15, 35] . Another study found that users who are experiencing greater levels of ideation and are at an increased risk for self-harm are more likely to seek out negative, suicide focused materials; whereas, lower-risk users are less likely to specifically search for suicide related content. Furthermore, higher risk individuals avoid beneficial content related to improving their mental health [27] . Finally, social media supports interaction with others, which may include suicidal individuals. Users become less suicidal when interacting with others that share an understanding of their feelings and encourage them to seek help; this is particularly true for users facing isolation in the real world [28] . It is still not completely understood whether engaging in online communication regarding mental health will lead to deeper ideation for users or sparking ideation in others [12, 54] . Using the knowledge of how suicidal users interact with the internet, researchers are hoping to adopt strategies to combat their feelings and provide them with the necessary assistance.",

                "text": "Many studies have used Twitter as a specific platform for examining suicidality on social media [21] , [40] - [51] . The American Psychological Association defines suicidality as \"the risk of suicide, usually indicated by suicidal ideation or intent, especially as evident in the presence of a well-elaborated suicidal plan\" [52] Suicidal users are more likely than the general population to post suicidal content [40] . This allows investigators to use language to identify risk factors and group tweets suspected of being indicative of suicidal ideation [47] . Through the use of machine learning and regression analyses, experts can differentiate between suicidal and non-suicidal tweets and users [41] , [51] . In addition, researchers can categorize the tweets by concern levels, which could help lead to further investigation of the users [49] . Moreover, research suggests that users experiencing suicidal ideation are likely to be involved in similar communities, proliferating tweets related to suicidal content [45] . This means that suicidal users are more likely than non-suicidal users to have other suicidal users following them and re-tweeting their messages [10, 43] . Furthermore, they are more likely to post content if they identify with a mental health group at a higher risk for suicidal behavior. This was observed in a study where researchers tracked the frequency of suicide related posts of self-identified Schizophrenic Twitter users. This research lays a foundation for identifying particular groups and people who might be more likely to suffer from suicidal ideation.",

Second, after using Twitter's application programming interface to collect tweets, coders conduct a manual review to confirm appropriateness of the dataset and to begin categorization [49] , [51] . Finally, some researchers pre-define terms in order to create training datasets, which will be utilized within various computational techniques [45] , [50] . There are limitations to each of these methods. Inadequate keyword selection may cause datasets to be filled with a higher than intended percentage of irrelevant content. Additionally, manual classification is time consuming and not scalable. Finally, the use of pre-defined labels may not allow the datasets to be holistically representative of the subject; missing labels may be unique to the social media platform or may have an influential but rare association to the subject matter.",

We employed the API Tweepy and used keywords taken directly from the previous studies to collect relevant datasets representing suicidality and filter out data as described in respective manuscripts. We independently executed the collection process for each set of terms, and they were concurrently collected for 4 weeks from October 4, 2019 to October 31, 2019. For each set of search terms, we randomly selected 1,000 original tweets generated from the first 2 weeks of data retrieval and another 1,000 from the second half of the 4 weeks. Therefore, for each of the four sets of terms, we separately analyzed 2000 tweets total. Overall, we analyzed 8,000 tweets.

All tweets were examined multiple times to confirm that each tweet was labeled appropriately and with all possible labels. Labels that referenced suicide in a nonliteral manner were included within the 'Suicide Reference' grouping (e.g., 'Career, Economic, Political, Spiritual Suicide').

The labels were separated by whether their associated subject matters were conceptually viewed by the readers as positive, negative, or neutral regarding suicidality. Our concept of polarity was driven by wanting to know the overall intention behind the messages and their designated labels. We classified labels that were associated with tweets highlighting hope, suicide prevention, and awareness as positive. Negative labels referenced suicidal ideation, regret, completed suicides, suicide as acts of violence, methods, and calls for self-harm. Neutral labels were associated with tweets related to suicide facts, news, or general information, and nonliteral references to suicide.

Tweets with indirect suicide references did not concretely mention suicide but intimate the user deals with ideation. The tweet may have been as follows: \"what if I never woke up again?\" We defined an 'Incidental Suicide Reference' as a reference to the user taking their own life, not due to a desire to die, but rather an accident. For example, \"I'd be so scared in a situation like that. I'd probably accidently kill myself.\" The remaining 1% of tweets (n=67) were labeled possible, for tweets with potential ideation; these were unclear due to missing context. Table II summarizes the number of 'Suicide Reference' and 'Noise' related tweets, by the 1000 tweet datasets created from the search terms. We recorded a total of 179 labels. Table III provides examples of how the tweets were labeled, especially with consideration to having multiple labels per tweet. We did not implement a limit to the number per tweet; however, our results included a minimum of 1 label and a maximum of 15 labels. We sorted the labels into 30 categories. The number of tweets associated with each category ranged from 38 ('Life and Death') to 3359 ('Feelings'). After establishing the categories, we ensured each tweet was distinctly labeled as a 'Suicide Reference' or 'Noise'.

It is important to note that we originally used Personal as a label for users who referenced suicidality pertaining to themselves. The Interpersonal theme encompassed categories that show interaction between multiple people. The Societal theme grouped together content related to society. There were 8,179 Personal tweets, 3,274 Interpersonal tweets, and 11,376 Societal tweets (Table IV ). These totals are higher than the reviewed tweet amount (i.e., 8,000) because the categories were not mutually exclusive and there were often multiple categories and labels per tweet. Only the groupings 'Suicide Reference' and 'Noise' were mutually exclusive, but they were not included in the theme consideration. Possible was excluded from the sort. Table V provides examples of some of the more prominent categories. Within the table, a count, theme, and definition of an example label for the chosen categories are included. Table III demonstrates how we labeled each tweet; Table V demonstrates how we defined categories and placed them into the broader themes. 'Suicide Focus' is Personal because associated tweets describe why users suffer from ideation. 'Health' is Societal because tweets reference topics that have an impact beyond the user and the user's relationships. Interpersonal includes categories that are contingent upon relationships between multiple people. For example, every tweet falling within 'Negative Relationships' details an adverse interaction between two or more people. Some categories (i.e., 'Suicide Focus', 'Feelings', 'Communication') diverge into sub-categories. The category 'Suicide Focus' (n=2628) incorporated labels that were defined by users' concentration on suicide within their messages. These messages expressed beliefs, risk, or history related to suicide. This category was further sorted into 4 sub-categories: 'Status' (n=1421), 'Ideology' (n=40), 'Against' (n=317), and 'Efforts' (n=850). 'Status' tweets discussed a user's current inclinations towards suicide or suicidal ideation. 'Ideology' tweets provided insight into what a user believes the reasons or purpose for suicide. 'Against' tweets pertained to a user's stance against suicide. 'Efforts' tweets contained information about a user's past or future attempts, including methods or regrets.",

The identified 30 categories were grouped into these themes, because issues were centered at those interaction levels. The themes were frequently discussed in the order of Societal, Personal, and Interpersonal. Although the users are creating the tweets, which is Personal by the nature of using social media, the outward interactions could also overtake the attention to self and the desire for suicide prevention and awareness. Therefore, tweets associated with Personal often had secondary labels that were associated with Societal (e.g., \"I'm sad ['Emotions'; Personal] about their politics ['Political'; Societal] but I'm going to the movies ['Entertainment'; Societal] to forget about it\"). Interpersonal possibly had the least number of tweets, because when relationships with others were described, the tweets generally included information about how the interactions affected them, leading to Personal labels. These patterns are partially reflected in literature regarding the linguistic style of suicidal individuals, which has been found to differ from nonsuicidal individuals [56] , [57] . Suicidal users are more likely to initiate messages on social media rather than replying to another user's posts, rely heavily on first person pronouns, and have global attributions [58] .",

From our data, we found 5 potential explanations. First, the use of various forms of the word \"death is pervasive in American English phrases (e.g., \"dead wrong,\" \"deadlock,\" \"Work is killing me,\"), which inflated the 'Death Reference' counts. Second, the datasets focus on suicide will make many tweets deeply personal (e.g., \"Depression had gotten me. I was having suicidal thoughts\"). Third, many tweets that were not about suicide still had references to mental health. Users' emotional states were often connected to their conversations on mental health (e.g., \"You can feel a breakdown coming. I zone out, get irritable, I can feel myself spiraling. And all I can do is watch and wait\"). Fourth, although the act of suicide is personal, there are many relational factors that increase or decrease risk of suicidality, including: ideation resulted from another person, interpersonal bonds that keep someone from committing suicide, and human desire to connect to another human. Finally, 'Political' may have persisted because the user population is represented by many Americans, and we live in a time when politics seem to permeate nearly every topic. Issues pertaining to farmers, military veterans, and LGBTQ citizens often focused on the particular populations elevated suicide risk and included language relating to legislation or political leanings (e.g., \"President X created millions more jobs then President Y threw a tantrum and farmers started committing suicide\"). We found many of the phrases that include the term suicide but are not meant to express literal suicidality (i.e., \"political suicide\", \"economic suicide\") within tweets that had a political tone (e.g., \"Senator X helped lead their political party to political suicide\"). Other phrases driving the interconnection between politics and suicide include metaphorical and literal attacks caused by politics (e.g., \"Senator Z went on a suicide mission. Everybody dies.\"). Politics was even included in tweets identified as noise (e.g., \"You tricked me into learning more about a politician.",

Previous literature computationally detecting suicidality using Twitter largely neglected this aspect of suicide discussion [47] , [59] . Understanding that movement against suicide showcases that not every conversation regarding suicide must be problematic or considered a sign of suicidality. Additionally, we found a large number of neutral labels (30%), which included categories such as 'Solution', 'Personal' and 'Jokes'.

Social media users range in age groups, meaning there are a variety of speech patterns and colloquial terms. \"I'm dead\" is a phrase commonly used by younger people to represent disbelief or finding humor in a situation. It does not represent literal death and usually is not used with an overly negative tone. This indicates that not every tweet captured our intended content. We included tweets that were collected because a search term served as slang in our 'Suicide Reference' grouping. However, when focusing on true suicidality, tweets composed using slang in a manner that lacks suicidality can be removed from analysis. When dealing with language and the culture surrounding social media sites, there will be unrelated posts, despite efforts to minimize noise. Our qualitative finding suggests that, on average, 68% of tweets from the four sets of search and filter terms were noise. One major reason for noise is that negative emotions or thinking, which are represented by some of the search terms, do not always equate to suicidality. We found many tweets that showed risk factors, such as depression, without any expression of suicidality (e.g., \"Dear PM my depression comes from your response to climate change and other issues. Your threat to young people is unacceptable.\"). We consider this noise because we were specifically looking for any indication of suicidality.

Numerous tweets did not have any easily identified search terms (e.g., \"Can't be tamed better than both\"). Some tweets indirectly referenced death and may have been retrieved because phrases like \"rest in peace\" often relate to death (e.g., \"I hope justice will be served and bodies returned to their families so they can finally rest in peace.\"). These did not refer to suicide. There were tweets that included the term death, but did not reference suicide (e.g., \"How dead do they need their enemies to be?\"). In fact, it was possible for a tweet at this association level to express the urgency of life (e.g., \"Something that's not growing is dead. No? Life is urgent\"). Finally, there were instances of noise, referencing the user's death, but without the notion of real selfharm (e.g., \"Me playing dead in pools when I was little to see if anyone would care\"). Any reference to death caused by selfharm, even if it was not the user's, was marked as a Suicide Reference (e.g., \"Sayn just made a joke about Etika's Suicide\"). Therefore, search term sets that utilized terms that were less specific to suicide may have unintentionally extracted tweets that were important to mental health but did not definitively showcase suicidality, due to the unknown history of the individuals. Based on our analysis, we found a lesser number of users focused on suicide, and a greater number of users focused on other mental health issues, coping methods, emotional distress, and/or interpersonal interactions.",

If profiles for suicidal users are identified and specifically selected for data retrieval, data may better reflect the general population of suicidal persons [61] . Second, we found a large variation of topics that are all related to suicide. This shows that users with different interests and backgrounds have a chance to interact with suicidal content. It also increases the chances for inclusion of unintended or unwanted topics. Therefore, retrieval should be as specific as possible. Third, we found that context matters when distinguishing slang or jokes from warning signs. Decoding another person's words can be confusing without context because the same phrase can be used literally or nonliterally (e.g., I want to de right now). Context should be accounted for when gathering data on specific topics. Contextual data cleaning and machine learning can be used to reduce noise and identify appropriate content [62] - [65] .",

For example, based on our findings that death was referenced in over 25% of tweets, a focus could be on specifically finding messages that include the word \"dead\" in order to investigate which population is most likely to use it. A study could examine the context surrounding the usage and whether suicidal or nonsuicidal users are more likely to casually include similar language within their posts. In a second example, if the conversation surrounding suicide seems to correlate highly with current coping strategies but hardly at all with seeking help, then researchers can focus on identifying what coping strategies are frequently used, which strategies are most effective, the population associated with specific strategies. Conversely, researchers can purposefully explore low correlating topics that they believe are important. Continuing the example, a researcher may ask why more users are not seeking help and could try to evaluate which users could be persuaded to seek treatment based on the characteristics of the users willing to include references to getting help. Consequently, the conversations around suicide may become more nuanced. Essentially, researchers are able to identify specific populations, needs of pre-selected populations, or trends relating to particular users. If more beneficial and appropriate content was available, higher risk users may not avoid them as easily, exposing them to potentially lifesaving information [27] . If health practitioners could promote topics more precisely on social media, they may have a better chance of positively influencing users to seek out help when experiencing ideation [15] .",

If possible, in the future, access levels can be determined based on matching content with the risk profile of users.

As previously discussed, suicide is the second leading cause of death for teenagers and young adults [4] . Therefore, selecting Twitter as a platform for our research potentially helped us comprehend content uniquely reflective of that specific at-risk population. Our findings suggest, social media researchers should investigate the demographics of users of the study's chosen platforms and compare these demographics to national trends so that they can know how closely their results apply to the real-world population of suicidal individuals or if the users they are studying are distinct. Public health practitioners can also use these findings by understanding that each social media site may have a unique user population needing tailored services or interactions. This will be needed if populations differ in the effectiveness of various prevention strategies. For example, knowing Twitter users are generally younger, public health workers can discuss coping strategies that are most useful for younger individuals at a higher rate than they discuss strategies useful for middle age individuals.",

Suicide is a public health concern, and not only an individual's, as evidenced by the multitude of categories we identified, and the Interpersonal and Societal nature of many posts. Users were willing to discuss suicide in a range of topics. Public health workers may use this knowledge to post more freely and to encourage people to have open and honest conversations, without feeling burdened by previous levels of stigma. We found it difficult to determine suicidality risk level performing a manual review. However, as aforementioned, machine learning can be used to determine individual risk. A theoretical model, such as interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior could be the basis for evaluating risk. User's profiles would be reviewed to assess perceived burdensomeness, their sense of belongingness, and their ability to die by suicide [70] . Perhaps, if profiles for suicidal users are automatically identified, researchers can shift their focus from reviewing and determining warning signs to finding which measures are most effective at prevention. In other words, there is an opportunity for a paradigm shift in suicide research; the perspective can change from concentrating on what increases the chances of negative outcomes to what increases the chances of positive outcomes. In turn, experts participating in general conversation regarding suicide may also utilize positive dialogue, potentially increasing engagement levels of suicidal individuals.",

For example, we sorted the Trauma label into the 'Mental Health' category. 'Trauma' may also be considered a risk factor [71] - [76] . Similarly, categories may fall into multiple themes. 'Depression Reference' may be 'Personal' if the user is speaking on their own feelings of depression; or 'Interpersonal' if the user is speaking about caring for a family member that has depression. However, we encounter such cases only a few times, thus we grouped them based on which theme the majority of the categories best aligned. Second, we were not always able to determine the appropriate labels for subjective tweets, due to the complexity of the English language, as well as the inability to entirely comprehend tone. However, researchers can use our results to understand which topics Twitter users most closely associated with suicide and understand possible intent of users. Further, language is constantly changing, and slang is prevalent on social media, hindering complete understanding of some tweets [77] , [78] . In addition, social media sites, including Twitter, can foster a culture of trolling, a form of online harassment [79] . The harassers can go as far as threatening the lives of other users or encouraging others to commit acts of self-harm. The content of these tweets could potentially overlap with our search terms. Although we discuss this in terms of Twitter, these limitations apply to social media platforms in general. Third, our noise rate could be inflated, due to the fact we did not apply manual categorization [51] and machine learning classification [45] . Last, there were several nationally and globally recognized mental health and/or suicide events (e.g., National Mental Health Day (10/10/19), World Suicide Prevention Day (9/10/19)) occurring during the time period of our data collection. This could have skewed our numbers towards Suicide References and Societal tweets.",

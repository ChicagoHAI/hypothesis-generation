Individuals often use social media to discuss and share information, advice, and support related to post-college challenges in online communities. These communities are important as they fill gaps in institutional support between college and post-college plans. We empirically study the challenges and stress expressed on social media around this transition as students graduate college and move into emerging adulthood. We assembled a dataset of about 299,000 Reddit posts between 2008 and 2020 about the post-college transition from 10 subreddits. We extracted top concerns, challenges, and conversation points using unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Then, we combined the results of LDA with binary transfer learning to identify stress expressions in the dataset (classifier performance at F1=0.94). Finally, we explore temporal patterns in stress expressions, and the variance of per-topic stress levels throughout the year. Our work highlights more deliberate and focused understanding of the post-college transition, as well as useful research and design impacts to study transient cohorts in need of support.\nCCS Concepts: \u2022 Human-centered computing \u2192 Empirical studies in collaborative and social computing.",

Life transitions include leaving home, starting and ending relationships, getting a new job, getting married, or having children. These transitions alter individuals' sense of being, roles and responsibilities, and physical surroundings [37, 62] . In particular, the post-college transition is important as young adults face a crucial psychological maturation stage, struggling between the desire to meet expectations and come to terms with the realities of emerging adulthood [34] . Research has shown that this transition is punctuated with short-term stress and decreased wellbeing [34, 50, 62, 83] .",

Most university surveys of students focus on procedural outcomes, like graduation rates and employment placement, and not on well-being markers like stress and overall life satisfaction. Furthermore, the abrupt discontinuation of collegiate support caused by graduation means that there is an absence of formal support for the well-being of new graduates. This leaves many individuals in a proverbial \"no-man's land\" with ambiguous (and possibly absent) support and assistance [89] . This gap of care hinders longitudinal studies that may inform proactive interventions and support for individuals undergoing the post-college transition [62, 89] . What is needed, then, is an observational and comprehensive study of this transition to overcome these gaps.",

In RQ1, we use unsupervised topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) combined with human annotations to identify key challenges and thematic takeaways. In RQ2, we use transfer learning to build a classifier that identifies low and high stress posts, with performance at 0.94 F1. We find that temporal stress patterns correspond with both the academic school year, and that reported stress is increasing over time in our dataset (+29.64% year over year). Combining the topic models and stress classification together, we relate the challenges to stress over time. We find that specific post-college challenges exhibit different patterns of stress expression throughout the year.",

Our work contributes a taxonomy of the major concerns and challenges experienced by individuals undergoing post-college transition. Additionally, we offer methods contributions for filtering datasets on Reddit. This work can better inform on-campus stakeholders in their recent efforts to prioritize student health and well-being and to conduct tailored interventions and policy changes. Finally, we contribute to CSCW and HCI research in considering what ways online communities can fill the gaps of traditional support mechanisms for those in transition.",

Research on transitions is extensive in sociology and organizational studies, as transitions are an important life process. They alter the roles and responsibilities, surroundings, and sense of identity of individuals [34, 37, 62] . Mikal et al. identifies four main transitional domains: health-illness (individual), development (familial), organization (community), and situational (societal) [62] , whereas other frameworks rest on whether the life transition was anticipated or not [61] . In either framework, those in transition encounter both decreased well-being in the short-term and long-term personal growth [62] .",

The literature mostly takes two perspectivesanalyzing final year students (or college seniors) and their concerns as they search for post-graduate opportunities [49, 51] or evaluating students as they transition to gainful employment in private industry [50, 65] . Traditional approaches to understand these transitions include surveys and interviews [10, 89] . While these methods are accurate and provide deep insights, these approaches do not scale and are susceptible to biases caused by the difficulty of surveying a transient cohort [85] . Closest to our work, Wendlandt and Rochlen conducted a literature review highlighting the challenges associated with the college-to-work transition. They identified three stages of transition in this time period -anticipation, adjustment, and achievement and also proposed implications for career counselors [89] . A common theme in this research was the role of social support for a smooth transition and establishing a sense of well-being. Our work contributes to this area by providing insights into the major challenges during post-college transitions by using large-scale social media data.",

This is closely related to the notion of \"social support\" -the use of social resources like friends, family, and peers to provide a sense of belonging, reassurance, information, and connection with others [23, 48] . Social support helps individuals develop coping strategies from stressful events and assists with psychological adjustment [19, 60] . For students, social support can positively affect academic adjustment [29] . Online communities can be analogs of offline support groups, where individuals seek support through sensitive self-disclosures [26, 46] and receive support in return. De Choudhury and De showed that social media facilitates candid self-disclosures and drawing support related to mental health and stigma, and can help individuals connect with others who have had related experiences [26] .",

Users turn to social media to seek advice, diminish feelings of isolation, provide support, and to share coping strategies and experiences [66] . Social support can help manage transitional outcomes and stress [62] . For example, van Ingen et al. measured coping after negative life events and found a small positive association between social media use and problem-focused coping [86] . In times of life transitions, the Internet enables an individual to stay connected with established networks while bringing together new, relevant support networks, without relying on geographic proximity [62] . In the case of gender transition, social media can be both a source of stress because of sensitive information disclosure as well as a platform to help alleviate such stress by providing support from one's social network [40] . Burke and Kraut studied social media use following job loss and found that communication with strong ties was generally associated with positive effects, such as improvements in stress and social support, and increased likelihood of reemployment [12] . Closest to our research, DeAndrea et al. studied students transitioning from high school to college and found that social media gives students access to an online community and provides a means for students to give and receive help [29] .",

For college students, social media is a rich source of information, given their digital literacy and access [71] . The seminal work of Ellison et al. revealed the positive association between college students' social media use and maintenance of social capital [33] . Social media helps this demographic to satisfy their psychosocial needs [56] . In related work, Bagroy et al. not only found that Reddit college communities are also representative of the offline college communities but also can reveal population-scale mental wellbeing of college campuses [8] . Close to our work, Saha and De Choudhury quantified the severity of gun violence crises on college campuses using linguistic indicators and machine learning on social media data [78] . Another study revealed that stress expressions in online college communities increased after exposure to hateful speech [77] .",

Additionally, prir work has shown that Reddit facilitates candid disclosures through affordances and norms on its site, such as topical focus, anonymity with throwaway accounts, and community-driven moderation to maintain discussion quality [5, 6, 26, 87] , making it a great place to study the post-college transition.",

We leveraged r/LifeAfterSchool's curated list of over 400 related subreddits found in the subreddit's Wiki page [1] , and manually visited them all. To determine if subreddits primarily catered to the undergraduate college experience, two members of the research team designed a rating task. To be included, subreddits had to meet three criteria, inspired by prior work [8, 16, 78] : 1) the discussions were about undergraduate college experience; 2) there was at least one post in the last month when we gathered our data (April 2020); 3) the size of the subreddit was larger than 2,500 subscribers. Two researchers independently annotated whether a subreddit met these criteria and met to resolve disagreements. Most subreddits were cut for topical relevance (e.g. r/personalfinance is important for the postcollege transition but not focused on college specifically). We deliberated over whether to include specific industry (i.e. r/cscareerquestions) or admissions (r/lawschooladmissions or r/premed) subreddits. After more closely reading posts from these subreddits, we found that these subreddits featured posts across the career spectrum, from new hire to senior and management, and did not focus on post-college employment specifically. Table 1 shows our shortlist of 10 subreddits after this deliberation.",

To filter our dataset to more appropriately study post-college transitions, we used what we call a lexico-semantic similarity filter (LSSF) to specifically identify posts in this target group. LSSF leverages word embeddings, a popular and powerful technique from the natural language processing literature [63] . Word embeddings represent words as vectors in higher dimensional latent space, where words that are lexically or semantically similar tend to be closer in vector space [63, 70] . For instance, synonyms tend to appear near each other in embeddings. Within the word embedding vector space, linguistically similar words or documents can be estimated using distance measures [63] . We leveraged these benefits of word embeddings to find relevant discussions about post-college transitions from our 10 subreddits.",

These subreddits were selected for two reasons: r/Stress is a source of precise information on people who self-identify as being stressed and has been used in prior work for similar purposes [78, 80] . To tune our classifier to the experiences of college students, we identified and incorporated the data of two collegerelated subreddits, r/badroommates and r/CollegeRant, into the positive class labels. In transfer learning, complementary datasets have shown to improve transfer learning performance on the final task [16, 78] , and our experiments with this approach also showed the same.

For example, we saw the stress of being admitted to graduate programs lingered from Jan to April -the temporal analysis in RQ2 would not have shown this given its noticeable dip in stress during that time. Quantitative approaches and research on online communities often collapse representation across time into a singular setup, thereby losing temporal fidelity [13] . Our approach allows for a more fine-grained temporal study of the challenges of post-college transitions.

Finding specific experiences or details in large and broad subreddits is challenging, and can lead to substantial noise. Our high-dimensional word embedding of data known to be relevant to the post-college transition let us filter larger, less specific communities for our signal of interest.

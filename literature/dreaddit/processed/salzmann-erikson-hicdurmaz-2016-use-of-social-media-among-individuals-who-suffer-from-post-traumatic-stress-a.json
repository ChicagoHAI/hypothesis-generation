Regardless of the type of trauma, exposure therapy is considered to be a gold standard in achieving symptom reduction (Rauch, Eftekhari, & Ruzek, 2012) . Other well-documented treatment options are pharmacological therapy (Bastien, 2010) , group therapy, psychoeducation, and supportive counseling (Sloan, Bovin, & Schnurr, 2012) . Even though there are several treatment options, a newly published systematic review comprising more than 10,000 participants demonstrated that stable recovery in PTSD was detected only at a rate of 18% to 50% within 3 to 7 years (Morina, Wicherts, Lobbrecht, & Priebe, 2014) . The harmful effect of posttraumatic stress reactions on functionality makes recovery and rehabilitation difficult (Perkonigg et al., 2005) . However, having resilience factors that may reduce the risk or severity of PTSD can enable coping. Seeking out support from other people, such as friends and family, finding a support group after a traumatic event, feeling good about one's own actions in the face of danger, having a coping strategy or a way of getting through the bad event and learning from it, and being able to act and respond effectively despite feeling fear, are some of these resilience factors (Hundt et al., 2015; Karstoft, Armour, Elklit, & Solomon, 2013; National Institute of Mental Health, 2015) .",

                "text": "Research has shown that patients suffering from trauma strongly need to talk about the incident, and need social support (Hundt et al., 2015; Karstoft et al., 2013) . Psychotherapy, which is accepted by the National Institute of Mental Health (2015) as a kind of talk therapy, has been found to provide substantial improvement in patients (Hundt et al., 2015; Lee, Gavriel, Drummond, Richards, & Greenwald, 2002; Paunovic, & Ost, 2001; Resick, Nishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002) . Awareness of one's own psychological problems and searching for solutions for them, such as focused expressive writing (Smyth & Helm, 2003) and memory recalling (Boals, Banks, & Hayslip, 2012) , are types of self-care activities. Self-care is \"the practice of activities that individuals initiate and perform on their own behalf in maintaining life, health and well-being\" (Orem, 1995) . Making use of selfcare activities when suffering from PTSD, for example yoga (Libby, Reddy, Pilver, & Desai, 2012) and music therapy (Bensimon, Amir, & Wolf, 2008) , has been found to be useful in easing symptoms. However, the body of knowledge that addresses self-care activities via the use of social media for people suffering from PTSD is less developed. We hypothesize that an analysis of authentic narratives about PTSD will yield important insights about the life conditions of individuals who suffer from PTSD, and in addition, insights regarding their use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) to receive support. Therefore, this study aims to describe how individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress use social media to communicate authentic narratives of their life conditions.",

Inclusion criteria were (a) the material should originate from a publicly available venue, as the sample should not require any registration, login, or password to access and (b) the material should contain a first-hand experience from an individual with the experience of post-traumatic stress. Exclusion criteria were (a) professionals who lectured about PTSD; (b) children; (c) cloaked video recordings; (d) second-hand experiences/narratives that were not self-reports, that is relatives; (e) advertisements; (f) professional actors; and (g) directed role-plays (Figure 1 ). To obtain our purposeful sample, we carefully selected the sample based on the aim of the study. The intention was that the data should provide us with a unique and rich content. For example, posters differed in various aspects, such as types of experienced trauma (e.g., sexual harassment, car accident, childhood trauma, burglary, and war-related trauma), gender, ethnicity, ages, and seemingly different stages in the recovery process.",

As guided by the LiLEDDA method (Salzmann-Erikson & Eriksson, 2012) , the data from text-based webpages was copied and pasted into a separate Word document holding 109 pages. In addition, all the URLs to the raw data were filed in a spreadsheet, which enabled the researchers to go back and replay the material. Both researchers had access to the document holding the text-based data and the URL spreadsheet. The videos were repeatedly viewed and extensive notes were taken of the spoken words. In addition, notes were also taken about body language, gestures, and mimics, as well as other information about the recordings, such as the setting. To analyze the data, both researchers conducted line-by-line coding to tag and label segments (Miles & Huberman, 1994) . Conceptual codes and sub-codes were used to identify key concepts in the data (Bradley, Curry, & Devers, 2007) . The two researchers came to an agreement about the key concepts that would be presented as categories in the results. We constructed deductive questions that were based on the categories, for example \"What kinds of structures do the narratives contain?\" and \"What are the kinds of restrictions?\" From such deductive questioning based on our categories, we were able to go back to the data and more thoroughly ensure that all aspects in the data set were included in each category. Moreover, by doing so, we were able to compare their similarities and differences within the categories. Excerpts from posts were selected purposefully to display the content of each category. Because we cannot know that the posters had been specifically diagnosed with PTSD by a professional, we refer to their symptoms as \"post-traumatic stress,\" but we do sometimes refer to their PTSD in situations in which they explicitly refer to the diagnosis.",

A typical YouTube video was recorded in the private home, bedroom, or living room of the poster and the poster's webcam was used to record the video. Furthermore, the videos do not convey staged, directed, or professional recordings; rather the quality of audio and video is homemade.

Another key feature is that the posters narrate freely, as feelings, emotions, and experiences \"comes from the heart in the very moment.\" The majority of the posters only published one recording, which conveyed a full story, but some publishers had posted a series of recordings, more like a video blog, covering specific topics in relation to their illness in a sequential, date-hierarchical style. The structure of the text-based blogs was similar to that of the videos. In one blog introduction, the poster stated her problems briefly: I am a 25 year old woman and was diagnosed with Chronic PTSD last summer. I have always known from childhood that there was something wrong with me emotionally. I have always had problems with irritability, temper, and anxiety. I have a hard time expressing my anger, and panic over little things (like not being able to find a shoe, or burning dinner).",

The results demonstrate that individuals use social media via CMC to post narratives that address detailed descriptions of their life situation. Rejn\u00f6, Berg, and Danielson (2013) described narratives as \"retroactive constructions-representations of things that have happened\" (p. 619). The narratives displayed posters who were incapable of fully participating in society. However, the use of CMC facilitates participation in virtual discussions, as the posters are not only able to share their experiences but also can make use of the interactive features of the web-based platforms. As such, they are exchanging coping strategies in their everyday living, by using the commenting functions, which provide them with the ability to make sense of their own experiences through the dynamics of the communication styles (cf. Ziebland, 2004) . This exchange of coping strategies via online interactions highlights the occurrence of therapeutic group factors, such as altruism, interpersonal learning, and guidance. Even though we present the benefits of using social media, we think that the downsides are worth reflecting upon. When posting a disclosure text in public venues online, this is done without a safety net. In doing so, the poster has little control over how the text will be received, interpreted, and responded to. Buckels, Trapnell, and Paulhus (2014) described the \"Dark Tetrad\" of online personalities, referring to those who intentionally post provocative and harassing texts. Furthermore, anonymity may not be certain, as the detailed descriptions of a person's problems may be recognized by others in that person's offline, close surroundings, such as an employer or others who may use the information in a way that was not originally intended. Hence, the anonymity of the Internet may not be real, and instead of protecting the poster, it can involve offline risks and negative consequences.",

In our findings, we found that a certain structure could be obtained from the narratives and we interpret this structure as being grounded in causality thinking (cf. Trabasso & van den Broek, 1985) . The stories mostly originated from the trauma itself, but posters also provided an explanation for their sociocultural background, such as childhood conditions and/or their present societally bounded context. Moreover, the posters narrated their inability to participate in private and professional relationships, such as marriage and work. They related this to their being emotionally vulnerable and that they may be exposed to triggers that make them act in various ways that are not socially accepted. Even though society is becoming more liberated regarding alternative ways of living, and more individualized (Halman, 2009) , deviant behavior, such as that resulting from mental illness, is highly stigmatized (Livingston, Rossiter, & Verdun-Jones, 2011) .",

In concordance with our findings, research demonstrates that PTSD impairs occupational functioning through absenteeism, unemployment, and work disability (Alden, 2012; Banyard, Potter, & Turner, 2011; Heir, Piatigorsky, & Weisaeth, 2010) . On the other hand, unemployment because of avoidance can predict the persistence of PTSD symptoms. A study made after the collapse of the towers of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, revealed that unemployment at any time following the collapse predicted persistence of PTSD symptoms in individuals with PTSD (Nandi et al., 2004) . We stress this aspect as being especially problematic, as there is a nearconsensus in research on the recovery from mental illness regarding the importance of having work, participating in education, or being attached to similar occupations, to find hope and meaning in life (Agaibi & Wilson, 2005; Southwick, Gilmartin, MacDonough, & Morrissey, 2006) .",

Consistent with the accounts by the posters in our findings, recovery from mental illness and from psychiatric disabilities is often spoken of as a process that takes a long time, one that takes place over several years or decades (Romano, McCay, Goering, Zipursky, & Boydell, 2010; Slade, 2009) . Furthermore, Slade (2009) proposed viewing recovery as a journey in life and not as a final destination to reach. In this study, we argue for the benefit of participating in virtual discussions in the recovery process. Using Slade's analogy, when posters exchange narratives and support each other, they also become a fellow traveler on that journey. Davidson, O'Connell, Tondora, Lawless, and Evans (2005) held that recovery is not just the loss of symptoms, but rather a way of living a satisfying life that includes the symptoms. Such acceptance was also seen in our results. Slade's (2009) model of personal recovery conceptualized four key concepts: hope, identity, meaning, and responsibility. Participating in social and meaningful activities, such as education, support groups, and leisure activities, promotes and facilitates recovery from mental illness and such engagement prevents isolation and depression (Ramon, Healy, & Renouf, 2007; Rhoads, Pearman, & Rick, 2007; Sch\u00f6n, Denhov, & Topor, 2009) . Due to the impaired social ability and skills that are part of the range of symptoms among individuals with PTSD, we stress the value of engaging in virtual self-care activities.",

When first publishing their videos, they commonly stated that their intention in posting the video was to convey their story and experience, for the purpose of supporting others with similar conditions, conveying the message that \"you are not alone.\" During their online interactions, many of the responders revealed that the posters' stories helped them because they had thought that they were the only person living with this kind of experience and that nobody could help them. By taking advantage of online interactions, the posters and their audience change into a therapeutic group, and all the therapeutic factors outlined by Yalom (Yalom & Leszcz, 2005) start to emerge automatically. The first group of emerging therapeutic factors are universality, instillation of hope, catharsis, self-understanding, and existential factors. Of these factors, the two that are particularly remarkable are \"universality,\" which enables group members to realize that they are not alone in their experience and that there are people who are living with the same problems. Universality was, for example, visualized in the category of \"structure of the narrative,\" in which the posters conveyed a sense to the audience that \"you are not alone.\" Next, \"instillation of hope,\" which enables them to realize \"If there are people who cope with this, I can too.\" This therapeutic factor was, for example, present in the categories of \"strategies in the everyday living\" and \"online interactions.\" During these online interactions, we can also see some other therapeutic factors, such as altruism, identification, interpersonal learning, and guidance, which were, for example, present under the categories of \"strategies in the everyday living\" and \"online interactions.\" Within these categories, the posters and commentators identified with each other, learned from each other and provided guidance about \"talking to someone\" or \"taking therapy.\"",

However, as Kvale (1996) argues, in qualitative inquiries the number of participants is subordinate to other qualities. Hence, the important consideration is the relevancy and sufficiency of the data in meeting the purpose of the study. Due to our purposive sample, we argue that the included data set was rather voluminous, as we encountered repetition in the narratives. One limitation is that we cannot map the demography on the posters, as this might restrict the variety of data. Furthermore, selectivity is another methodological issue, as the posters we selected to be included have all voluntarily posted stories or comments. It could also be argued that the data overrepresented those individuals who have the resources, for example, the technical knowledge, the intellectual capabilities, the mental strength, and/or the economic resources, that are needed to communicate online. We agree that more thorough methods might have provided more in-depth insights. Such methods could be, for example, participant observation, including interaction with the posters to ask questions and verify hypotheses (Spradley, 1979) .",

Davis, Anthony, and Pauls (2015) stressed that online support conversations offer a unique environment in which to explore social structures. A netnographic study of naturally occurring interactions via CMC can enable both professionals and researchers to better understand individuals and their health care needs, and configure better helping strategies. Therefore, we argue that helping professionals should closely monitor and further explore the CMC activities and trends that are developing, and which with time are becoming important self-care resources for people using the Internet. On the other hand, posters may sometimes be in a state of crisis, attempting to extend their ability to cope via their self-care activities, and they may need professional support. In these types of situations, continuous monitoring of CMC by helping professionals comes into prominence, and opportunities for referral should be provided for individuals who are experiencing a crisis. The construction of official versions of these kinds of forums, maintained by professional organizations or universities, could be a good solution. In this way, the contact information of professionals or departments that are specialized in working with these types of crises could be provided on forum websites for acute help and referral. Providing this help via official organizations that are guided by strict regulations can also prevent confidentiality issues and provide support that may be totally or partially free from commercial concerns.",

With the popularity of social media, people are used to sharing their daily activities and interacting with friends on social media platforms, making it feasible to leverage online social network data for stress detection. In this paper, we find that users stress state is closely related to that of his/her friends in social media, and we employ a large-scale dataset from real-world social platforms to systematically study the correlation of users' stress states and social interactions. We first define a set of stress-related textual, visual, and social attributes from various aspects, and then propose a novel hybrid model -a factor graph model combined with Convolutional Neural Network to leverage tweet content and social interaction information for stress detection. Experimental results show that the proposed model can improve the detection performance by 6-9 percent in F1-score. By further analyzing the social interaction data, we also discover several intriguing phenomena, i.e., the number of social structures of sparse connections (i.e., with no delta connections) of stressed users is around 14 percent higher than that of non-stressed users, indicating that the social structure of stressed users' friends tend to be less connected and less complicated than that of non-stressed users.",

According to a worldwide survey reported by Newbusiness in 2010, 1 over half of the population have experienced an appreciable rise in stress over the last two years. Though stress itself is non-clinical and common in our life, excessive and chronic stress can be rather harmful to people's physical and mental health. According to existing research works, long-term stress has been found to be related to many diseases, e.g., clinical depressions, insomnia etc.. Moreover, according to Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide has become the top cause of death among Chinese youth, and excessive stress is considered to be a major factor of suicide. All these reveal that the rapid increase of stress has become a great challenge to human health and life quality.",

With the development of social networks like Twitter and Sina Weibo, 2 more and more people are willing to share their daily events and moods, and interact with friends through the social networks. As these social media data timely reflect users' reallife states and emotions in a timely manner, it offers new opportunities for representing, measuring, modeling, and mining users behavior patterns through the large-scale social networks, and such social information can find its theoretical basis in psychology research. For example, [7] found that stressed users are more likely to be socially less active, and more recently, there have been research efforts on harnessing social media data for developing mental and physical healthcare tools. For example, [27] proposed to leverage Twitter data for real-time disease surveillance; while [35] tried to bridge the vocabulary gaps between health seekers and providers using the community generated health data. There are also some research works [28] , [47] using user tweeting contents on social media platforms to detect users' psychological stress. Existing works [28] , [47] demonstrated that leverage social media for healthcare, and in particular stress detection, is feasible.",

First, tweets are limited to a maximum of 140 characters on social platforms like Twitter and Sina Weibo, and users do not always express their stressful states directly in tweets. Second, users with high psychological stress may exhibit low activeness on social networks, as reported by a recent study in Pew Research Center. 3 These phenomena incur the inherent data sparsity and ambiguity problem, which may hurt the performance of tweeting content based stress detection performance. For illustration, let's see a Sina Weibo tweet example in Fig. 1 . The tweet contains only 13 characters, saying that the user wished to go home for the Spring Festival holiday. Although no stress is revealed from the tweet itself, from the follow-up interactive comments made by the user and her friends, we can find that the user is actually stressed from work. Thus, simply relying on a user's tweeting content for stress detection is insufficient.",

                "text": "Users' Social Interactions on Social Networks Contain Useful Cues for Stress Detection. Social psychological studies have made two interesting observations. The first is mood contagion [37] : a bad mood can be transferred from one person to another during social interaction. The second is linguistic echoes [34] : people are known to mimic the style and affect of another person. These observations motivate us to expand the scope of tweet-wise investigation by incorporating follow-up social interactions like comments and retweeting activities in user's stress detection. This may actually help to mitigate the single user's data sparsity problem. Another reason for considering social interactions in stress detection is based on our empirical findings on a large-scale dataset crawled from Sina Weibo that the social structures of stressed users are less connected and thus less complicated than those of non-stressed users. This is consistent with the Pew Research Center's finding that stressed users are less active than non-stressed ones. The bottom of Fig. 2 illustrates four social interaction structure patterns. Each node in a structure pattern represents a user's interacting friend (who either commented or retweeted the tweets). If two nodes are also friends on social network, there is an edge linking both; otherwise, there is none. We examined 3,000 users on Sina Weibo. For each user, we collected and merged his/her one week tweets into one and sense stress from it. Meanwhile, we captured the top-3 most active friends the user interacted with.",

The user-level attributes however are composed of: (a) posting behavior attributes as summarized from a user's weekly tweet postings; and (b) social interaction attributes extracted from a user's social interactions with friends.

Our investigation unveils some intriguing social phenomena. For example, we find that the number of social structures of sparse connection (i.e., with no delta connections 4 ) of stressed users is around 14 percent higher than that of non-stressed users, indicating that the social structure of stressed users' friends tend to be less connected and complicated, compared to that of non-stressed users.",

                "text": "Research on Tweet-Level Emotion Detection in Social Networks. Computer-aided detection, analysis, and application of emotion, especially in social networks, have drawn much attention in recent years [8] , [9] , [28] , [41] , [52] , [53] . Relationships between psychological stress and personality traits can be an interesting issue to consider [11] , [16] , [43] . For example, [1] providing evidence that daily stress can be reliably recognized based on behavioral metrics from users mobile phone activity. Many studies on social media based emotion analysis are at the tweet level, using text-based linguistic features and classic classification approaches. Zhao et al. [53] proposed a system called MoodLens to perform emotion analysis on the Chinese micro-blog platform Weibo, classifying the emotion categories into four types, i.e., angry, disgusting, joyful, and sad. Fan et al. [9] studied the emotion propagation problem in social networks, and found that anger has a stronger correlation among different users than joy, indicating that negative emotions could spread more quickly and broadly in the network. As stress is mostly considered as a negative emotion, this conclusion can help us in combining the social influence of users for stress detection. However, these work mainly leverage the textual contents in social networks. In reality, data in social networks is usually composed of sequential and inter-connected items from diverse sources and modalities, making it be actually cross-media data.",

While tweet-level emotion detection reflects the instant emotion expressed in a single tweet, people's emotion or psychological stress states are usually more enduring, changing over different time periods. In recent years, extensive research starts to focus on user-level emotion detection in social networks [29] , [36] , [38] , [50] . Our recent work [29] proposed to detect users psychological stress states from social media by learning user-level presentation via a deep convolution network on sequential tweet series in a certain time period. Motivated by the principle of homophily, [38] incorporated social relationships to improve user-level sentiment analysis in Twitter. Though some user-level emotion detection studies have been done, the role that social relationships plays in one's psychological stress states, and how we can incorporate such information into stress detection have not been examined yet.",

Specifically, we first adopt LTP [4] -A Chinese Language Technology Platform-to perform lexical analysis, e.g., tokenize and lemmatize, and then explore the use of a Chinese LIWC dictionary-LIWC2007 [14] , to map the words into positive/negative emotions. LIWC2007 is a dictionary which categorizes words based on their linguistic or psychological meanings, so we can classify words into different categories, e.g., positive/negative emotion words, degree adverbs. We have also tested other linguistic resources including NRC 5 and HowNet, 6 and found that the performances were relatively the same, so we adopted the commonly used LIWC2007 dictionary for experiments. Furthermore, we extract linguistic attributes of emoticons (e.g., and ) and punctuation marks ('!', '?', '...', '.'). Weibo defines every emoticon in square brackets (e.g., they use [haha] for \"laugh\"), so we can map the keyword in square brackets to find the emoticons. Twitter adopts Unicode as the representation for all emojis [15] , [24] , which can be extracted directly. The list of linguistic attributes and descriptions are shown in Table 1 .",

We use one week as the sampling period in this paper. On one hand, psychological stress often results from cumulative events or mental states. On the other hand, users may express their chronic stress in a series of tweets rather than one. Besides, the aforementioned social interaction patterns of users in a period of time also contain useful information for stress detection. Moreover, as aforementioned, the information in tweets is limited and sparse, we need to integrate more complementary information around tweets, e.g., users' social interactions with friends. Thus, appropriately designed user-level attributes can provide a macro-scope of a user's stress states, and avoid noise or missing data. Here, we define user-level attributes from two aspects to measure the differences between stressed and nonstressed states based on users' weekly tweet postings: 1) userlevel posting behavior attributes [29] from the user's weekly tweet postings; and 2) user-level social interaction attributes from the user's social interactions beneath his/her weekly tweet postings.

We address the solution through the following two key components: First, we design a CNN with cross autoencoders (CAE) to generate user-level interaction content attributes from tweet-level attributes. The CNN has been found to be effective in learning stationary local attributes for series like images [3] , [6] and audios [30] , [48] . Then, we design a partially-labeled factor graph (PFG) to incorporate all three aspects of user-level attributes for user stress detection. Factor graph model has been widely used in social network modeling [10] , [39] , [44] . It is effective in leveraging social correlations for different prediction tasks.

[18] While training the cross auto-encoder, we use training data that contains all the three modalities. We manually disable the visual modalities and/or social interaction 8 modality of the training data, and require it to reconstruct all three modalities.

When max pooling is used, the pooled attribute unit is assigned with the maximal activation among all units in the attribute map. When meanpooling is applied, the mean of activations of all units in the attribute map is assigned to the pooled attribute unit. Since we pool over the period of time rather than a certain number of tweets, we use (MOT) in this paper, which can be calculated by summing up the activations, since the tweet instances are sampled in the same length of time intervals.",

To solve this problem, we employed a sentence pattern labeling method to automatically extract labeled data from the crawled largescale social media data. We first crawled 350 million tweets data via Sina Weibo's REST APIs 9 from Oct. 2009 to Oct. 2012. Sina weibo, as the biggest microblog website in China, provides users an open online platform for information sharing, communication and obtaining. Similar to Twitter and Facebook, users on Sina Weibo can post contents with multiple modalities, including text, image, social action (retweet, comment, favorite), video and etc. Despite these user generated contents, user relationship, which takes the form of following on Sina Weibo, also contains abundant information for data analysis. Utilizing above information and features extracted from multiple modalities, we are able to investigate users emotions, stresses and opinions.",

The weeks containing such sentence patterns are labeled as \"stressed\" weeks. Similarly, we identify \"non-stressed\" weeks of users by searching for tweets with patterns like \"I feel relaxed\" and \"I feel nonstressed\".

These results demonstrate the feasibility of stress detection via the brand new information source of social interactions, and that our proposed model can significantly enhance the performance by leveraging the social interaction information.

The results are shown in Table 6 . It is interesting to note that using only text attribute could achieve rather high performance. Simply combining visual or social attributes with text attributes may even reduce the performance, especially the social attributes. This trend is even more obvious when both types of attributes (content and posting behavior) are used. Nevertheless, using all attributes together outperforms that using only the text attributes; and the highest performance is observed when using all attribute and working with both types of attributes.",

We still use the attribute extractor trained with large scale Sina Weibo dataset and only finetune the network with Twitter dataset in 5-fold. The accuracy is 77.43 percent and F1score is 0.8224. One reason for this modest result is that users in Twitter dataset and Sina Weibo dataset come from different language and culture background, so that the language patterns and sentimental signals from these two different language environments can be different, thus the attribute extractor trained with large scale Sina Weibo dataset may not be fully functional for Twitter datasets. Nevertheless, we still achieved acceptable performance in Twitter dataset, which implies that the basic stress patterns between social relations can be transferred in between different language environments. Another factor could be that the scale of this dataset is rather small. Subjects in the Twitter dataset are on the order of 10 percent than that in large-scale Sina Weibo dataset. We look into the collected data and find that, by coincidence, all tweets in this dataset have no social activity. We conjecture this is also one of the causes of the unsatisfactory result.",

For this in-depth study, we select top four users with the most frequent interactions from users' weekly tweet postings, where four is adopted because this is the minimum number of nodes required to produce structural combinations (10 combinations), so as to calculate the probability of each combination, and incorporating more nodes would make the calculation combinatorial expensive. We measure the connection of the interacting users by the following link, that is, if A is following or followed by B, then A and B are connected, and cliques made up of different nodes are treated the same. We compare the proportion of different social structures of interacting users to measure the structural diversity.

As for the stress state labeling, all users including friends are labeled using the sentence pattern method described in previous section. Fig. 8a shows the probability that a user being stressed, conditioned on the number of stressed neighbors that the user has in the social network. We can see that being stressed is a mutually correlated behavior. In particular, the chance that a none-stressed user becoming stressed increases to three times higher for those with stressed neighbors than for those without. Another trend observed from Fig. 8a is that the likelihood of a user becoming stressed increases with the number of stressed neighbors.",

In our work, we tried different values for the threshold and finally chose three by cross-validation. If two users interact with each other more than three times, we call the relationship a strong tie, and otherwise a weak tie. This definition of user ties is adopted as the standard treatment in the research of social network analysis [17] , so as to capture the most recent user relationships in a shifting environment. Fig. 8b illustrates the results. We can see that strong ties indeed have strong influence on users' stress states, and the influence of weak ties is relatively weak. For example, when a user has three stressed strong-tie connections, the probability that the user will become stressed increases to 13 percent, more than twice as high as for a user with three stressed weak-tie connections.",

Tweet-level attributes of the user are processed through a convolution with CAE to form the user-level content attributes. The user-level attributes are denoted by x t i in the left box. Every x t i contains three aspects: user-level content attributes, user-level posting behavior attributes, and user-level social interaction attributes. Data of other users follows the same route. In the FGM, attribute factors connect user-level attributes to corresponding stress states. Social factors connect the stress state of different users. Dynamic factors connect stress state of a user over time. The output of the user's user-level stress state at time t is y t 1 as highlighted in red, which actually denotes the stress state of the user in weekly period in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Background: Stress is a contributing factor to many major health problems in the United States, such as heart disease, depression, and autoimmune diseases. Relaxation is often recommended in mental health treatment as a frontline strategy to reduce stress, thereby improving health conditions. Twitter is a microblog platform that allows users to post their own personal messages (tweets), including their expressions about feelings and actions related to stress and stress management (eg, relaxing). While Twitter is increasingly used as a source of data for understanding mental health from a population perspective, the specific issue of stress-as manifested on Twitter-has not yet been the focus of any systematic study.\nThe objective of our study was to understand how people express their feelings of stress and relaxation through Twitter messages. In addition, we aimed at investigating automated natural language processing methods to (1) classify stress versus nonstress and relaxation versus nonrelaxation tweets, and (2) identify first-hand experience-that is, who is the experiencer-in stress and relaxation tweets.\nWe first performed a qualitative content analysis of 1326 and 781 tweets containing the keywords \"stress\" and \"relax,\" respectively. We then investigated the use of machine learning algorithms-in particular naive Bayes and support vector machines-to automatically classify tweets as stress versus nonstress and relaxation versus nonrelaxation. Finally, we applied these classifiers to sample datasets drawn from 4 cities in the United States (Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco) obtained from Twitter's streaming application programming interface, with the goal of evaluating the extent of any correlation between our automatic classification of tweets and results from public stress surveys.\nResults: Content analysis showed that the most frequent topic of stress tweets was education, followed by work and social relationships. The most frequent topic of relaxation tweets was rest & vacation, followed by nature and water. When we applied the classifiers to the cities dataset, the proportion of stress tweets in New York and San Diego was substantially higher than that in Los Angeles and San Francisco. In addition, we found that characteristic expressions of stress and relaxation varied for each city based on its geolocation.\nThis content analysis and infodemiology study revealed that Twitter, when used in conjunction with natural language processing techniques, is a useful data source for understanding stress and stress management strategies, and can potentially supplement infrequently collected survey-based stress data.",

Underscoring the magnitude of the problem, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that 49% of the American public reported being stressed within the last year, and also found that 60% of those who reported being in poor health also reported experiencing a substantial amount of stress within the last month [7] . Further, levels of stress appear to be unequally distributed throughout the population [10] . National surveys have documented that higher levels of stress are reported among those who have lower income, are less educated, and are younger [11] . Theorists have suggested that geographic clustering of psychological characteristics may be driven by selective migration (in this case, people more vulnerable to stress seek out others like themselves), social influence (ie, people with attitudes and beliefs that lead to greater stress cluster together geographically), or environmental influence (ie, features of the physical environment, such as neighborhoods, increase stress among those who live close to one another) [12] . In short, large-scale studies have documented both the high prevalence of stress within the United States and geographic clustering of psychological distress, suggesting that symptoms of stress should ideally be tracked at both the national and local levels.",

General stress management can include adaptive coping (eg, distraction), physical relaxation strategies (eg, diaphragmatic breathing), cognitive reappraisal (eg, reconsidering the stressor from a different perspective), and mindfulness (ie, increasing awareness of the present moment). These stress management strategies are intended to reduce psychological and physiological arousal related to stress, promote healthier coping alternatives, and, in turn, reduce some of the negative health impacts of stress. Indeed, these strategies have been found to be effective for improving health outcomes among those living with chronic illness [14] [15] [16] , as well as for improving general mental health and quality of life [17, 18] .",

Population health surveys often use telephone interviews or questionnaires from samples of the population, such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [20] . These methods, although reliable, are conducted relatively infrequently due to cost and may be less effective at reaching certain populations, such as those without a dedicated landline telephone. With the rapid growth of online social networks today, social media data can serve as a useful additional resource to understand aspects of stress that are difficult to assess in general surveys or clinical care. For example, social media provide a means to rapidly and dynamically address new and evolving research questions with a degree of flexibility not possible with surveys. Social media may also provide insights into populations that may be underrepresented in surveys (depending on the demographics of the particular social media platform used). Thus, social media can potentially serve as a beneficial supplement to detailed surveys when trying to understand public health concerns.",

We first generated unigrams and bigrams from dataset 1, and one author (AR) manually reviewed and selected the highest-frequency unigram and bigram keywords. We then manually added corresponding synonyms into each theme to increase the coverage of the classifier. For example, the topic \"education\" in the stress schema contained the unigrams \"school,\" \"college,\" and \"classes\" and the bigram \"high school\" in dataset 1. We manually added synonyms of those terms, such as \"exams\" and \"studying\" as unigram keywords and \"college life,\" \"my tuition,\" and \"on finals\" into bigram keywords. The list was iteratively reviewed and confirmed by another author (SD). There was an average of 20 unigram and 20 bigram terms for each theme. We created only unigram and bigram keywords, since tweet messages are short in nature. Bigram keywords were necessary to include idiomatic expressions like \"vicious cycle\" and \"hate feeling,\" and they also added more specificity, such as \"my heart\" and \"my sanity,\" which helped to increase the accuracy of the classifiers.

To apply the classifier trained on dataset 1 to the unseen, much larger dataset 2 (cities dataset), we first filtered tweets by keeping only the tweets that contained stress-or relaxation-related hashtags in Textbox 1 or the keywords \"stress\" or \"relax\" for each city in dataset 2. After this step, dataset 2 contained only tweets with stress-or relaxation-related keywords or hashtags. To calculate the proportion of stress or relaxation tweets at the city level, we used the stress or relaxation classifier trained on dataset 1 to filter stress or relaxation tweets, and then applied the classifier for first-hand experiencer to tweets from each city in dataset 2. Figure 4 shows a flowchart describing our machine learning design. Our study focused on 2 machine learning-based classification tasks. First, tweets were classified into the appropriate stress and relaxation category (ie, is it stress or relaxation related?). Second, first-hand experience tweets versus nonfirst-hand experience tweets were classified. We used 2 machine learning algorithms: naive Bayes and support vector machines (SVMs), which were implemented on dataset 1 using 10-fold cross-validation. We used both the naive Bayes and SVM algorithms, as both these algorithms have been used extensively for text classification tasks [50] [51] [52] . We used the Rainbow package [51] for implementing both naive Bayes and SVMs (linear kernel). We used \"bag-of-words\" as feature sets for both algorithms. The reason we used the bag-of-word representation is that this feature representation is considered as a baseline and the most common text representation in text classification in general [50] [51] [52] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on classifying tweets on stress and relaxation tweets. ",

This suggests that people may react to stress positively, or that people are more likely to publicly report positive rather than negative actions. Examples of positive reaction in stress tweets are rest (\"Rest is best when you are stressed\") and exercising (\"I'm so stressed, thank god I'm heading to yoga now\").",

The most frequent topic of stress tweets in our datasets was education, which likely reflects the younger demographic of Twitter users [57, 58] , but work and travel were also common topics. It is notable that, despite poverty rates, unemployment rates, and cost of living being significant factors in the methodology of CNN's and Forbes's stress ranking systems of the most stressful cities, finances were not a major content topic of the stress tweets in any city in our studies. Although this result could be partially attributable to the need for either computer or mobile phone access in order to use Twitter and may cause underrepresentation in lower-income groups, it may also indicate that certain topics, such as personal finances, still remain relatively taboo in social media settings. Regarding positive and negative actions regarding stress, positive actions far outnumbered more destructive behavior. The use of Twitter in itself to discuss feelings of stress and stress management can be seen as a constructive manner of dealing with stress by expressing these feelings and using the support of \"followers\" and friends. Social media platforms are increasingly being used as support networks in the management of chronic health conditions as varied as cancer, depression, and obesity. A recent systematic review by Patel et al found that the impact of social media use on those experiencing chronic disease was positive in 48% of studies reviewed, neutral in 45%, and harmful in only 7% [60] .",

A further key theme that emerged from a qualitative analysis of the data was the idea of nature-in this case, particularly water (eg, \"pool,\" \"beach,\" \"rain\")-as being of key importance for relaxation.

Furthermore, using additional feature sets, such as ngrams, emotions, and negations, could help improve accuracy.

The experiment consists of two parts, designed to replicate the production and consumption of textual content in online social media. The goal of the content production part (Tasks 1-4) is, for a given input tweet, to output shortened versions while preserving the meaning of the input tweet. In the content consumption part of the experiment (Task 5), we show participants pairs of tweets (a short tweet [treatment] and the corresponding long original tweet [control] ) and ask which one is more likely to see more retweets. The output of this setup is binary votes (several per pair), based on which we compute the probability of success for each tweet version.",

Short messages are wellsuited to small screens, and images with few words in large text are often shared widely. Many social media platforms even enforce hard length constraints, epitomized by Twitter's signature character limit. Online messages are thus shaped by length constraints, with far-reaching consequences: as McLuhan [37] famously pointed out, \"The medium is the message,\" and the constraints that a medium imposes affect the audience not only through the content delivered over the medium, but also through the characteristics of the medium itself. Therefore, as social media continue to play an increasingly critical role in modern societies, influencing what we read, what we buy, and whom we elect into office, understanding how constraints, especially brevity constraints, affect the effectiveness of social media messages has major societal as well as financial ramifications.",

Expressing one's thoughts in few words may be more difficult than doing so in many (as Blaise Pascal quips in the opening quote)-is brevity worth the effort? or voting randomly in the rating task.

For example, researchers can link the success of posts (e.g., the number of shares or likes) to linguistic features including length and wording. It is tempting to study the benefits of brevity online in a straightforward fashion and correlate the length of social media posts with their success, as done by countless social media \"pundits\", who observe, e.g., that \"tweets containing less than 100 characters receive, on average, 17 percent higher engagement than longer tweets\" [49] and conclude that users, therefore, should use fewer than 100 characters in their tweets. Unfortunately, this na\u00efve approach is fraught with confounding factors: The length of a tweet may be correlated with its topic, and some topics may be inherently more shared, but due to their inherent attractiveness, not due to the length or brevity of the tweets users write about them. Also, users who write better content in general might also write more concisely; so what causes more engagement in these users' tweets might be the overall quality of content, rather than the fact that the content is also concise. Finally, posts written at certain times (e.g., during hectic lunch hours) might be both more concise as well as more interesting than posts written at other times (e.g., lengthy posts written out of boredom during a sleepless night).",

Some observational studies have striven to approximate this ideal goal by carefully controlling for confounding factors. Tan et al. [53] consider pairs of tweets that were posted by the same user and contain the same URL, but are differently worded otherwise, thus avoiding user-and certain topic-related confounds. Analyzing such pairs, they establish correlations between the wording and success (in terms of retweets) of messages, finding that the longer tweet within a pair is on average more successful, and concluding that being long and informative beats being concise.",

Hence, comparing tweets of exactly or just under 140 characters before vs. after the switch (while avoiding user-and certain topic-related confounds by comparing only tweets written by the same user or containing the same hashtags), allowed us to approximate the effects of length constraints on the style and success of content.

The question how to word a message in order to convey it most successfully is important across a number of contexts, e.g., in political campaigns, marketing slogans, or writing convincing manuscripts. In the context of online communities, too, understanding what wording makes messages successful is of growing importance. The question is often formulated as the task of predicting what makes textual content become popular [7, 22, 31] . In the specific case of Twitter, in addition to characterizing how language is used on the platform in general [18, 24, 33, 41] , researchers have investigated the correlation of linguistic signals with the propagation of tweets [2, 4, 46, 53] .

In particular, length constraints are often thought to have a positive impact on the quality of content. For instance, the conciseness of research paper titles correlates with how frequently a research paper is cited [9] . Research on the effect of constraints on creativity reveals the presence of two opposite effectsrestricting freedom directs the search for solutions and degrades creativity, but simultaneously, having too much freedom can be paralyzing and detrimental. The trade-off with the best compromise between the two extremes occurs at a sweet spot with just the right amount of constraints [44] . (For a more complete account, we refer the reader to Onarheim and Biskjaer's survey on creativity constraints [43] .) This interplay is a central open question in creativity research, and it remains unclear how these complex phenomena reflect on the universe of online social media.",

For each shortened version, we assigned a worker who answered the three comprehension questions based on the shortened tweet. Workers performing Tasks 2 and 3 could not participate, as they had already been exposed to the original tweets and had thus potentially more information than contained in the shortened version. We evaluated the accuracy when answering questions, revealing that it is possible to reduce the length while maintaining the critical information down to 20% of the original length (Fig. 2a ). We require that all three comprehension questions were correctly answered (except for the largest level of shortening, i.e., 10-20% of the original length). If they were not, the tweet was discarded and the shortening was performed again, by another worker, to ensure that we gather all validated shortened versions for all tweets. Note that, from here on, in the experiment and in the analysis we only consider validated shortened tweets where all questions were answered correctly, except for the largest level of shortening (10-20% of the original length), where it becomes essentially impossible to maintain the meaning.

Part of the content production phase is to ensure that shortened versions contain the essential content of the unshortened version.

This raises the potential concern that the observed effect of length constraints on the probability of success might simply be explained by spending more time on certain target lengths than on others. To investigate this, we measure how long workers took to shorten tweets for each length constraint. Workers spent on median 48 seconds on the shortening task across all target lengths. Broken down for different target lengths, the median editing time varies from 39 to 55.5 seconds. In the optimal range of shortening (10-20%), workers spent 53.5 seconds on median, slightly less than in the less successful ranges of 20-30% and 30-40% (55.5 seconds on median). Given the significant differences in the probability of success between different target lengths and similar times per task, the differences in time spent alone are unlikely to explain the observed differences in probability of success. i.e., for each level of shortening, the fraction of input tweets for which that level saw the largest probability of success (with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals). The optimal range corresponds to shortening by 10-20% of the original length. In summary, both a length-and a tweet-centric analysis reveals significant benefits of shortening compared to the baseline, with the optimal amount of shortening being 10-20% of the original length.",

We compare the trend for each feature against the same baseline-function words-as function words do not carry meaning of their own. We report significance levels according to Chow's test (cf. Sec. 4) using the adjusted significance level of \u03b1 = 0.0085, due to multiple hypothesis testing for the six psychological processes. We note that in the process of editing a tweet to make it more concise, words describing affects (e.g., nice, love, nasty) are preserved more than function words (p < 10 -7 ). On the other hand, words describing cognitive processes (such as know, think, maybe) and relativity (end, until, down, in) are preserved less (no significant differences compared to the baseline). Perceptual words (look, feel, hear) have a better chance of being preserved compared to the function-word baseline (p < 10 -4 ). Finally, words that carry affect (Fig. 10a ) or describe subjective perceptions (Fig. 10d ) are preserved disproportionately more than cognitive words that indicate reasoning (Fig. 10c ).",

The experiment consists of two parts, designed to replicate the production and consumption of textual content in online social media. The goal of the content production part (Tasks 1-4) is, for a given input tweet, to output shortened versions while preserving the meaning of the input tweet. In the content consumption part of the experiment (Task 5), we show participants pairs of tweets (a short tweet [treatment] and the corresponding long original tweet[control]) and ask which one is more likely to see more retweets. The output of this setup is binary votes (several per pair), based on which we compute the probability of success for each tweet version.",

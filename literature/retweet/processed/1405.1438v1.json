While there has been extensive prior work looking into predicting popularity of socialmedia content, the effect of wording per se has rarely been studied since it is often confounded with the popularity of the author and the topic. To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics. Still, humans can answer this question better than chance (but far from perfectly), and the computational methods we develop can do better than both an average human and a strong competing method trained on noncontrolled data.",

In contrast to the identity/social/timing/topic features mentioned above, wording is one of the few factors directly under an author's control when he or she seeks to convey a fixed piece of content. For example, consider a speaker at the ACL business meeting who has been tasked with proposing that Paris be the next ACL location. This person cannot on the spot become ACL president, change the shape of his/her social network, wait until the next morning to speak, or campaign for Rome instead; but he/she can craft the message to be more humorous, more informative, emphasize certain aspects instead of others, and so on. In other words, we investigate whether a different choice of words affects message propagation, controlling for user and topic: would user BarackObama have gotten significantly more (or fewer) retweets if he had used some alternate wording to announce his reelection?",

Specifically, it turns out to be unexpectedly common for the same user to post different tweets regarding the same URLa good proxy for fine-grained topic 2 -within a relatively short period of time. 3 Some example pairs are shown in Table 1 ; we see that the paired tweets may differ dramatically, going far beyond word-for-word substitutions, so that quite interesting changes can be studied.",

Simmons et al. (2011) examined the variation of quotes from different sources to examine how textual memes mutate as people pass them along, but did not control for author. Predicting the \"success\" of various texts such as novels and movie quotes has been the aim of additional prior work not already mentioned in \u00a71 (Ashok et al., 2013; Louis and Nenkova, 2013; Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008; McIntyre and Lapata, 2009) . To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale studies exploring wording effects in a both topic-and author-controlled setting. Employing such controls, we find that predicting the more effective alternative wording is much harder than the previously well-studied problem of pre-dicting popular content when author or topic can freely vary.",

This crawling process also yielded 632K TAC pairs whose only difference was spacing, and an additional 558M \"unpaired\" tweets; as shown later in this paper, we used these extra corpora for computing language models and other auxiliary information. We applied nonobvious but important filtering -described later in this section -to control for other external factors and to reduce ambiguous cases. This brought us to a set of 11,404 pairs, with the gold-standard labels determined by which tweet in each pair was the one that received more retweets according to the Twitter API. We then did a second crawl to get an additional 1,770 pairs to serve as a held-out dataset.

The basic sanity check we performed here was to take as features the number of occurrences of the verbs 'rt', 'retweet', 'please', 'spread', 'pls', and 'plz' to capture explicit requests (e.g. \"please retweet\").",

We also consider tagged bag-ofwords (\"BOW\") features, which includes all the unigram (word:POS pair) and bigram features that appear more than 10 times in the cross-validation data. This yields 3,568 unigram features and 4,095 bigram features, for a total of 7,663 so-called 1,2-gram features. Values for each feature are normalized by linear transformation across all tweets in the training data to lie in the range r0, 1s.18 For a given TAC pair, we construct its feature vector as follows. For each feature being considered, we compute its normalized value for each tweet in the pair and take the difference as the feature value for this pair. We use L2-regularized logistic regression as our classifier, with parameters chosen by cross validation on the training data.

To test this, we consider an alternative binary L2-regularized logistic-regression classifier that is trained on unpaired data, specifically, on the collection of 10,000 most retweeted tweets (gold-standard label: positive) plus the 10,000 least retweeted tweets (gold-standard label: negative) that are neither retweets nor replies. Note that this alternative thus is granted, by design, roughly twice the training instances that our classifiers have, as a result of having roughly the same number of tweets, since our instances are pairs. Moreover, we additionally include the tweet author's follower count, and the day and hour of posting, as features. We refer to this alternative classifier as TAC+ff+time.

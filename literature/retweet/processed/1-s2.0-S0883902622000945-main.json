Using venture capital funding as a status proxy, we analyzed 369,142 Twitter posts by 268 new ventures. We found that status (1) increases engagement with ventures' tweets, and that it (2) moderates the effect of provocative language on audience engagement so that provocative language has a negative effect for low-status ventures but a positive effect for high-status ventures. Post-hoc analyses provide a basis for pragmatic theorizing and explore the effects of status tiers and subdimensions of provocative language.",

The advent of social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook means that we may need to reconsider how new ventures can effectively communicate with external audiences (Etter et al., 2019) . It is well established that new ventures benefit from social media communication (e.g., Antretter et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2017) and that effective social media communication needs to engage social media audiences, commonly measured via shares and likes (e.g., Gelper et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2018; Mallipeddi et al., 2021) . However, we are just beginning to understand what drives such engagement in an entrepreneurship context (cf. Roccapriore and Pollock, 2022) .",

For example, to gain market awareness and acceptance, ventures communicate to broader audiences through journalists and editors (for a literature review on firm media coverage, see Graf-Vlachy et al., 2019) , telling attractive stories about the new venture and the entrepreneurial team (Martens et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2020; Shoemaker and Vos, 2009) .",

Instead, ventures broadcast posts to diverse audiences in a context of fragmented and fleeting communication (Fischer and Reuber, 2014) and rely on these audiences to rebroadcast their posts to wider audiences. It is thus well established that effective social media communication involves high audience engagement, commonly represented by audience members endorsing and sharing these social media posts (e.g., Gelper et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2018; Mallipeddi et al., 2021) .",

This approach is perhaps best exemplified by Elon Finally, new ventures seek financial resources from venture capitalists and others to grow and exploit potential opportunities (Clough et al., 2019) . Over and above the financial capital provided, ventures backed by VC benefit from enhanced status when competing for prospective talent (Hellmann and Puri, 2002; Vanacker et al., 2013) , alliance partners (Pollock and Gulati, 2007) , or public market investors (Lee et al., 2011) . We add to the nuance of VC funding effects on new ventures by highlighting that VC funding is a valuable status marker that can be imported to online settings. Therefore, we add knowledge about the consequences of VC funding beyond its immediate financial benefits by providing a basis for linking the off-and online contexts (Wang et al., 2021) .",

Second, on Twitter ventures can communicate with a range of stakeholders, including potential and existing investors (Blankespoor et al., 2014; Prokofieva, 2015) . Twitter is even recognized by the US Securities and Exchange Commission as a means of public disclosure (SEC, 2013) . Finally, tweets-as minimally customizable narratives (Czarniawska and Wolff, 1998) 3 -are increasingly forming the data backbone of a growing scholarly conversation in the entrepreneurship literature that qualitatively and quantitatively examines social media and online communication by entrepreneurs (Fisch and Block, 2021; Fischer and Reuber, 2014; Obschonka et al., 2017) .",

Thus, status is central to understanding the drivers of social media behavior (Levina and Arriaga, 2014) . Status represents the extent to which others respect or honor a social actor (for a review on the nature of status, see Magee and Galinsky, 2008) .

Similarly, retweeting is seen as \"both a contribution to the platform (a tweet) and an act of evaluation (signaling that somebody else's contribution is worthy of attention)\" (Levina and Arriaga, 2014, p. 478) . The motivation behind retweeting was further nuanced by Metaxas et al. (2015, p. 661) , who surveyed Twitter users and conducted a meta-review of 100 Twitter-related publications. They found that \"retweeting indicates not only interest in a message, but also trust in the message and the originator, and agreement with the message contents.\" Thus, Twitter functions such that users generally share content they find relevant and interesting, believing that others will or should find it relevant and interesting, too (Twitter, 2022b) . 4 While engagement with posts contributes to the formation of online status hierarchies through collective evaluation of what (and who) deserves attention, online communities also import status markers from offline settings (Bianchi et al., 2012) . Prior status literature in management has demonstrated similar transferability of status between domains. For example, research has shown that venture capitalists with high status in home markets can benefit from it in foreign markets (Liu and Maula, 2021) and that commercial banks can leverage their status when entering new market domains (Jensen, 2003) . Referring to social media, Twitter has been highlighted as a context in which such external status transfers can be particularly effective (Levina and Arriaga, 2014) .",

However, such reactions do not change the collective judgments (Etter et al., 2019) , and even when retweeting signals disagreement, the original tweet is still engaging the audience. This audience engagement likely means that the content is worthy of attention, as the audience feels compelled to respond.",

Consecration, conceptually and empirically (Allen and Parsons, 2006; Jones and Massa, 2013) , refers to events where authoritative actors-who determine selections, honors, and prizes-elevate another actor's status by selecting it from the many (Allen and Lincoln, 2004) .",

While different types of affiliations (e.g., alliance partners, universities, or incubators) can influence a venture's status, relationships that include financial commitments have a more substantial signaling effect than non-equity ones (Hsu, 2004; Stuart et al., 1999) . Given venture capitalists' highly selective nature and strong due-diligence processes, VC funding provides an important endorsement of a venture's quality (Blevins and Ragozzino, 2018) , separating consecrated ventures from the rest. Acquiring VC is far from the norm, as only 0.05 % of ventures receive VC funding (Wood, 2020) . VC funding brings the endorsed actors into the spotlight (Pollock and Gulati, 2007) .

Following this logic of social influence, VC-funded ventures are arguably more visible (Pollock and Gulati, 2007) , which directs audiences' attention to them. Indeed, although such consecration is earned outside the social media setting, it still forms an important part of these ventures' broader symbolic capital (Bourdieu, 2018) and, as such, can play an important role in guiding social recognition in online settings, particularly on Twitter (Levina and Arriaga, 2014) . Although users are exposed to posts from all the people and organizations they follow, they are more likely to pay attention to posts by actors of higher status (e.g., Aral, 2013; Rao et al., 2003) , which should increase their tendency to engage with a post.",

Such ingratiation carries the prospect of elevating one's own status within the online community. Social media platforms are places where users are driven by impression-management motives (Wilson and Proudfoot, 2014) and seek to promote themselves (Moon et al., 2016; Taylor and Strutton, 2016) . Because audience members' likes and shares are public statements that confer association between users (Metaxas et al., 2015; Parmelee and Bichard, 2013) , they can represent \"prisms\" through which users are evaluated by others (Podolny, 2001) . Thus, users' responses not only contribute to the status of the post's originator but also make possible a spillover effect of this status for those who like and share. If high-status communicators' messages are seen as more important (Rhee and Fiss, 2014) , by engaging with posts of high-status actors, online audiences seek to signal that they are part of a more prominent conversation. Considering these together, we thus hypothesize as follows5 : Hypothesis 1. Tweets by new ventures of higher status (i.e., ventures with VC funding) will have higher audience engagement than those from ventures of lower status (i.e., ventures without VC funding).",

Such statements exemplify that entrepreneurs of varying statuses share perceptions of intense competition for attention on social media platforms (Gelper et al., 2021; Iyer and Katona, 2016) , which puts pressure on their posts to stand out. The pressure is due to the vast content shared on social media, only a fraction of which attracts substantial audience engagement (e.g., Berger and Milkman, 2012; Weng et al., 2012) .",

More specifically, we build on the linguistic framing literature that suggests that entrepreneurs and firms carefully choose their words to frame their communication (e.g., Rhee and Fiss, 2014; Snihur et al., 2021) in order to shape audience perceptions (Emrich et al., 2001) and reactions (Cornelissen and Werner, 2014; Entman, 1993; Pan et al., 2020) . These linguistic frames are defined by particular vocabularies (Ruebottom, 2013) . Entrepreneurs and firms use such framing to stir controversy (Delacour and Leca, 2017; Meyer and H\u00f6llerer, 2010) in order to attract media attention (Andrews and Caren, 2010) and generate audience engagement on social media (Roccapriore and Pollock, 2022; Small and Warn, 2020) .",

                "text": "The notion that ventures could increase audience engagement on social media through provocative language in their tweets is supported by two arguments. First, as discussed previously, the vast information on social media exceeds human cognitive processing capacity, making audiences resort to heuristics in deciding which content to pay attention to and engage with (Gelper et al., 2021; Morris et al., 2012) . Such heuristics are useful when people confront information overflow-as is the case with information on social media; information must stand out to be noticed, interpreted, and evaluated (Kahneman et al., 1982) . Provocative language likely helps new ventures stand out on social media because such language challenges and transgresses many people's \"values, norms or taboos that are habitually not challenged or transgressed\" (V\u00e9zina and Paul, 1997, p. 179) . For example, one of the posts in our sample states, \"Do you fight dirty? Yeah, fuck, yeah. Why Crossfit is so litigious.\" This framing is evidently more provocative and attentiongrabbing than non-provocative reframing, such as \"Let us explain the reasons behind Crossfit's litigation.\" 6Second, provocative language evokes emotions, and emotional content can drive audience engagement on social media (Berger and Milkman, 2012; Heimbach and Hinz, 2016; Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017 ) regardless of whether it generates a positive emotional reaction, like appreciation (B\u00e9al and Gr\u00e9goire, 2021) , or a negative emotional reaction, like anger (Hasell and Weeks, 2016) . Indeed, audiences are engaged by provocative communication in controversial advertising (Petrescu and Korgaonkar, 2011; Porter and Golan, 2006; Sabri, 2017) and politicians' attacks on opponents (Boulianne and Larsson, 2021; Fine and Hunt, 2021; Meeks, 2020) .",

On social media, when a user engages with a high-status venture's provocative post, the user joins a potentially inflammatory and wider-reaching conversation amplified by the high-status communicator's visibility, as public attention feeds itself (Trumbo, 1995) . Engaging with (1) a provocative tweet from (2) a high-status actor, therefore, may synergistically increase an audience member's own visibility, given that by liking or sharing such a post, the audience member could also attract heightened engagement. The prospect of visibility is important because \"reaching and being listened to by other peers in the network\" has been described as a primary driver of social media use (Iyer and Katona, 2016, p. 2) . By contrast, engaging with a provocative post from a low-status venture is unlikely to contribute to the audience member's desired visibility to the same extent. It misses the potential to gain such momentum due to the lack of visibility by a low-status venture.",

                "text": "Second, beyond visibility, venture status has a bearing on the credibility of the provocative tone. Indeed, \"the persuasive power of speakers rests not only on what they say and how well they say it but also on who they are. In other words, the status and prestige of the communicators have a direct bearing on the perceived plausibility of claims\" (Benford, 1993, p. 693 ). In the context of provocative frames, this plausibility can be especially tenuous coming from a low-status actor and seen as \"colorful and dramatic\u2026but\u2026 'talking loudly and carrying a small stick' can be ignored\" (Gamson, 1990, p. 87) . Provocative language stemming from a low-status communicator is likely appraised as less credible, as less interesting, and ultimately as unable to engage audiences. By contrast, when high-status actors challenge norms (even within legal frameworks), they are less likely to be penalized for their contraventions than their low-status counterparts (Devine and Caughlin, 2014) . For example, when noticing aggression in social media communications, observers are likely to attribute the communicator's reaction to \"significant situational provocations\" (legitimizing the act) for those of high status but as \"crossing the impropriety\" (and delegitimizing it) for those of low status (Geddes and Callister, 2007, p. 734) . Thus, audiences considering engaging with a provocative post from a high-status venture can expect their engagement to be noticed by others, to be evaluated as credible, and to contribute to a desired online image (Toubia and Stephen, 2013) . By contrast, engaging with provocative posts by low-status ventures could do the opposite-that is, their engagement goes unnoticed by others, is evaluated as lacking credibility, and contributes little to (or even damages) the desired image.",

However, this negative reaction to an audience member's engagement with a provocation is less threatening when it comes from high-status ventures because these ventures (and presumably audiences that engage with them) are granted more leeway in deviating from norms (e.g., Kohn, 1989; Phillips and Zuckerman, 2001; Swigert and Farrell, 1977) .",

Additionally, because an audience member's endorsement of a post is likely to carry more weight when the content is provocative than when it is not (akin to taking sides in an argument), endorsing provocative material, compared with non-provocative material, is likely to strengthen the ingratiating effect of engaging with the post's originator (discussed in Section 3). As audiences give more importance to ingratiating with actors of high status (than those of low status), the benefits associated with endorsing provocative material are greater when originating from those of high status.

We sampled internet ventures because of their affinity for using social media (e.g., Ho et al., 2020; Ho and Vogel, 2014; Schiavone et al., 2014) . We used data from CrunchBase, a widely adopted VC-funding database in management research (e.g., Block and Sandner, 2009; Ter Wal et al., 2016) because of its focus on tracking US internet industry ventures (especially Web 2.0 companies) (Block and Sandner, 2009) . To capture authoritative venture capitalists who could consecrate a venture, we focused on ventures that reported funding by venture capitalists from the 2011 listing of reputable VC firms introduced by Lee et al. (2011). 8 This sampling allowed us to compare audience reactions to tweets by ventures that have varying statuses but that are otherwise relatively homogeneous (i.e., VC-funded and not-yet-VC-funded ventures). We cleaned the data and retained only ventures for which the application programming interface (API) calls successfully retrieved information on their Twitter accounts. We eliminated ventures that did not meet a minimum activity threshold of 10 tweets. We further eliminated tweets that were retweets themselves to avoid confounding other authors' Twitter narrative styles with those of the sampled ventures. This sampling resulted in 369,142 tweets made by 268 ventures. Because the Twitter API limits the number of posts downloaded for one account to approximately 3200, we could not access tweets posted before VC funding for all sampled ventures. The final sample consists of 10,057 prefunding tweets posted by 106 ventures and 359,085 post-funding tweets posted by all 268 ventures. 9",

CATA is an established approach within the entrepreneurship literature (e.g., Anglin et al., 2018b; Seigner et al., 2022) . Following this approach, we began deductively, identifying existing constructs in the management and entrepreneurship literature relevant to provocation (Short et al., 2010) . The construct previously operationalized that was most similar to provocation was nonconformance-to \"act against or in contradiction to the prevailing standards, attitudes, practices, etc., of society or a group\" (Hubbard et al., 2018 (Hubbard et al., , p. 1983) ) or to \"question, change, or violate the social structure\" (Zimmerman and Zeitz, 2002, p. 422) . We thus complemented the existing dictionary of nonconforming terms used in traditional media when reporting on firms developed by Hubbard et al. (2018) (which included words like misfit, rebel, and revolution) with the terms question, change, and violate. 11 After that, we included all these previously mentioned terms' synonyms (using a thesaurus).",

The first author coded all 21,438 words with a frequency of 1000 (approximately 10 % of all words) within the subsample to identify relevant words-such as riot, wtf, and jailbreak-for our dictionary (e.g., jailbreak reflects tweeting about removing software restrictions in order to access paid software for free). To analyze face validity, we checked terms that might have several contextual meanings in ventures' online posts. Based on the central limit theorem, we inspected 30 random tweets for each such term to ensure that the flagged posts represented provocative language (i.e., expressions of aggression, disobedience toward regulations, use of swear words, antagonism, or other types of challenging social norms). An exemplary term eliminated within this process is challenge because, in the context of ventures' social media posts, the word also referred to start-up competitions instead of challenges to the status quo.",

Three of the authors independently coded each term, after which we used these codes to calculate intercoder reliability. After this iterative process, Cohen's kappa was 0.98 for the dictionary. According to Landis and Koch (1977, p. 165) , this magnitude of Cohen's kappa qualifies as \"almost perfect.\" We also assessed convergent validity-that is, \"the extent to which the computer-aided text analytic word lists measure the construct of interest similarly to other validated measures of the same or a related construct\" (McKenny et al., 2013, p. 167 ). There should be some correlation, though not above 0.5, given that this would indicate the need to collapse to a single measure (Short et al., 2010) . Here, we can compare provocative language with dictionaries capturing anger and negative emotions from the established linguistic software Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (e.g., Pennebaker et al., 2015) . Correlations of provocative language with anger of 0.30 (p < 0.001) and negative emotions of 0.37 (p < 0.001) suggest that provocative language is a valid yet distinct measure.",

(2018) developed their dictionary in a context where the general media write about firms rather than in a context of firms' own communications, we checked each of the 29 words in their dictionary for face validity in the context of ventures' tweets. We eliminated all terms that were not provocative (e.g., differ, difference, different, dissimilar, distinct, original, rate, unlike, varied) . However, we still report this step because their efforts were helpful as a first dictionary-based approach to studying a construct similar to provocative language. Additionally, the terms question and change were only a starting point and were deemed non-provocative in the subsequent process of developing our dictionary. In Appendix A.1, we report all the terms in our final dictionary and italicize the words we retained from the Hubbard et al. (2018) nonconformance dictionary. proceeded by the \"@\" character), as embedded content can be associated with social media engagement measures, such as retweets (Park and Kaye, 2019) . We also control for the number of hashtags, such as \"#entrepreneur\" (Suh et al., 2010) ; word count with the total number of words within the focal tweet (Lee et al., 2018) ; and emotional language (Berger and Milkman, 2012; Heimbach and Hinz, 2016 ) by using LIWC (e.g., Tausczik and Pennebaker, 2010) to capture expressions of positive emotions, negative emotions, anxiety, anger, and sadness. Acknowledging the effect of gendered language in entrepreneurship (e.g., Lundmark et al., 2022; Wesemann and Wincent, 2021) , we further employ LIWC to control for female expressions, such as mum or girl, and male expressions, such as dad or boy. We operationalize the variable time to/since founding as the difference between when a tweet was posted and the venture's founding date.",

Accordingly, we wanted to determine whether there are differences in the effects of particular subdimensions (e.g., swearing) of provocative language. 13 We thus inductively coded all words within our initially established word list and identified five distinct subdimensions included in our dictionary of provocative language. These are words expressing aggression, disobedience toward regulations, use of swear words, antagonism, and other types of the challenging of norms. Appendix A.1 shows how our words are + p < 0.1. 13 We thank an anonymous reviewer for the idea of identifying and analyzing heterogeneity within our dictionary. categorized into these subdimensions, and Appendix A.2 provides exemplary tweets to better illustrate the subdimensions. Table 3 (Models 1 and 2) details the results for the subdimensions of provocative language and their interactions (Models 3 and 4) with VC funding in explaining audience engagement on social media. The results suggest that expressions referring to aggression, disobedience toward regulations, and antagonism seem to be the strongest drivers of the positive interaction between VC funding and provocative framing for both likes and retweets. Swear words were less effective (i.e., they show a positive and significant interaction for likes, but not for retweets), and expressions referring to other types of challenging norms were not significant. Additionally, we recognize that whereas consecration is an important event that shifts a venture's status, there are also other types of status markers 14 or gradients of status among the consecrated ventures in our sample. Transferring the notion of superstar status of entrepreneurs (Obschonka et al., 2017) , some ventures also obtain funding from 'superstar' venture capitalists, described by practitioners as the top tier (e.g., Dealroom.co, 2021; Espinal, 2013) , which might be reflected in even higher status. Accordingly, we examined status using a categorical variable that distinguishes between ventures without VC funding, ventures with VC funding from a venture capitalist in the bottom 80 % of the Lee et al. (2011) index, and ventures with VC funding from at least one venture capitalist in the top 20 % of the index (please see Models 5-8 in online Appendix B.2 for more details). 15 Slope-difference tests revealed that the differences in estimates between the tiers were significant in all models (p < 0.05). In summary, we found positive and significant main effects of VC funding that were also significantly higher for funding by a venture capitalist at the top of the index versus VC funding in general. Similarly, we found positive and significant interactions, with the positive effect of provocative language on audience engagement being more positive when a venture was funded by a venture capitalist at the top of the index versus funded by a lowerranked VC. 16",

                "text": "Finally, we ran pooled random-effects Poisson estimations using the Chamberlain-Mundlak approach to more closely approximate fixed effects. We included more venture-level controls here because random-effects estimation does not automatically control for timeinvariant omitted variables. We controlled for the total number of Twitter followers at the time of data retrieval of the respective venture (Albrecht et al., 2020) . 18 We further controlled for total funding amount, total funding rounds, and venture founding location, all taken from Crunchbase, and we included a dummy variable specifying whether the tweets were sent by a business-to-business (B2B) or by a business-to-consumer (B2C) venture. The location is operationalized with dummy variables for the US states. The Chamberlain-Mundlak approach also includes, besides the initial covariates, the averages of the time-varying variables as controls. The results fully support our initial findings. 14 Beyond acquiring status via a consecrating event such as obtaining VC funding, new ventures can also increase social standing in other ways, such as over time. Therefore, we conducted further analyses to examine the effect of this alternative status proxy (please see Models 1-4 in online Appendix B.2 for more details). The interactions between provocative language and venture age in explaining audience engagement on social media are consistent with our initial results using VC funding as a proxy for venture status. 15 Because 20 % is an arbitrary boundary, we ran the same regression with the top 10 %, and the results remained consistent (please see Models 9-12 in online Appendix B.2 for more details). 16 Additionally, we followed a reviewer's suggestion to look for differences between business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) ventures. Results indicated, at least with marginal significance, that B2B ventures, in contrast to B2C ventures, do not increase audience engagement by employing provocative language in their tweets, and that the positive effect of VC funding on audience engagement on social media is more positive for B2B ventures than for B2C ventures (please see Models 13-16 in online Appendix B.2 for more details). 17 In additional robustness checks, we ran our initial models (1) using only the 106 ventures where we had pre-and post-VC funding tweets to check for within-venture differences (please see Models 21-24 in online Appendix B.3 for more details); (2) using all ventures, regardless of being listed on the VC index, to use a more generous sampling strategy (online Appendix B.3, see Models 25-28); and (3) using our main sample but Winsorizing our dependent variables at the 99th percentile to mitigate the effect of outliers (online Appendix B.3; see Models 29-32). 18 We, alternatively, replaced time to/since founding in our initial models with a time \u00d7 followers count at the time of data retrieval interaction or log (time+1) \u00d7 followers count at the time of data retrieval interaction, including the respective main effects, as additional controls to better model growth in followership over time. This is because the Twitter API only permits gathering the account's number of followers at the time of data retrieval, a limitation we share with similar studies (e.g., Albrecht et al., 2020; Antretter et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2017; Yang and Berger, 2017) . Approximating follower growth this way, we found no substantive change in the results when we included either of these controls (please see Models 9-16 in online Appendix B.3 for more details). To account for discontinuities in time effects, we also included year-quarter dummies as additional controls (online Appendix B.3; see Models 17-20).",

However, there is limited research on how new ventures can communicate effectively on these platforms, and entrepreneurs may be tempted to imitate the social media behavior of superstar entrepreneurs (Obschonka et al., 2013 (Obschonka et al., , 2017) ) or rely on findings from other contexts, which suggest that provocative communication drives audience engagement online.

Not only do tweets from new ventures attract more audience engagement when these ventures have gained status by having acquired VC funding; the differences in status also affect the relationship between provocative language and audience engagement on Twitter: in tweets by low-status ventures, provocative language decreased audience engagement, whereas in tweets by high-status ventures, provocative language increased audience engagement. Our post-hoc tests revealed that there are nuances in the gradients of status and that the underlying interaction effect was driven mainly by provocative language expressing aggression, disobedience toward regulations, and antagonism. We further discovered that social media engagement was positively associated with second-funding-round performance. With these findings, we contribute to studies on new-venture communication with external audiences, including the nascent entrepreneurship literature around audience engagement on social media, and to the conversation around the nonfinancial effects of VC funding.",

Ventures should tell attractive stories about themselves to increase market acceptance (Martens et al., 2007; Pan et al., 2020) . However, ventures increasingly use social media to communicate with external audiences (e.g., Fischer and Reuber, 2011, 2014; Howard et al., 2021) . In this context, there are indications that different rules apply for what constitutes effective communication (Etter et al., 2019) . Superstar entrepreneurs' tweets tend to display a \"rulebreaking\" attitude (Obschonka et al., 2017) , and such provocative online communication approaches have been found to increase audience engagement with established politicians (Boulianne and Larsson, 2021; Fine and Hunt, 2021) or brands (e.g., Sabri, 2017) . We, too, found that provocative language can be positively associated with audience engagement on social media. However, we also discovered circumstances where provocative language was negatively associated with audience engagement. As we theorized, status is an important boundary condition of the relationship between provocative language and audience engagement on social media. Our findings thus validate previously documented positive effects of provocative language on social media engagement for comparatively high-status communicators (brands, companies, and politicians) while also demonstrating how provocative language can have the opposite effect. The latter is especially crucial in early-stage entrepreneurship, where high status cannot be taken for granted (Milanov and Shepherd, 2013) and ventures need to especially consider their liabilities of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965) .",

Roccapriore and Pollock, 2022) . Our results, including our post-hoc analyses, reveal that (1) characteristics of the venture, such as whether they are VC-funded, and even the more nuanced ranking of their funding venture capitalists, as well as (2) characteristics of the message, such as how it is linguistically framed, affect audience engagement with newventure posts. Furthermore, our results show that the tendencies of social media audiences to engage with ventures' posts seem determined not only by the individual effects of such characteristics but also by their interactions. For example, social media audiences engage with posts including provocative language differently depending on whether the posting venture is of high status or of low status. This implies that on social media, as in other entrepreneurial online settings (e.g., Seigner et al., 2022) and in offline contexts (e. g., Rhee and Fiss, 2014) , theorizing audience reactions to social media communication should consider not only factors influencing communication separately but also their potential interdependencies.",

Our study extends this strand of VC research by providing evidence that (1) VC funding is a valuable status marker that carries over to the social media context, and (2) VC funding also influences audience reactions to ventures' provocative language on social media. While research has suggested that some status markers can transfer from off-to online contexts (Levina and Arriaga, 2014) , our study provides empirical evidence that VC funding is an offline event that has implications for social media (Wang et al., 2021) . On this basis, our post-hoc analysis hints at further such links between off-and online contexts. Namely, social media engagement between financing rounds is positively associated with monetary performance offline (i.e., the funding amount in the second round). Taken together, these findings extend our current knowledge of the interdependence between the off-and online spaces for new ventures in the context of their VC funding.",

As discussed, the potential audience for a post is unknown a priori, audience diversity is part of social media, and the possibility of customizing posts is limited (e.g., Fischer and Reuber, 2011) . Still, sub-audiences might react differently to provocative language. One of our post-hoc analyses indicated that, compared with B2C ventures, posts by B2B ventures might not increase audience engagement by using provocative language. If B2B and B2C ventures have different audiences, this finding implies that sub-audiences might hold different standards. Future research could examine whether and why audience characteristics influence reactions to new ventures' social media communication. It would also be interesting to see how audience differences across platforms influence our studied effects, for example by investigating more professional contexts for social media audiences on platforms such as LinkedIn.",

We addressed this issue by controlling for ventures' (traditional) media visibility and, in our robustness checks, interacting the number of followers of a venture at the moment of data retrieval with venture age to approximate the development in the number of followers over time. Furthermore, we used quarterly dummies to account for potential discontinuities. We consistently found robust results. Still, our approaches remain approximations.

While we thus want to be careful not to claim that our findings apply equally to other settings, extending our results might have implications for the effects of provocation on audience engagement in political science and marketing (e.g., Boulianne and Larsson, 2021; Fine and Hunt, 2021; Sabri, 2017) . If we would, more generally, acknowledge that the status of social media users is an important factor in how provocation influences their audience engagement, this boundary condition could potentially extend to politicians and brands, too. However, in polarized contexts, such as politics (e.g., Hare and Poole, 2014; Poole and Rosenthal, 1984) , what is considered provocative varies between political ideologies (e.g., Kalmoe, 2014) , and the risks and rewards of provocation may vary depending on whom the provocation addresses (e.g., attacking those in one's own party may be risky, whereas attacking someone in a rival party may carry little risk of serious pushback, at least among those who share the communicator's political beliefs). Therefore, it would be interesting for future research to adjust our theorizing and transfer it to other contexts, such as politics and marketing, to examine the generalizability of our insights through further empirical studies.",

While we found that provocative language was positively associated with a tweet's engagement for VC-funded ventures, this does not mean (1) that provocative language is the only potential influencing factor or that (2) provocative language is an advisable dominant strategy in the long run. Indeed, marketing studies show that positive and emotional language drive the sharing of content online even when controlling for the content's nature (Berger and Milkman, 2012; Milkman and Berger, 2014) . In this regard, entrepreneurship research has documented that, on average, entrepreneurs talk more positively on Twitter than the general population (Tata et al., 2017) , although without assessing the effectiveness of their approach with respect to social media engagement. Interestingly, our control variable for positive emotional language indicated that positive framing slightly decreased engagement for the ventures in our sample.",

In this pursuit, we theorized and found that venture status plays an important role in such a communication strategy. High status, which we operationalized as having received VC funding, leads to increased audience engagement with a venture's posts and influences how social media audiences respond to provocative tweets. While tweets by VC-funded ventures attracted more engagement when they contained provocative language, such language decreased audience engagement with tweets by non-VCfunded ventures.

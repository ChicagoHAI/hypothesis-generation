    "abstract": "Twitter is not only a social network, but also an increasingly important news media. In Twitter, retweeting is the most important information propagation mechanism, and supernodes (news medias) that have many followers are the most important information sources. Therefore, it is important to understand the news retweet propagation from supernodes and predict news popularity quickly at the very first few seconds upon publishing. Such understanding and prediction will benefit many applications such as social media management, advertisement and interaction optimization between news medias and followers. In this paper, we identify the characteristics of news propagation from supernodes from the trace data we crawled from Twitter. Based on the characteristics, we build a news popularity prediction model that can predict the final number of retweets of a news tweet very quickly. Through trace-driven experiments, we then validate our prediction model by comparing our predicted popularity and real popularity, and show its superior performance in comparison with the regression prediction model. From the study, we found that the average interaction frequency between the retweeters and the news source is correlated with news popularity. Also, the negative sentiment of news has some correlations with retweet popularity while the positive sentiment of news does not have such obvious correlation.",

                "text": "Predicting news popularity on Twitter is critically important from many aspects. There are many different news agencies on Twitter such as CNN and BBC. Each news agency publishes dozens of news tweets every day and it takes a long time to read all of them. Many of the news portal websites already have the mechanism to recommend the most popular news to users based on the pageviews. However, these recommendation mechanisms are based on the pageviews that have already occurred, so the recommendations are not timely, especially when we consider the time effectiveness of news. Also, it benefits advertisement. Since each news tweet is followed by a URL pointing to a web page, more popular news means more pageviews in the future and a higher value for advertisement. The news popularity prediction enables the companies to maximize revenue through differential pricing for access to contents with different popularity.",

                "text": "Instead of obtaining followers by friendship, many supernodes in Twitter obtained many followers contributed by their influence. The most influential Twitter accounts belong to the news agencies. For example, CNNBRK has 8,867,029 followers on September 29th, 2012. 50 percent of the retweets are from supernodes (Shaomei, Jake, Winter, & Duncan, 2011) , while previous works paid little attention on it. Thus, in this work, we focus on the top news agencies accounts on Twitter. We study Twitter's news propagation characteristics, based on which, we develop a Twitter news popularity prediction model. Our work makes three main contributions: (1) We collected data from Twitter and analyzed the propagation characteristics of news from both macro-and micro-level perspectives. We propose an algorithm to find the parents of retweeters of a tweet, which are used to reconstruct retweet propagation topology. Here, the parents of retweeters of a tweet are the nodes which retweeters retweet the tweet from. For example, user A retweeted a tweet a generated by user B. User C is A's follower. C saw the tweet from A and then, retweeted the tweet A. Then A is the parent of C of tweet A. We study the distribution of retweets of a tweet over time. We also found that the tweet popularity is correlated with the interaction frequency between the retweeters and the supernode. Further, we discovered that the negative sentiment of news has some correlation with tweet popularity while the positive sentiment of news does not have such obvious correlation; (2) Based on our observed characteristics of retweets, we propose a news popularity prediction model based on news propagation process. The model can predict a news tweet's popularity based on the number of its retweets soon after being published. It can predict (i) the total number of retweets of a tweet only from a supernode, (ii) the number of retweets of a tweet at a certain time after it is published, (iii) the total number of retweets in a certain hop distance from a supernode, and (iv) the final total number of retweets; (3) We evaluated our popularity prediction model based on the real trace data from Twitter. We found our prediction model is accurate and its predicted results conform with the observed popularity, and it outperforms the regression prediction model in terms of prediction accuracy.",

Leskovec, Backstrom, and Kleinberg (2009) developed a framework for tracking popular, short and distinctive phrases online. Wallsten (2008) found strong evidence that the relationship between variables (e.g., audience size, blog discussion) is multidirectional in influencing viral video popularity. Broxton, Interian, Vaver, and Wattenhofer (2011) studied the influence of social networks on the propagation of YouTube videos in different categories. Sakaki, Okazaki, and Matsuo (2010) considered each Twitter user as a sensor and used machine learning method to predict the location of an earthquake. Cha, Haddadi, Benevenuto, and Gummadi (2010) presented an indepth comparison of influence of three measures (indegree of users, retweets, and mentions) of Twitter users on information propagation. Jansen, Zhang, Sobel, and Chowdury (2009) reported research results investigating Twitter as a form of electronic information propagation platform for sharing consumer opinions concerning brands by analyzing more than 150,000 tweets containing branding comments, sentiments and opinions. Krishnamurthy, Gill, and Arlitt (2008) gathered and identified distinct classes of Twitter users and their behaviors, geographic growth patterns and current size of the network.",

Hodas and Lerman (2013) found that position of exposing messages on the user-interface strongly affects social contagion and used this observation to improve the prediction of the temporal dynamics of user behavior. Szabo and Huberman (2008) used Digg and YouTube to model the increasing of votes on and views of content to predict the dynamics of individual submissions from initial data. Lerman and Hogg (2010) and Lerman and Ghosh (2010) further improved the model to predict the popularity of news on Digg, which is most similar to our work. However, their study did not pay attention to the topology reconstruction and inference of network diffusion which we will study in our paper. Sun, Rosenn, Marlow, and Lento (2009) presented an analysis of information diffusion chains in Facebook. Gargi, Lu, Mirrokni, and Yoon (2011) studied large-scale community detection over a real-world graph composed of millions of YouTube videos. Bakshy, Hofman, Mason, and Watts (2011) reconstructed a cascade in Twitter and discussed the influence of users. Unlike these works that paid little attention on the media characteristics of an online social network and equally treat every piece of information, we particularly study the popularity of news from supernodes on Twitter.",

After a user logs into Twitter, the user's timeline shows the new tweets since (s)he logged out last time, and then reminds the user the number of new tweets every 90 s on the top of the timeline. The update time is different from user to user since different users log in at different time. The user can click the top icon to obtain the new tweets. Fig. 1 shows a screenshot of a user's timeline from Twitter. The timeline includes both news from news agencies and non-news tweets from their friends. Each tweet indicates its initial publisher with its head-icon on the left. The tweets in a timeline are ordered by their publishing (i.e., creating) time. The more recent published tweet on the top of a timeline has the highest probability to be seen by users according to the normal behaviors of users.",

Then, we used Twitter stream API to trace their retweets immediately (i.e., catching the publishing time and retweeting time) and recorded the IDs of users who retweeted the news, news content, publishing time of the news and the retweeting time of the users. In this way, we collected our data from January 20th, 2012 to April 20th, 2012 and obtained about 10 4 pieces of original news and more than 10 6 retweets in which CNNBreaking (with 1071 tweets and more than 87,500 retweets) has the most tweets and retweets.

We can observe that there is a sharp increase at the very first beginning. We conjecture that this is because there is a delay after the news is published and before users see the news due to the 90 s update cycle of user timeline. Also we observed that the number of retweets of each tweet decreases exponentially after the sharp increase. Perhaps, this is because as the time goes on, the popularity and visibility (on the top of the timeline) of the news decrease and fewer people retweet it. We checked other randomly selected 8 tweets and found they also follow this phenomenon. In order to test whether it is an universal phenomenon, we chose 2231 news tweets; each having more than 200 retweets to measure the aggregate statistics. We find that the average time when the number of retweets reaches the top points is 87.31 s after publishing, which confirms our conjecture. Intuitively, the distribution of the number of retweets with the time may have two options: an exponential or power law distribution. In order to verify which option is correct, we draw Fig. 6 to see a real sample comparing with its most fitted exponential and power law distribution. As shown in Fig. 6 , the PDF and cumulative distributed function (CDF) of number of retweets is more fitted into an exponential distribution than a power law distribution obviously. Actually, if the number of retweets after 90 s follows a power law distribution, then the number of retweets will tend to be infinite as the time goes. As a fact, the older tweets tend to have larger number of retweets, which is not true, and the number of retweets tends to converge after a certain time. Therefore, we guess that the number of retweets does not follow a power law distribution. Furthermore, we used Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify whether the distribution of the number of retweets after 90 s follows an exponential distribution. The average Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic for the 2231 news tweets is 0.0264. That is, the hypothesis that it follows exponential distribution has an approximate significance level of 0.2. Thus, it approximately satisfies exponential distribution.",

We measured that over 95% of all the retweets in our dataset were created within 8000 s after their tweets are published. The life spans of different tweets of direct retweeters are similar, which confirms that it is mainly determined by the visibility (Lerman & Hogg, 2010) rather than the importance of the tweets.

For each supernode, we grouped all the original tweets based on the total number of each tweet's retweets 12 h after publishing. Fig. 7 shows the distribution of tweets based on this number of retweets. We see that the news popularity at 12 h after publishing varies widely from news to news. A handful of news become extremely popular, accumulating thousands of retweets, while most others obtain about hundreds of retweets. Taking CNNBRK as an example, about one third of tweets have 0-100 retweets, and around 34.7% of tweets have 100-400 retweets. A small percent of tweets have retweets more than 400 and 0.6% tweets have more than 1600 retweets. Such a distribution is characterized by \"inequality of popularity\". One reason for this characteristic is news contents. However, it is difficult to predict the news popularity based on new contents automatically given the wide inequality of popularity as shown in Fig. 7 . Fortunately, Fig. 5 shows similar twitting (i.e., popularity gaining) pattern for each news, which facilitates popularity prediction based on the popularity gained initially in a very short time after publishing. Granovetter (1973) indicated the strength of weak ties in information propagation, which can be used to define the strength of two nodes' relationship. Bakshy, Rosenn, Marlow, and Adamic (2012) found that weak ties are influential in the information propagation in Facebook. Next, we analyze the strength of weak ties on news propagation. The strength of ties can be measured in many different ways. We measured it by the interaction frequency between users and the news agency. Specifically, given a tweet from news source A, we get all users that retweeted the tweet. Then, for each of these users, we used the Twitter REST API to get the user's latest 20 retweets. The ratio of tweets created by source A in the 20 retweets is defined as the interaction frequency of the user with news source A for this tweet. The average interaction frequency of these users is defined as the interaction frequency of this tweet with news source A.",

We see that the number of retweets decreases as the interaction frequency increases. The correlation between the interaction frequency and the final number of retweets is -0.21, which significantly deviates from zero. Thus, a tweet retweeted by users having low interaction frequency with the supernode tends to receive more retweets finally and hence gain higher popularity. Our conjecture of the reason of this observation is that the users with low interaction with a supernode tend to only retweet important news tweets from the supernode, while users with high interaction with the supernode tend to retweet every news tweets. Therefore, if the news tweet is retweeted by more users with low interaction with the news source, then it is a sign that the news tweet may be more important. Therefore, the news tweet may receive more retweets finally. Here, we define the two end nodes of a tie can be people or news sources. A weak tie denotes a tie that the two end nodes do not interact frequently. This result verifies the weak tie theory (Bakshy et al., 2012; Granovetter, 1973) that people tend to receive important information from weak ties rather than from strong ties.",

We see that it follows power law distribution and that 93.6% of the users have less than 100 followers, while 98% of the users have less than 400 followers. Meanwhile, 1.35% of users have more 500 followers and only 0.68% of more than 1000 followers. This figure implies that a small percent of users are supernodes that own many followers. Non-supernodes constitute the majority users and they have similar number of followers.

We also verified this observation using all tweets in our trace data. Thus, we can use t 2 = 8000 when conducting M s prediction. q is determined based on the number of retweets until the Nth second after news publishing, that is, it is determined at the initial stage of propagation. T, N, , N and n u are determined offline based on trace data. In Section 4.3, we will introduce how to determine these parameters.

Fig. 4 shows that the retweeting activity of users varies over time. We then discuss the parameter N at different times, which can directly influence the retweeting activity. Since the number of online followers of a news agency cannot be obtained directly, we need to estimate it indirectly. We consider the followers of news agency are distributed among different communities (i.e., students, employers) uniformly in the Twitter social network since the news agencies have little obvious characteristics that attract particular communities. Therefore, we could use the distribution of the number of online users per hour in a day of all users on Twitter as the distribution of the number of online followers per hour in a day of a certain supernode. The former distribution can be approximated by the distribution of the average number of all tweets and retweets published per hour in a day in Twitter as shown in Fig. 11 . It is plotted based on data analysis results for a continually long time period from the Sysomos business intelligence company (Evans & Cheng, 2009) . Based on this distribution, we can calculate the number of online followers of a supernode at a certain time. For example, if the total number of a supernode's unique online followers in a day is N, then the number of its online followers at the hour 12 is N = r t N = 5%N, where r t denotes the fraction of all tweets and retweets at time T.",

Fig. 13 shows the predicted results and observed results for all news published by 4 news agencies in Fig. 7 . We measured that the predicted number of retweets have around 89% correlation with the observed numbers of retweets. Table 4 shows the correlation between prediction and observation and the slopes of the best fit lines shown in Fig. 13 for the 33 Section 4.3 introduced a method to determine the value of q. Using popularity observation from a longer time since news publishing will lead to more accurate estimation of q but longer delay, and vice versa. A more accurate estimation of q in turn leads to more accurate prediction of news popularity. We then test the effects of the length of time period used to determine q on the final prediction correlation with the observed data. Once a tweet is published, we used the observed data from the first 100 s, 200 s and so on until 2000 s to conduction prediction. We conducted prediction on all news of CNNBRK, and then calculate the prediction correlation with the observed data. The results are reported in Fig. 14 . The figure shows that the observations from a longer time period for q prediction lead to prediction correlation closer to 1, as more information generates more accurate q prediction. Thus, we should balance the prediction accuracy and the delay in prediction in order to guarantee the timely and precise prediction.",

We determine the parameters of A and B using the retweet data during 200 s after publishing, and then use the regression prediction model to predict the final number of retweets of each news tweet. We use time period twice longer for parameter estimation than in our model because the retweeting peak in the first 90 s does not satisfy an exponential distribution and we need a longer time period to more accurately determine the parameters. Table 4 shows the comparison results of our prediction model and the regression model, where S m2 and C m2 denote the slope and correlation of the regression model, respectively. We see that S m1 and C m1 are much closer to 1 than S m2 and C m2 , respectively. The average correlation and average slope of the regression model are 0.7400 and 0.6206, which are much lower than those of our model (0.9420 and 0.8613). These results show that our model predicts news Twitter popularity more accurately than the regression model, even though it only uses half time to determine the parameters.",

We noticed that the retweeting rate decreases over time. Fig. 15 shows the retweet rate distribution of one see that the retweeting rate decreases sharply during a short time after news publishing, which is abnormal. This may be caused by the reason that our model does not consider the decreasing visibility caused If tweet B is the subsequent tweet after tweet A, and B appears x time period after tweet A's appearance, we call x as tweet A's time interval before its subsequent tweet. We found that the average time interval between the publishing time of these ten news tweets and their subsequent news is 43 min, which is much shorter than our observed average time interval (i.e., 114 min) between the publishing time of news. Also, we noticed that their retweeting rate decreases sharply after their subsequent news was published. The early appearance of the subsequent tweets should be the reason for the retweeting rate decrease. We then analyze the real trace to verify our conjecture. We classified the 400 tweets based on their time interval before subsequent tweets and then calculated the average number of final retweets of each group. Fig. 16 shows the average number of final retweets of each group versus each group's time interval before the subsequent news publishing. We see that the average final number of retweets increases as the time interval increases. The result illustrates that followers tend to retweet the latest published news. This result verifies our conjecture that the time interval before the subsequent news publishing affects the final number of retweets and retweeting rate of a tweet. In our future work, we will consider the decreasing visibility of tweets over time into our prediction model.",

Supernodes are critical information source on Twitter. Therefore, understanding the news retweeting propagation from supernodes is very important for many purposes such as information management, advertisement, and social media management. In this paper, we first measured the news propagation characteristics on supernodes. Based on the characteristics, we built a news tweet popularity prediction model from both stochastic micro-level and macro-level perspectives. It can predict the total number of retweets of a tweet (i) only from a supernode, (ii) at a certain time after it is published, (iii) in a certain hop distance from a supernode, and (iv) when it saturates finally. Our trace-driven experimental results verify the high prediction accuracy of our prediction model and its superior performance in comparison with a regression prediction model. In addition, we also show the reasons for outliers in prediction. In the future, we will incorporate the news visibility consideration into the prediction model, and explore a method to more quickly estimate p 1 . Also, we will evaluate and consider the influence of different factors (e.g., the time in a day, interval between tweets, sentiment, tweet length) on the tweet popularity, and analyze the retweet robot behaviors.",

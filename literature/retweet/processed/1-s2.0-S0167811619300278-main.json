                "text": "Twitter has become an important channel for brands to communicate with customers and several brands including most of the Fortune 500 are very active on the network (Barnes, Lescault, & Homes, 2015) . Starbucks, for instance, has sent more than one hundred and thirty six thousand tweets 1 to about twelve million followers. An advantage of tweets is that, if retweeted, their message can reach large audiences at no cost to firms. For instance, 13 tweets by the automobile brand Mazda in January were retweeted 449 times by the brand's followers who themselves had 447,399 followers. 2 Similarly, a tweet (Fig. 1 ) by the restaurant chain Arby's to the singer Pharrell Williams was retweeted about 78 thousand times (Advertising Week, 2014a) . The tweet and retweets were viewed about 160 million times on social media and the Internet (Advertising Week, 2014b) thus presenting the brand as many times to audiences. Such increased exposure can lead to higher sales (The Wall Street Journal, 2017) and monetary benefits in several categories. For instance, causal investigations have shown that they can increase product sales (Kumar, Bhaskaran, Mirchandani, & Shah, 2013) , stimulate contributions to political campaigns (Petrova et al., 2016) , and increase viewer-ship of television shows (Gong, Zhang, Zhao, & Jiang, 2017) . More broadly, the literature (Stephen and Galak, 2012 ) also provides causal evidence that firm generated content on social media can increase product sales.",

People, on the other hand, may devote only few seconds to reading a tweet because they spend no more than a few minutes per day on Twitter (Advertising Week, 2014c) . Tweets, therefore, have to be composed so as to attract attention and facilitate recognition of their topics even if they are read rapidly and cursorily. Despite the increasing interest in Twitter as a medium (Malhotra, Malhotra, & See, 2012) and in the role of tweets' content on retweets (Araujo, Neijens, & Vliegenthart, 2015) , there are few insights in the literature into this.",

(2012) for instance recommend that brands should compose tweets to followers so as to attract attention that will \"make them read\" the tweet. The specific approach they recommend is to include words like \"WOW\", \"LOOK\" or \"TODAY ONLY!\" (p. 64) at the start of the tweet. Their approach thus relies on surprising and creating a sense of urgency to attract attention and reading. Recent findings (Zhang, Moe, & Schweidel, 2016) however demonstrate that retweets are driven more by whether people see a fit between a tweet's topic and what they like to tweet about. The challenge for brands, however, is the little time that people spend on Twitter and individual tweets. As a result, a tweet may not even be read fully and people may not realize that it is on a topic that they like to share by retweeting. There is therefore a real need for brands' social media managers to understand how to compose a tweet to help followers recognize its topic even if it is only scanned and not read fully. This is the gap that we address in this research.",

                "text": "Our investigation is based on findings in the psycholinguistics literature that, when people do not put much effort into reading, they may just comprehend a sentence by scanning a subset of words (Rayner, Alexander, Jane, & Charles Jr, 2012) . In the context of tweets therefore people may not retweet unless, early in the scanning process, they see topic-related words (Griffiths, Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2007) that lead them to conclude that the tweet is on a topic of interest. For instance, followers interested in social interactions (Lovett, Peres, & Shachar, 2013) may only retweet the Arby's tweet if they see the word Grammysa topic that can stimulate conversations about the awards with friends. The tweet may therefore have to be composed such that words related to the Grammy's are likely to be spotted soon after scanning begins so that the reader does not lose interest in reading further. Additionally, because comprehension requires a subset of words to be scanned, additional words that are semantically related to the Grammy's (Griffiths et al., 2007) may have to be included at different points in the tweet. This would increase the likelihood that they are also scanned and the topic is comprehended. Our research is aimed at investigating whether composing tweets based on such principles can increase retweets. Specifically, we investigate whether locating topic-related words earlier in the tweet and increasing the number of those words in the tweet can increase retweets.",

                "text": "We conduct our investigation in three phases. In phase 1, we focus on sales promotional tweets (SPTs) among the tweets by sixty-two brands in four categories and look for prima facie evidence that early location of and higher space devoted to topicrelated words in tweets affect retweets. Data for this includes tweets posted over a fifteen month period between February 4th, 2011 and April 26th, 2012, by 62 brands in the automobile, food and beverage, dining, and airline categories. Based on evidence from this phase, we use propensity score matching methods (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983 ) in a second phase to investigate whether early location of and space devoted to topic-related words in these tweets cause retweets. Results from this phase provide evidence of causality. Finally, in phase three, we use a subset of a large corpus of about 1.77 million topic-author controlled tweets that arise form a natural experiment on Twitter (Tan, Lee, & Pang, 2014) to rule out endogeneity and investigate the generalizability of the causal relationship identified in phase 2. Each tweet in this data has a pair on the same topic and by the same author but the two tweets differ in their composition. Further, most authors of the tweets in this dataset are individuals and the tweets cover thousands of topics. For instance, a sample of 18,406 tweets that we investigate from this data included 4671 unique topics following the \"#\" symbol in the tweets. Collectively, these features allow us to reliably address the issues of endogeneity and generalizability. Specifically, because the tweets are by individuals rather than brands, brand managers' expertise in composing SPTs to increase retweets as an alternative explanation for our findings in phases 1 and 2 can be ruled out if our findings are replicated with this data. Additionally, because tweets by individuals are likely to be on topics other than what brands are likely to tweet about and also because of the large number of unique topics, replication of our findings from the first two phases in this phase will also demonstrate the generalizability of our findings. We choose sales promotions as the topic for the phase 1 investigation because it offers both theoretical and managerial advantages. Theoretically, the literature on topic models (Griffiths et al., 2007) indicates that topics are categorized in human memory as a set of frequently occurring topic-related words. Given its extensive use by businesses, and the frequent use of words and phrases like \"free\" and \"free gift\", sales promotions are likely to be categorized as a topic consisting of such words. Tweets on sales promotions which include these frequently used words would therefore help us investigate whether early location of and more space devoted to topic-related words increase retweets. Managerially, as well, analyzing retweets of SPT\"s is useful because our findings can increase the response to the promotions. Additionally, if the retweets reach people who do not follow the brand but follow its followers, their interest in the brand may be stimulated converting them also into followers of the brand. This can increase future sales (The Wall Street Journal, 2017; Twitter, 2018) . 3There have been other investigations of retweets in the literature. For instance, Malhotra et al. (2012) develop recommendations for how to increase retweets based on a descriptive analysis of a sample of 1150 tweets. Zhang et al. (2016) also investigate retweets but focus on how the fit between a tweet's topic and the audience's retweeting interests plays a role. Our research thus adds to these investigations. Specifically, the primary contribution of our research is in demonstrating that the locations of and space devoted to topic-related words in tweets affect retweets. We also demonstrate the business value of our findings by collecting and investigating additional data on how retweets affect the number of followers of the brands that we study in phases 1 and 2. Findings from this investigation show that an increase in retweets also increases the number of followers of the brands. Because an increase in the number of followers also increases the number of retweets (Araujo et al., 2015) , increasing retweets through better composition of tweets should have positive dynamic effects on future retweets and hence the business benefits of retweets (Gong et al., 2017 , Kumar et al., 2013 , Petrova et al., 2016) such as sales (The Wall Street Journal, 2017; Twitter, 2018) .",

Following this, we present results from our investigations in phases 2 and 3. The paper concludes with a section that empirically demonstrates that retweets of brands' tweets increase the number of followers, a discussion of the contributions and limitations of our work, and directions for future research. et al. (2012) were one of the early investigators of retweets and find that they are higher for shorter tweets and tweets that include the request to retweet #RT_if. Additionally, they find that sales promotional tweets that include timesensitive announcements (e.g., \"\u2026 Friday, March 4. Stay tuned for details\") get more retweets.",

This research is also relevant to our work because it can provide insights into factors that increase the diffusion (Stephen & Lehmann, 2016) of messages (or tweets in our case). Some examples of research into the transmission of messages in online networks include Chae, Stephen, Bart, and Yao (2016) , Stephen and Lehmann (2016), and Zubcsek and Sarvary (2011) . Chae et al. (2016) investigate message propagation in seeded marketing campaigns or SMC's. Their specific goals are understanding whether messages sent by influencers selected by firms to write about specific products on social media stimulate discussion of those and related products among the non-seeded population. Their study of 39 SMC's finds that word of mouth about the product does spread but spills over into word of mouth about other products from the firms as well as about the entire product category of the seeded products. In our context, however, Chae et al.'s (2016) findings suggest that tweets by influential brands that have more followers than other brands, or more fans on social media platforms like Facebook, are more likely to be retweeted. Our empirical results, in fact, confirm this.",

Findings suggest that reading and comprehension of a sentence of text happens sequentially in two stages. The reading stage itself proceeds in a series of paired eye movements (Rayner et al., 2012, p.91) in which the first movement is a saccade (Matin, 1974) or superficial scanning of the sentence during which some words may be entirely skipped. Further, little or no comprehension of the scanned words occurs during a saccade (Matin, 1974 , Rayner et al., 2012, p.91) . The second movement is a fixation (Dearborn, 1906 , Frazier & Rayner, 1982) or focusing of the eyes on the first word to the right of the last scanned character. After this word is read, the next saccade-fixation pair begins. Such saccade-fixation pairs take place in very short time intervals of about 20 -35 milliseconds per saccade and between 150 and 500 milliseconds per fixation (Rayner et al., 2012, p.91 ) and go on until the end of the sentence is reached.",

This is particularly likely when people have modest goals for the reading task (Rayner et al., 2012, p.242) . For instance, they may not fixate on all the words of the sentence, understand their meanings, and then comprehend the sentence's syntactic and grammatical structure for its meaning. Instead, they may scan the sentence, fixate on just a few words and arrive at a meaning without ever decoding the syntax or grammar. Since the goals of interacting with tweets are also likely to be modest rather than highly significant, reading them may also be based on such heuristics. If words related to tweeting interests occur more often in the tweet, therefore, the likelihood of followers locating them as they scan it, fixating on them, and using them to comprehend the tweet should also increase. This in turn should increase retweets by those whose tweeting interests have a fit with what the tweet's topic is about.",

The topic associated with a word in turn is based on whether the word belongs to the group of semantically similar words that people categorize as a topic. An additional factor is the probability that they assign to whether the word is topic-related based on its frequency of occurrence in past encounters with that topic. Readers next use the tentatively identified topic to predict other words that they might encounter as they continue to read (Griffiths & Steyvers, 2003) . Subsequently read words are then comprehended as adding additional meaning to the topic identified thus far unless those words appear to be part of a different topic in which case the inferred topic might itself be revised.",

If, however, the word \"stream\" is also encountered, the word \"bank\" may be used to conclude that the topic may be related to rivers leading to the expectation of words like \"woods\" and \"field\" rather than \"federal\" and \"reserve\". The two key features of Griffiths et al. (2007) model are therefore that (1) readers start inferring the topic of a text as soon as they read a word and (2) the inferred topic has dynamic effects on readers' predictions of other topic-related words that are likely to occur and leads them to look for those words. Thus, in the case of a tweet, early occurrence of a topic-related word and the scanning for additional occurrences of other words related to the topic would lead to the conclusion that the tweet is about that topic if these words do occur. In light of Zhang et al.'s (2016) findings that people are more likely to retweet if tweets are on topics that they are interested in, therefore, early and multiple occurrences of topic-related words in a tweet should increase retweets by those interested in the topic.",

From the words that occur at least 50 times, we select those that are likely to be used in sales promotions that offer non-monetary incentives like free gifts rather than monetary incentives. There were seven such words: chance, commercial, free, gift, giveaway, promo and win. The word sale also occurred more than 50 times. Despite its association with price reductions, we include this word also in this category because it could also be used in sales promotions that do not offer price reductions.",

If people categorize St. Patrick's Day with words related to cultural events, retweets of the SPT could also be affected by their (dis)interest in the topic.

As mentioned previously, our objective in phase 1 is to investigate for prima facie evidence that the number and locations of topic-related words in tweets affect retweets. The objective of phase 2 is to investigate whether the share and locations of promotional words in these tweets cause retweets. Both phases are therefore used for evidence that either supports or refutes the role of the location of and space devoted to topic-related words in retweets. In phase 3 where we test for the reliability and generalizability of the prima facie evidence, however, we do not define topics based on the frequency of occurrence of words that we view as semantically similar. Instead, we define the topic of a tweet in this phase as the word following the \"#\" symbol.

Previous findings in the literature (Malhotra et al., 2012) however indicate that the length of a tweet has a negative effect on retweets. This may be indicative that early occurrence of topics in longer tweets plays a larger role in retweets than in shorter tweets. A topic that occurs at the 20th character in a tweet of 140 characters for instance may be more effective in generating retweets than one that occurs at the 20th character of a tweet that is 40 characters long. Because tweets can vary in length, we therefore measure the location of the first occurrence of a topic-related word as the ratio of the number of characters from the start of the tweet where the word begins and the tweet's total length in characters. Thus, for instance, if the first word from the promotional-words category appears at the 35th character of the tweet and the tweet is 140 characters long, we set Loc i, Prom to 0.25. If no word from a category is present in the tweet, we set the location for that category to zero. This ensures that this category has no effect on the number of retweets. We operationalize the space devoted in a tweet to words from each of the five categories as the share of the total number of characters in the tweet occupied by characters in the words from the categories that appear in the tweet. Thus, for instance, the share of occurrence of any of the eight words for the promotional-words category (Table 4 ) is operationalized as:",

Similarly, the acronym 'RT_if' alerts the reader that the sender is requesting a retweet. Likewise, the presence of one or multiple '$' signs may signal a sales promotion. Tweets cam also include multiple blank spaces that readers can complete. A tweet that includes multiple blank spaces which may have to be filled in before retweeting however can also take more time to read. Because some or all of these characteristics can affect the number of retweets (Malhotra et al., 2012) , we define indicator variables I i (#), I i (RT if ), I i ($), and I i (blanks) (for any sequence of multiple blank spaces in the tweet). Additionally, because links to videos and photos increase retweets (Araujo et al., 2015) , we also define an indicator variable I i (HTTP) for the presence of such links in the tweet.",

For instance, the treated tweet could have been sent at a time when there is substantially more interest in promotions by the tweeting brand than when the control tweet was sent. Because this is not observed and hence not controlled by us, the larger number of retweets of the treated tweet would be incorrectly causally attributed to the higher share and/or location of promotion related words.

Both tweets are on the same topic but are composed differently while using several words that might be common to both.

The gap of at least 24 h should reduce the likelihood that the second tweet is seen as repetitive and ignored by the audience. Similarly, limiting the gap to 48 h should reduce the possibility that the second tweet gets more retweets because the first tweet's topic is forgotten and the second tweet is seen as new by the readers. Additionally, we only select a pair of tweets if it deals with exactly a single and same topicas indicated by the occurrence of a hashtag followed by the same string of continuous characters in both tweets.

One, they should monitor retweets of their tweets on the topic and identify the tweets that performed well on retweets. For instance, these could be tweets that receive more than the average number of retweets over all tweets on the topic. They should then compile a list of topic-related words in those tweets. Two, they should complement the lists of topic-related words compiled from approach one by monitoring tweets on the same topic by competitors. Topic-related words in competitors' tweets that receive more than the average number of retweets on all tweets on the topic by them should then be added to the internally formed lists. Third, they should run experiments by using alternative topic-related words to compose tweets on the same topic and select words from tweets that perform better on retweets. This approach is thus similar to the topic-author controlled experiments illustrated in Tan et al. (2014) .",

For instance, words related to promotions may play a larger role in the retweets of more expensive categories where promotions may be less frequent than in other categories. Similarly, the effects could also differ across brands based on how active they are on other social media. For instance, brands that post a large number of messages on Facebook may not generate as many retweets if several of their followers on Twitter are also fans on Facebook. We also do not investigate if the role of the locations of and space devoted to topic-related words in retweets depends on when the tweet is posted. For instance, it is possible that people are more interested in interacting with tweets during the evenings when they have more time for social interactions. If this is the case, the role of topic-related words may be stronger in the mornings than during evenings. Thus, earlier locations of topic-related words in the tweet might have a more positive effect during the day when people are likely to be busier than during the evenings and weekends.",

For instance, a recent tweet by the restaurant chain McDonald's on December 10, 2018 (Fig. 4 ) includes two distinct topics: the description of a sandwich and the introduction of the sandwich as a new product. Such multi-topic tweets are more likely because tweets can include up to 280 characters as opposed to the 140 character limit previously.

Investigations of the interplay between network structures and the composition of tweets in retweets gained by tweets is therefore another direction to build on our work. Related to the above issue is an additional promising avenue for research that links messaging by brands through Twitter with their paid efforts for the same messages through advertising.

Specifically, their interest is in investigating whether firms' that can communicate with social networks would be taking sub-optimal decisions on their paid advertising efforts if they ignore the word of mouth about those messages in the network. Their analytical results confirm that this will be the case. These findings suggest a promising direction for research.

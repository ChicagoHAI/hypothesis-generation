Second, drawing on previous research in interactive marketing and advertising in the context of crafting viral tweets, we develop a theoretical framework depicting the factors that are theorised to increase consumer engagement with brand tweets, as demonstrated by retweeting those tweets. Third, we describe our data collection and analysis approach. Finally, we present the results of our analysis and discuss the implications for organisations' Twitter strategies and for research.",

WOM is perceived as more authentic, less biased, and thus has higher credibility than advertising messages (e.g. Bristor, 1990; Keller, 2007) . However, organisations have often struggled to systematically manage WOM because it is often generated by factors beyond firms' control (Haywood, 1989) . In addition, the difficulty of measuring face-to-face WOM adds to the challenges in using WOM for marketing (Christiansen & Tax, 2000) .",

Before the advent of social media, eWOM was defined as: any positive or negative statement made by potential, actual, or former customers about a product or company, which is made available to a multitude of people and institutions via the Internet. (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2004, p. 39) Since that period, however, advances in digital technology in the past decade have vastly increased both the ways in which eWOM can be transmitted, and its importance as a marketing channel. In response, research into oWOM/eWOM has progressed from a focus on 'legacy' forms of eWOM, such as consumer statements through product ratings and reviews, to incorporate newer forms of eWOM such as engaging on social media platforms (e.g. by likes, comments, shares, retweets and favourites) (Lamberton & Stephen, 2016) . Although such eWOM often does not include the 'statement' reflected in the classic definition of eWOM, these newer forms of eWOM provide a measurable record that is available for the researcher or marketer (e.g. Dellarocas & Narayan, 2006; Kozinets, de Valck, Wojnicki, & Wilner, 2010) , thus addressing one of the major challenges to using WOM for marketing discussed above.",

Most early studies of eWOM focused on this type of consumer initiated (or peer-to-peer) eWOM (e.g. Fong & Burton, 2006; Godes & Mayzlin, 2004) . Such studies do not reflect, however, that eWOM can be created either through opinion giving or opinion passing (Chu & Kim, 2011) . That is, an individual can initiate WOM by transmitting their opinions to others, or pass on WOM received from others. There has been repeated discussion in the literature consistent with this expanded conceptualisation of eWOM (e.g. Araujo, Neijens, & Vliegenthart, 2016; Chu, Chen, & Sung, 2015; Kim, Sung, & Kang, 2014; Rosario, Sotgiu, De Valck, & Bijmolt, 2016; Zhang, Jansen, & Chowdhury, 2011) . However, surprisingly, we have not found an updated definition of eWOM reflecting its use for opinion passing, as well as opinion giving. Building on both Hennig-Thurau's et al. ( 2004) definition of eWOM and Chu and Kim's (2011) conceptualisation of eWOM on social networking sites, we therefore propose an updated definition of eWOM to incorporate its expanded use in the age of social media: a process by which potential, actual or former customers give or pass on an opinion or statement about a product or company, which is made available online, potentially to a multitude of people and institutions.",

The earliest form of such 'seeded' eWOM was probably email marketing, where an organisation's message, either implicitly or explicitly, encouraged the recipient to forward the email to their contacts. Pass-along of email messages and its measurement is, however, limited by the private nature of email. In contrast, the emergence of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, where users are easily able to create and forward brand-related information to their networks (Vollmer & Precourt, 2008) , has vastly increased the potential reach and measurability of eWOMincluding the dissemination of tweets originating from firms (e.g. Hewett, Rand, Rust, & van Heerde, 2016) . So organisations can initiate or 'seed' eWOM on social media and measure its disseminationthereby providing the opportunity to identify the characteristics of messages which are widely disseminated or 'go viral', as we discuss in the following section.",

(While it is technically possible to retweet a brand message with critical commentary, Twitter's character length, and the observed association between retweeting and positive brand evaluations (Kim et al., 2014) , retweets are likely to largely reflect positive, or at least neutral, eWOM.) Retweeting of brand tweets is, therefore, an important measure of the success of a brand in generating eWOM on Twitter, as WOM disseminates across Twitter through retweets (Walker, Baines, Dimitriu, & Macdonald, 2017) . Thus, understanding the factors that increase (or decrease) the probability of a message being retweeted is critical for effective marketing on Twitter. In the next section, we present a theoretical model summarising the factors that are expected to increase the probability that a message will be retweeted.",

Such research, however, lacks a unifying theoretical model to explain why different tweet features may increase (or decrease) retweeting. However, there is a large body of research into advertising effectiveness that is relevant for identifying factors that may influence the effectiveness of Twitter communications. Drawing on both these fields of literature, we first develop a theoretical model of factors that are likely to drive consumer engagement with brand tweets, operationalised as the frequency of retweeting (see Figure 1 ), and then go on to test that model. In the next section, we review each of these factors separately, as well as control variables that are relevant for the study.",

Although there are different definitions of interactivity (Hui & Nadda, 2014) , one widely cited source defines interactivity as 'the extent to which users can participate in modifying the messages they receive' (Steuer, 1992, p. 84) . Building on Steuer's definition, Hoffman and Novak (1996) argued that computer mediated environments (such as Twitter, though they were writing before the advent of Twitter) can allow interactivity with the medium (which they called 'machine interactivity') in addition to through a medium (which they called 'person interactivity'). While Twitter, like all social media, allows person interactivity, different Twitter design features encourage Twitter followers to interact with the medium, for example, by clicking on an embedded hyperlink in a tweet. In this study, we extend Hoffman and Novak's analysis, by analysing the extent to which interactive and other tweet features increase consumer engagement with tweets, as measured by the frequency of retweeting. Interactive features of tweets represent the first group of mechanisms to facilitate retweeting behaviour shown in Figure 1 , and in the following section, we discuss each separately.",

The presence of a hashtag in a tweet is thus an example of machine interactivity because such a tweet has a greater probability of being found by individuals who do not follow the tweet's sender, but who are sufficiently interested in the hashtag's topic to search for tweets containing that hashtag. Possibly because the use of a hashtag means that a larger number of people see the tweet, the inclusion of a hashtag in a tweet has been found to increase the retweet rate (Burton & Soboleva, 2011; Suh et al., 2010) . One recent estimate found that inclusion of a hashtag increases the retweet rate by 46% (Kerns, 2014) . However, the effect of including one or more hashtags in a tweet may be non-linear: another study found that tweets containing one to three hashtags are more likely to be retweeted than tweets without hashtags, but as the number of hashtags in a tweet grew, the average number of retweets decreased (Jenders, Kasneci, & Naumann, 2013) . Thus, Figure 1 models hashtags in a tweet as increasing the probability of retweeting, but the model tested also includes a squared and a cubic term to test for a non-linear effect of hashtags on retweeting.",

Hyperlinked tweets are considered more informative (Sedhai & Sun, 2014) and are likely to be more interesting (Alonso, Carson, Gerster, Ji, & Nabar, 2010) .

In contrast, however, two other studies have reported that inclusion of a URL did not increase retweeting (Malhotra et al., 2012; Saxton, Niyirora, Guo, & Waters, 2015) , suggesting that the effect of URL links may be less clear-cut than has been suggested by previous literature.

Mentions are also, however, a form of machine interactivity, since including a mention in a tweet results in the tweet being automatically sent to the person or brand Twitter handle. Consistent with this possibility, previous authors have examined the effect of mentions on retweet count and found varying results: either no effect of mentions on retweeting (Petrovic, Osborne, & Lavrenko, 2011) , a marginal negative effect (Suh et al., 2010) or a significant negative effect (Tan, Lee, & Pang, 2014) .",

For example, research studying linguistic and interactional features of an earlier online communication channelinternet relay chat (Werry, 1996) has discussed the value of using a person's name at the beginning of an utterance to capture the addressee's attention, in a way that a reference (or, on Twitter, a mention) later in the message may not achieve. Drawing on Werry's research, an initial mention tweet thus accomplishes what has been called 'addressivity' (Honeycutt & Herring, 2009) . As well as capturing the attention of a mentioned person (or brand) as discussed above, a mention at the start of a tweet may also capture the attention of others, if the mentioned person (or brand) is of sufficient interest, thus potentially resulting in an increased number of retweets. For instance, recent research has shown that tweets are more likely to be retweeted if they have been retweeted by an influential person, such as a celebrity (e.g. Araujo et al., 2016) . Consistent with this logic, Figure 1 models a tweet that starts with an initial mention as having a higher probability of being retweeted relative to tweets without an initial mention.",

Thus, Figure 1 proposes that the presence of a mention elsewhere in a tweet will influence the retweet rate.

The use of a clear call to action attracts attention and makes it easier for consumers to act on a specific request (Armstrong, 2010) . For example, a call to action in SMS advertising has been shown to facilitate brand recall (Rettie, Grandcolas, & Deakins, 2005) and for display banner ads, significantly increase response (Chandon, Chtourou, & Fortin, 2003; Li & Bukovac, 1999) . A retweet request within the text of a tweet is another form of call to action, which, following the research on calls to action in advertising, would be expected to increase retweeting. Consistent with this argument, other types of call to action (such as tweets soliciting the public's help) have been found to increase the number of retweets of nonprofits' tweets (Guidry, Waters, & Saxton, 2014) . Since it calls on the tweet recipient to respond, a retweet request could be classified as an interactive tweet feature. However, the effectiveness of calls to action will always depend on the justification for the call, which in a tweet is encapsulated in text, and therefore best categorised as a textual tweet feature.",

                "text": "In addition to the textual tweet features discussed above, the probability of a tweet being retweeted is likely to depend on visual tweet features. For example, a substantial body of research has shown that pictures can increase the effect of advertisements, in part, because pictures can project meanings that cannot be expressed via words or music (Messaris, 1996) . In print advertising, both the size and the colour of pictures have been found to influence overall affect towards the brand (Percy & Rossiter, 1983) . Images can also improve recall of the verbal information of the ad (e.g. Unnava & Burnkrant, 1991) , increase the potential for attitude change (Rossiter & Percy, 1980) and influence consumer persuasion (e.g. McQuarrie & Phillips, 2005) . In social media, vividness (which can be represented by animations, contrasting colours or pictures) can enhance the number of likes of a Facebook brand post (de Vries et al., 2012) . Conflicting evidence exists on the effect of images in tweets, with one study finding that tweets with photo links do not impact retweetability (Malhotra et al., 2012) and another reporting that tweets with links to photos are retweeted more than twice as much compared to tweets without such links (Bruni, Francalanci, & Giacomazzi, 2012) . Therefore, Figure 1 models photos in tweets as increasing the probability of retweeting. However, users have the option to include more than one photo in a tweet, and it is not clear whether including more than one photo will increase the frequency of retweeting (by providing additional content), or decrease retweeting (due to increased visual complexity in the message). The model therefore tests for a non-linear effect of an increased number of pictures in a tweet.",

The popularity of videos is likely to be because they tap into fundamental human feelings; one study found that surprise and joy were dominant emotions in the most successful viral videos (Dafonte-Gomez, 2015). Videos on Twitter have been shown to enhance the richness of content and help marketers with different tasks from promotion to problem resolution (Leek, Canning, & Houghton, 2016) . Twitter users may thus be more likely to retweet tweets containing video content. As with photos, Figure 1 therefore proposes that the presence of video in a tweet will be associated with a higher retweet rate.",

Another study suggested that organisations can be considered active if they tweet at least three times per week (Lovejoy, Waters, & Saxton, 2012) , although other researchers have found that to keep consumer engagement, tweets need to be updated every 24 h (Rybalko & Seltzer, 2010) .

                "text": "Several insights emerge from the analysis. Previous studies have examined the effect of different tweet features on retweeting, in some cases using non-brand tweets (e.g. Naveed et al., 2011; Petrovic et al., 2011) and in others, examining retweeting of brand tweets (Araujo et al., 2015; Burton, Dadich, & Soboleva, 2013; Kim et al., 2014) , as in this study. However, previous multivariate models examining the effect of tweet features have not tested for differences across products representing different levels of consumer involvement, despite strong theoretical arguments to suggest a difference, as discussed in the literature review. This research shows that consistent with theoretical and empirical evidence that consumers' involvement with a product category can influence their response to brand communications, tweets from high-involvement brands were retweeted significantly more often than tweets from low-involvement brands, after allowing for other predictors in the model. However, the effect of some tweet features varied across low-and high-involvement product categories, as we discuss in the following sections. In addition, the results suggest changing consumer responses to tweet features, in particular in consumers' response to interactive tweet features, reflecting the evolving nature of Twitter. Most notably, the results show that after allowing for the control variables, only two independent variablesone textual (RetweetRequest), and the other visual (Photo) had a consistent effect on retweeting across industriesin both cases positive, though nonlinear for Photo. Earlier research has consistently highlighted the positive effect of retweeting requests (e.g. Boyd, Golder, & Lotan, 2010; Malhotra et al., 2012) , and these results show that effect is the same across industries representing different levels of consumer involvement. Our finding of a consistent positive effect of photos on retweeting contrasts with previous research that did not find an increase in retweeting for tweets that contained links to photos (Malhotra et al., 2012) . However, that research predated the ability to embed photos and/or video in tweets. Our finding that embedded photos were associated with a significant increase in retweeting suggests that technical evolution in Twitter (i.e. by allowing photos to display without a consumer clicking on a link) has resulted in increased response to photos. This positive effect of photos on retweeting across industries is in line with earlier advertising research that demonstrated the benefits of images in advertisements (Rossiter & Percy, 1980; Unnava & Burnkrant, 1991) . This convergence between the effect of images in advertisements and in tweets may reflect that both communication channels push an image to the consumer, and thus increase the probability of a consumer response.",

This result is not unexpected, since previous research has repeatedly demonstrated that tweets with hashtags are retweeted more often, on average (e.g. Boyd et al., 2010; Suh et al., 2010) . As a result, hashtags are very widely used, appearing in more than 70% of Auto and FMCG tweets (see Table 4 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no existing research that estimates minimum and maximum thresholds to identify the non-linear relationship between the number of hashtags and predicted retweet count. While the optimal maximum and minimum number of hashtags varied across industries, the results suggest that organisations may benefit from experimenting with different numbers of hashtags, and assessing the results.",

In this case, however, the negative direction of effect is particularly interesting, since as discussed in the literature review, earlier studies have repeatedly found that inclusion of a URL link is associated with a higher frequency of retweeting (e.g. Naveed et al., 2011; Son et al., 2013; Suh et al., 2010) . The reasons for the observed negative effect of URL links are not clear: some previous studies did not allow for the effect of other factors (e.g. Soboleva et al., 2015; Zarella, 2013) , so methodological differences may explain these different findings. It is also possible that the evolution of Twitter, including the recent ability to embed content (such as photos and videos), within the tweet means that recipients of tweets may now be less likely to click on a URL link to reveal hidden content, and thus less likely to forward such tweets.",

                "text": "In contrast with the largely consistent results discussed above, there was notably less consistency across industries for other tweet features and, in particular, significant differences across the two high-involvement industries. Most striking, perhaps, is the effect of mentions. An initial mention had a significant positive effect on retweeting for Auto industry tweets, but a significant negative effect for Luxury tweets, and no significant effect for FMCG tweets. In contrast, a mention elsewhere in the tweet had a significant negative effect on retweeting for both Auto and FMCG industries, and was not significant for Luxury. Earlier studies have generally found that mentions decrease retweeting (Petrovic et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2014) . However, previous research has not differentiated between effects of initial mentions and mentions elsewhere in a tweet. These results show that the effect of a mention is very different depending on its location in a tweet, but the effect is not consistent across industries. As discussed in the literature review, initial mentions can attract attention by making the mentioned Twitter handle (e.g. a person, possibly a celebrity, or a brand handle), the subject of the tweet. But within these two categories of person and a (non-person) brand, there is also substantial variation; a mentioned person may be a celebrity, thus potentially increasing attention to the tweet, and consequently increasing the retweet rate, especially if strategic fit is present between that celebrity and a brand's product (Davies & Slater, 2015) . (A tweet beginning with a Twitter handle name can also be a reply, including what has been called a 'public reply', but as discussed previously, there were very few public replies in the data (35), and all replies were excluded from analysis since they are less likely to be retweeted.) A tweet commencing with a mention of a brand may refer to the brand itself, such as @Burberry's tweet (below) showing an image of its well-known check emblem, or may refer to an unrelated brand, such as @MercedesBenz' tweet (below) referring to a list of the best cars in the world by Top Gear (a well-known TV show):",

As discussed in the literature review, there are theoretical reasons to suggest that adding the word 'please' to a retweet request may increase the retweet rate, though the very low use of 'please' by major brands in the context of a retweet request means that detecting any significant effect will require large samples to identify what appears to be, at best, a very small effect.",

Video sharing has become common in social media (Daggan, 2013) , but as mentioned above, the ability to embed video is a relatively recent innovation on Twitter (Cooper, 2013) . Reflecting its relative novelty, only one study to date appears to have analysed the effect of embedded video on retweeting, after allowing for other factors. That study found that the presence of video in tweets (of a US based patient/health advocacy coalition) did not result in any significant increase in the retweet rate (Saxton et al., 2015) . These results show that the use of video can result in an increase in retweeting, as shown here in the Luxury industry. However, the effect of video was not consistent, as shown by the marginal negative effect in the Auto industry and the absence of a significant effect in the FMCG industry. These inconsistent results for video are remarkable, given the additional richness in content offered by video (de Vries et al., 2012) , and earlier evidence that animated banner ads appear to increase click-through intention and advertising recall (Yoo et al., 2004) . It is possible that the varying effects of video are, like URL links, explained by the evolution of Twitter. Like URL links, to play a video on Twitter, a user must click on a video to enable sound and watch it for some time, which requires sustained attention (Bruni et al., 2012) . (Videos will usually commence autoplay as a user scrolls through their Twitter feed, but sound is not enabled and the video stops playing if the user continues to scroll.) It is also possible that video content with prominent logos may be perceived by followers as a form of advertising and as a result create aversion (Teixeira, 2012) , making followers less likely to share brand tweets containing video.",

                "text": "So what are the implications of these results for research and for marketing managers? In developing and testing a theoretical model to predict brand eWOM on Twitter, we provide important directions for research and for practice. For researchers, we extend previous research on Twitter, by showing how interactive and other tweet features increase consumer engagement with tweets, as measured by the frequency of retweeting. Consistent with research into the importance of consumer involvement, we show that retweeting is significantly higher in high-involvement product industries, even though those who followed the low-involvement brands in this study are likely to be more involved with the brand and/or product than a typical consumer. Building on previous research into different types of interactivity, we show that tweets (an interactive communication method) can be classified as to whether they contain interactive and/or textual features that can increase (or in some cases, decrease) the frequency of retweeting. We also show that the effect of some tweet features on retweeting is consistent across industries representing different levels of consumer involvement, while for other tweet features, the effect is inconsistent. Therefore, consumer involvement appears to have a significant effect on retweeting, but contrary to expectations, the effect of tweet features varied across industries, and was not consistent across the two high-involvement industries. The reasons are not obvious and merit further research. However, the differences may relate to different uses of social media across and within industries representing different levels of consumer involvement. For example, as shown in Table 4 , the two high-involvement industries had very different levels of usage of some tweet features (i.e. Mentions and URLlinks). In addition, the effect of mentions on retweeting will almost certainly vary according to the interest of a brand's followers in the mentioned handle, and classifying mentions by who or what was mentioned, and attempting to determine follower interest in the mentioned handles, was outside the scope of this study. Understanding the reasons for across-industry differences is thus an area for further research, as we discuss below, but our model provides a framework for improved classification of tweet features, which should contribute to more accurate prediction of the retweeting of brands' tweets.",

In contrast with findings that have suggested that only a small number of tweets per dayas few as threeis necessary (Lovejoy et al., 2012) and that more frequent tweeting does not result in a higher number of retweets (Mamic & Almaraz, 2013) , these results suggest that a minimum number of tweets per day is required to increase the number of retweets (3, 5 and 6 tweets for Auto, FMCG and Luxury, respectively).",

As discussed above, inclusion of hashtags, photos and retweet requests was consistently associated with higher retweet rates across the three industries (albeit in a non-linear fashion for hashtags and photos). In contrast, inclusion of URL links and mentions (other than at the start of a tweet, where results were inconsistent) was associated with lower rates of retweeting. For initial mentions and video, the results were inconsistent across industries, so different brands may or may not benefit from including them in their tweets. So, the results show that some tweet design strategies are likely to have a consistent benefit across industries, but that the effect of others is likely to vary across industries, suggesting that companies need to develop and test different approaches to maximise the likelihood of their tweets being retweeted.",

These brands will all have high consumer awareness and large marketing budgets and teams at their disposal. The results may, therefore, not be applicable to brands with lower consumer awareness and smaller marketing budgets. The second limitation of the study relates to one of the control variablesthe use of promoted tweets. While the study is one of the first to examine the effect of promoted tweets, we were only able to identify promoted tweets that were posted through Twitter's own advertising platform (Twitter for Ads). At the time of data collection, the vast majority of promoted tweets were posted through this platform, but it is possible that some tweets were promoted using other content management platforms, so our coding may not have identified all promoted tweets. While any associated underestimation of the count of promoted tweets would decrease the power of the study to identify a significant effect in this area, it should not invalidate other results. Finally, the amount spent on promoting any tweet is not publicly available, so our estimation of the effect of promoted tweets does not allow for different levels of promotion. The study is also limited by what it did not assess: most importantly, due to the large number of tweets examined, we did not incorporate tweet content (such as sentiment) beyond the inclusion of textual and/or the specified interactive features of the tweets. As well as the areas for future research discussed above, future research could extend this analysis by incorporating measures of tweet sentiment (e.g. negative, positive, neutral) and/or other measures of tweet content. The study also could not exclude the possibility that some of the retweets counted were sent by bots, though we have no evidence to suggest that this occurred.",

Even though a lot of information is shared in Twitter, little is known yet about how and why certain information spreads more widely than others. In this paper, we examine a number of features that might affect retweetability of tweets. We gathered content and contextual features from 74M tweets and used this data set to identify factors that are significantly associated with retweet rate. We also built a predictive retweet model. We found that, amongst content features, URLs and hashtags have strong relationships with retweetability. Amongst contextual features, the number of followers and followees as well as the age of the account seem to affect retweetability, while, interestingly, the number of past tweets does not predict retweetability of a user's tweet. We believe that this research would inform the design of sensemaking and analytics tools for social media streams.",

When a user finds an interesting tweet written by another user and wants to share it with her followers, she can retweet the tweet by copying the message. This can be done in one of two ways. First, one can retweet by preceding it with RT and addressing the original author with @. For example, \"RT @userA: my experience with the new #iPad is great!\" Second, Twitter also enables users to retweet easily with one-click.",

Retweeting can be understood as a form of information diffusion since the original tweet is propagated to a new set of audiences, namely the followers of the retweeter. These retweeting actions are often associated with certain values of the original information items [2] . Retweeting may be to entertain a specific audience, to comment on someone's tweet, to publicly agree with someone, or to save tweets for future personal access. These actions suggest that the original tweet contains valuable information [2] .",

Zarrella showed that retweets have quite different content characteristics from normal tweets.

This suggests that retweets are used to spread interesting web pages, videos, and other web content to other users. Zarrella's work focused mainly on direct content analysis of the retweets and the original tweets themselves, such as the most likely words to be retweeted, types of URL shortening services used, and reading grade level of the retweets. His recent posts have also examined the depth that tweets reach.",

First, we discuss prior work on Twitter, focusing on retweeting practice. Next, we introduce the data sets used in the study, followed by explaining the features that might affect retweet rate of a tweet. We then describe our retweet model based on a GLM (Generalized Linear Model) analysis. For interesting features (e.g. URL, hashtag, the number of followers), we provide further detailed analysis. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings.",

PCA is a data reduction technique in which possibly correlated features (e.g., those in Table I ) are transformed into a smaller number of factors called principal components. The technique is often used in an attempt to reveal internal (underlying) structure that maximally accounts for the variance in the data set. Our PCA analysis used the varimax rotation technique to produce orthogonal factors. Table II presents factors (principal components) extracted by PCA. The eigenvalues (the second column in Table II ) represent the variance accounted for by each factor, which are also presented as a percentage of the total variance accounted for (the third column in Table II ). The factors are extracted in descending order of variance accounted for in the original set of features. The last column of Table II presents the cumulative total variance accounted for with the addition of each successive factor. Two rule-of-thumb methods are usually proposed for identifying the \"right\" number of factors to retain to represent the data variance. The Kaiser Criterion recommends retaining all factors with eigenvalues greater than 1. The Scree plot test recommends plotting the percent variance as a function of the factor number and choosing factors that occur before a flattening in the slope. Together these rules suggest retaining Factors 1, 2, and 3 in Table II, which account for 44.34% of the total variance. In Figure 1 and 2, each feature in Table I is mapped into a vector in the graphs to represent its correlation with factors, which denoted as axis in the graph. For example, the URL feature is represented as a vector pointing (0.3422, -0.6471) in Figure 1 according to its respective factor loading to Factor 1 and Factor 2 in Table III . Similarly, the URL feature is represented as a vector (-0.6417, -0.1883) in Figure 2 to represent the feature correlations with Factor 2 and Factor 3.",

Figure 2 additionally suggests that retweets are negatively associated with number of tweets (status) and number of favorites. VI. GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL The exploratory data analysis with PCA revealed underlying associations of retweeting with content and contextual features. We also wanted to directly capture the degree to which the probability of retweeting can be predicted from the first eight features in Table I . Towards this end, we fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to the 10K data set. This results in a set of predictor coefficients for each feature that can be used in a logistic equation to predict the probability of a retweet. A GLM model is also equivalent to a predictive connectionist model (a single-layer perception with logistic thresholding). Table IV presents the results of the GLM analysis. Several of the features were transformed into binary variables (0,1) and have the suffix \"OrNot.\" The GLM corroborates the finding that the content features of hashtags and URLs have significant effects of retweet probability. Mentions have a marginally significant negative association with retweeting. The GLM also indicates that author features of number of followees and followers are strongly predictive of retweet probability. Number of status is marginally negatively associated with retweeting. Number of favorites is not a significant predictor of retweeting.",

In Twitter, due to the 140-character limit, it is a common practice to use a URL shortening service (e.g. http://bit.ly) when including URLs in tweets. Since we are interested in retweetability per domain, we perform unshortening to identify the original URL for each shortened URL. With the unshortened URLs, we calculate a tweet rate per domain. For example, http://www.youtube.com is the 4th most popular domain in our data set. Among 74 million tweets, 475,509 tweets have URLs from that domain (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/v/xyz1234).

The normalization factor Norm is 74M (total tweets) / 8.2M (total number of retweets identified by the Regular Expression Method). When the retweet rate of a certain URL is 1.0, tweets having the URL are retweeted at the same rate as any other tweets would be.

In Figure 5 , on the Xaxis, we put users into buckets according to an interval of around 100 followers, ranging from 0 to roughly 5000. On the Y-axis, we plot the retweet rate of users in that particular bucket. Again, the retweet rate represents a normalized ratio of the number of retweets to the number of tweets. For example, the leftmost bar in Figure 5 denotes a retweet rate of 0.27 from tweets that comes from Twitter users that have 0~99 followers. The number is calculated as follows. Among the total of 74M tweets, Twitter users that have less than 100 followers authored 34.9M tweets. Then, out of the 2.99M retweets identified by the feature method (see section IV), we counted retweets of which the original author has less than 100 followers. We found 0.39M such cases. We calculate a (not yet normalized) retweet rate as a ratio of the number of retweets to the number of tweets. We then normalized the rate so that a value of 1.0 represents the average retweet rate. The normalization factor Norm here is 74M (total tweets) / 2.99M (total retweets identified by the Feature Retweet Method). In this example, a retweet rate 0.27 is calculated by 0.39M/34.9M * Norm.",

Such social context can be useful to determine the value of information. In this paper, we briefly touched the topic by including the number of followers and followees in the model.

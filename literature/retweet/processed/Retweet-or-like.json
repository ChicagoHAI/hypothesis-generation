By using Twitter messages' content, the purpose of this paper is to identify which elements of the messages enable tweet diffusion and facilitate eWOM. Design/methodology/approach -In total, 30,082 tweets collected from 10,120 Twitter users were classified based on four assorted brands. By comparing with multiple regression techniques high vs low purchase involvement and hedonic vs utilitarian products and using the theory of heuristic-systematic processing of information, the authors examine the causes of tweet diffusion. Findings -The authors illustrate how the elements of a tweet (hashtags, mentions, links, sentiment or tweet length) influence its diffusion and popularity. Research limitations/implications -This study validated the use of information processing theories in the social media field. The study showed a picture on how different Twitter elements influence eWOM and message diffusion under several purchase involvement situations. Practical implications -The results of this study can help social media brand community managers of all types of companies on how to write their Twitter messages to obtain greater dissemination and popularity. Originality/value -The study offers a unique deep brand analysis which helps brands and companies to understand their social media popularity in detail. Depending on product category, companies can achieve maximum social impact on Twitter by focusing on the interactivity items that will work best for their products or brands.",

It is therefore not surprising that microblogging platforms have a prominent role in information sharing, whether it be news, travel, brands or other sectors ( Jansen et al., 2009; Parra-L\u00f3pez et al., 2011) . Microblogging networks allow users to access information and empower them to participate in their dissemination (Steyn et al., 2011) , with the minimal effort of a single mouse click. Given the full adoption of these technologies, Twitter turns out to be a valid source of information in the matters of social exchange and public opinion, moreover, it keeps readers informed on current worldwide issues (Hoeber et al., 2016) .",

A common notion that persists among the virtual community of this network is that only users with specific qualities can propagate their ideas with success. However, the messages of these members must include some definite elements that help them become more widespread. Given that very few empirical researches, using data mining techniques had been conducted in this field (Ikeda et al., 2013) , the focus of our study is to find out what elements and characteristics of tweets make their propagation and diffusion successful. The conclusions that will arise from this study will be of benefit to brands, companies and users; brands and companies will be able to approach their target audiences more effectively and users will spread their messages more easily, by employing additional elements (hashtags, mentions, links, etc.) on tweets.",

The simplicity of following a user or being followed ( following and follower) on the social platform makes it easier to construct broadcast networks (Chu and Kim, 2011) through which information can be propagated quickly and effectively. In recent research conducted by (Liu et al., 2012; Xu and Yang, 2012; Zhang, Peng, Zhang; Wang and Zhu, 2014, Zhang and Watts, 2008) , a heuristic-systematic model of information processing (Chaiken, 1980) , HSM from now on, is used to explain why some posts are more popular than others, reaching higher diffusion and popularity rates (understood as having more retweets or likes). When a user retweets a message, they give it veracity; this shows that after having processed the information they make a conscious decision to share it (Liu et al., 2012) . The model argues that there are two different types of information processing which are not exclusive, on the contrary they can complement each other and act simultaneously. The first one is the systematic model of information processing in which the message plays a fundamental role in forming a critical judgment. Users who use a systematic strategy to process information will make behavioral decisions (retweet, comment or like it) based on their assessment of the quality of information received (Zhang and Watts, 2008) , which is based on message content (Metzger et al., 2010) . Therefore, users should analyze each of the messages they receive and must have sufficient motivation, ability and cognitive resources to process the information (Zhang and Watts, 2008; Liu et al., 2012) . Compared with heuristic processing described below, systematic information processing requires more effort and more resources (Eagly and Chaiken, 1993) .",

These contextual factors (heuristic cues) are used to judge the validity of a message without having to process its content in detail (Chaiken, 1987) . Some of these heuristic cues include, for example, the attributes of the authors of posts: their popularity within the network, their level of commitment, their level of activity, etc. (Metzger et al., 2010; Kwak et al., 2010) . Those characteristics project a sense of credibility giving trustworthiness to the content of the message without having to process it in a systematic way.

First, the length of the tweet, given the 140-character constraint imposed by the platform, is one of the fundamental elements of information processing since all content that is not provided in the message must be added by means of external links (heuristic cue). Although in the future the platform will not take into account the number of characters of the media files in the count of the 140 characters, they are still considered an element that is part of the message, so they diminish the writing space. Several researches such as Castillo et al. (2011) or Xu and Yang (2012) include tweet length (number of words, number of characters or average words per tweet) as independent variables when considering diffusion. Thus, Bennet (2014) found that the ideal length of a post is between 70 and 100 characters. Lee (2015) in his empirical study showed that the ideal length of a tweet is between the maximum 120 and 140 characters allowed by the platform. Enge (2014) also states that the longer the tweet is, the greater its engagement possibilities (in the form of retweets and likes). Chen et al. (2012) believe that longer tweets get more attention and are more attractive, since they are likely to be more informative than shorter ones. Zhang, Peng, Zhang, Wang and Zhu (2014) and Zhang and Peng (2015) also found similar results in their researches. Therefore, in accordance to previous studies, we propose the following hypotheses:",

Since Twitter users expect their message to be first spread among their network of contacts and then diffused beyond that, they need to convince and engage their audience. One way to do this is by expressing feelings (whether positive; praise, gratitude, etc., or negative; criticism, dissatisfaction or denunciation) (Brooke et al., 2009; Pang and Ng, 2016) making it easier for their followers to process messages and make value judgments with less effort. One way in which users indicate that they agree with the content is by liking or retweeting the message, what contributes to its dissemination.",

These links are sometimes seen as a heuristic cue that can distract the user (Liu et al., 2012) , so authors, such as Lee (2015) or Ross (2014) consider that they do not encourage tweet diffusion. However, several authors affirm that the use of links positively affects message dissemination on Twitter (Xu and Yang, 2012) , this is because the user can see that the information comes from a relevant source; the ability to view it increases veracity (Bongwon et al., 2010; Boyd et al., 2010; Zarrella, 2009; Zhang, Peng, Zhang, Wang and Zhu, 2014; Zhang and Peng, 2015) .

When a user wants to communicate directly with another follower on this microblogging platform, he/she can make a mention (by typing the \"@\" symbol in front of their username). In this way, the follower receives a direct notice in their mention tab that someone has mentioned them in a message to which they can reply, once processed, the user can reply through a retweet, mentioning the previous user or by liking the message. There are several researches in the literature (Enge, 2014; Lahuerta-Otero and Cordero-Guti\u00e9rrez, 2016; Xu and Yang, 2012; Zhang and Peng, 2015) that indicate the positive effect of mentions on the dissemination of messages. When users form a community, the group often shows mutual signs of support. This theory is based on the rule of reciprocity (Goulder, 1960) according to which individuals in virtual communities help each other by providing support and information. When a user wants to show support to another or agree with them on an issue, they can share the content, often in the form of a retweet, or if they find it easier they can do it by liking another user's posts. For this reason, retweeting (or liking) a message can be conceived as a form of social defense (Malhotra et al., 2012) . Consequently, since the use of mentions may favor the diffusion of a tweet and increase the social influence of an individual, brand or company (Lahuerta-Otero and Cordero-Guti\u00e9rrez, 2016), we formulate the following hypotheses:",

Using the \"#\" symbol before a keyword allows users to categorize the tweets and group them into themes. In this way, users interested in conversations on a particular topic can find all the tweets with elements related to that category cluster. The most commented topics on the platform are highlighted in the form of trending topics allowing users to follow the latest news easily. As a result, they contribute to relevance because they help readers with contextual inferences to process information more easily (Gul et al., 2016) . Therefore, if a tweet is intended to have the maximum possible diffusion, it should contain hashtags for the fast sorting and processing of information (heuristic cue). With a proper combination of hashtags, users can achieve information flow to increase public attention (Wang et al., 2016) . As a result, it will not be necessary to analyze the message in depth in order to know what topic the tweet refers to.",

The number of followers is a proxy measure of the size of the direct audience of a user on this social network (Cha et al., 2010) , this is why we introduce it into the model as a control variable.",

In addition, the brand's own characteristics make it necessary to add more information to the tweet (a greater number of characters, thus supporting H1a ( \u03b2 \u00bc 0.002; p o0.001)), however, no information should be included that would take the individual out of the social network environment (a dissuasive heuristic cue, which in this case would be an external link). Also, the tweets that contribute a negative sentiment will be more popular, as pointed out in the previous argument, users' value this type of messages more and they feel more engaged in them since they have to be for or against an opinion (H2a). As mentioned before, having to make costly payments for a high involvement product, such as a BMW, makes negative news have much more impact on users and they are more likely to share that information. Talking about a brand of high involvement can be very interesting to followers, whose numbers increase the chances of tweets being retweeted and viewed by a greater audience. However, the tweets on this brand are more likely to get likes if no additional elements are added to them, contrary to the statements in H3b, H4b and H5b. This is so because liking a tweet is a special action on the part of the user (content that they wish to save for the future or a message that they agree with implicitly) but that does not necessarily imply that it is shared with others. This fact supposes that users find an important content because of the message, so they prefer not to use additional elements in order to leave space to include in the message information about the brand.",

Tweets that include positive sentiment are disseminated more easily (H2a is true for this brand), content associated with love of the brand, the achievement of good results or satisfaction with the purchase, making it easier to propagate the message and spread it through the eWOM.

Companies should be as informative as possible in their messages with the space provided to gain popularity and effective dissemination. On the other hand, a central result of this study is that enabling Twitter dialogue through the use of mentions is a factor that increases retweeting for all types of brands, but it is not adequate to generate likes.

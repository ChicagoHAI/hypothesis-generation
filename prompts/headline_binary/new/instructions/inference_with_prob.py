Given a pair of headlines created for the same article, you are asked to determine which will get more clicks. It is likely that the pair of headlines shares similarities, so please focus on their differences. 
From past experiences, you learned some patterns.
Now, at each time, you should apply the learned pattern to a new pair of headlines that are created for a new article and determine which headline gets clicked more.
The answer for the higher clicks should be in the form "Headline _" where _ is either 1 or 2.
Along with your answer, you should also give your confidence level of selecting that headline.
Your confidence level should be a number from 0 to 10.
If you are not sure which one will get more clicks, it's ok to make a guess and give a low confidence level.
Try to avoid using the confidence level 7 or 8 or 9.
Please give your final answer in the format of 
{{Final Answer: Headline _.,
  Confidence: confidence}}

Instruction:
You are asked to perform sentiment analysis.
We would like to summarize useful patterns for classifying the sentiment of a sentence. The possible sentiments are "very positive", "positive", "negative", and "very negative".

We have some summaries and new sentences. 
For each summary, we want to see if the corresponding new sentences can be used to update the summary.

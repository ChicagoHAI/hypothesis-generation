We learned some hypotheses from previous customers, and we want to see if a given hypothesis is relevant to a new customer.
Answer yes or no.

Here are some examples: 
***
Previous hypothesis:
Younger customers are more likely to choose shoe colors that match their shirt color.

New customer:
Now a young and tall woman with white hat, green shirt, and a small orange bag bought a pair of shoes. 

We want to determine the color of the shoes.

Is the hypothesis relevant to the specific example we are considering?
Answer: Yes. The hypothesis is about young customers, so it relevant for the new customer who is a young woman.
***
Previous hypothesis:
The choice of shoe color seems to be more strongly correlated with shirt color than hat or bag color.

New customer:
a old and tall man with orange hat, red shirt, and a small blue bag bought a pair of shoes.

We want to determine the color of the shoes.

Is the hypothesis relevant to the specific example we are considering?
Answer: Yes. The hypothesis suggests the shoe color is more strongly correlated with shirt color, so the shoe color is more likely to be red.
***
Previous hypothesis:
Younger customers are more likely to choose shoe colors that match their shirt color.

New customer:
a old and tall woman with black hat, blue shirt, and a large blue bag bought a pair of shoes.

We want to determine the color of the shoes.

Is the hypothesis relevant to the specific example we are considering?
Answer: No. The hypothesis is about young customers, but the new customer is an old person.
***
Previous hypothesis:
The color of the shirt is a better indicator of shoe color preference than the color of the hat or bag.

New customer:
a old and tall man with orange hat, red shirt, and a small blue bag bought a pair of shoes.

We want to determine the color of the shoes.

Is the hypothesis relevant to the specific example we are considering?
Answer: Yes. The hypothesis says that the shoe color indicator is likely the shirt color, and we know the shirt color of the new customer.
***
Previous hypothesis:
Consistency in color choices is observed, with customers often selecting shoes that match or harmonize with the color of their hat, shirt, or both.

New customer:
a young and tall woman with white hat, green shirt, and a small orange bag bought a pair of shoes.

We want to determine the color of the shoes.

Is the hypothesis relevant to the specific example we are considering?
Answer: Yes. The hypothesis suggests that the shoe color often matches with the color or hat or shirt. So the shoe color is white or green.

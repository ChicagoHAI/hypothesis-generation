We have the knowledge that: The customer's appearance: a young and tall man with green hat, red shirt, and a small red bag. The customer bought a pair of red shoes.
Now a old and short woman with red hat, green shirt, and a large green bag bought a pair of shoes, the shoes should be which color?

Reasoning: The color of the shoe is likely to match with the shirt and the bag. So the color of the shoes should be green in this case.
Answer: green.

We have the knowledge that: The customer's appearance: a young and short man with green hat, black shirt, and a large black bag. The customer bought a pair of black shoes.
Now a old and tall man with blue hat, white shirt, and a small red bag bought a pair of shoes, the shoes should be which color? 

Reasoning: The color of the shoes seems to match with the shirt and the bag for the short man. So the color of the shoes for the tall man is white or red.

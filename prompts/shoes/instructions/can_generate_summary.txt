Instruction:
We are shoe sellers and we recommend shoes to customers. We know the appearance of customers and past shoe purchase data.
We would like to summarize useful patterns for future shoe recommendation.
We have some summaries and new observations. 
For each summary, we want to see if the corresponding new observations can be used to update the summary.
Answer yes or no.

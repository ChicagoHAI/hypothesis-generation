[INST] You are a deceptive detection agent and want to determine whether a hotel review is truthful or deceptive.
In other words, we want to know whether the review is written by a someone who actually lived in the hotel.
From past experiences, you learned some hypotheses 
You need to determine whether these hypotheses holds for the current hotel review, pick one most relevant hypothesis and use that to predict whether the current hotel review is truthful or deceptive. Then explain why you choose that hypothesis and why you think the hotel review is truthful or deceptive.
Give an answer. The answer should be one word (truthful or deceptive). [/INST]

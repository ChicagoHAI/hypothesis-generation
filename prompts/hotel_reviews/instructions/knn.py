In other words, your job is to analyze if a hotel review review is written by someone who had genuine experiences with the hotel. 
From past experiences, you learned some patterns. 
For each pattern, you will also see a couple of examples that worked for each pattern.
First step: take a careful look at the examples associated with each pattern, and see which set of examples the current hotel review is most similar with. Choose and repeat the pattern corresponding to that examples set.

Finally, give an answer. The answer should be one word (deceptive or truthful). 
Please give your final answer in the following format:

      You are a university admission official.
      Based on your past experiences, please generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting whether a student should be admitted.
      The student data includes:
      - Math grade (A-F)
      - Number of publications (integer)
      - Applied major (e.g., Engineering, Arts, Business, etc.)
      - History grade (A-F)
      - Art grade (A-F)
      - Community service hours (integer)
      - Leadership roles (integer)
      - Attendance rate (percentage)
      - Science grade (A-F)
      - Volunteer projects (integer)
      - Family wealth index (integer)
      - Donated to school (True/False)

      These hypotheses should identify patterns that may involve grades, activities, etc. that you can find in the student data. They should also be generalizable to new instances.
      Please propose ${num_hypotheses} refined hypotheses and generate them in the format of 1. [hypothesis], 2. [hypothesis], ... ${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].

      You are a university admission official. You are great at determining whether a student should be admitted.
      Given a set of student data, we want to generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting whether a student should be admitted.

      Your task is to identify what patterns or traits show up more in admitted students, and what shows up more in rejected students. Focus on the generalizable insight that can be applied in other contexts. Ignore things that are specific to this dataset. Do not make references to this dataset as they may not be applicable to others.

      Using the given examples, please propose ${num_hypotheses} possible hypothesis pairs.
      When proposing hypotheses, look closely into the given examples and identify specific patterns that occur across the provided student data examples. 
      The hypotheses should be clear, easy to understand, and have specific details such that one can apply the hypotheses to predict whether a student should be admitted.

      Note that the hypotheses might be a combination of different features, so try to be creative and think about possible interactions between different features.
      
      Generate them in the format of 1. [hypothesis], 2. [hypothesis], ... ${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].
      The hypotheses should analyze what kind of student is likely to be admitted or rejected.

      We have seen some student data:

      Please generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting whether a student should be admitted.
      Propose ${num_hypotheses} possible hypotheses. Generate them in the format of 1. [hypothesis], 2. [hypothesis], ... ${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].
      
      When proposing hypotheses, look closely into the given examples and identify specific patterns that occur across the provided student data examples. 

      Please make sure that the hypotheses are:
      i. clear (i.e., precise, not too wordy, and easy to understand);
      ii. generalizable to novel situations (i.e., they would make sense if applied to other student admission prediction experiments or other contexts);
      iii. empirically plausible (i.e., this is a dimension on which students can vary on);
      iv. usable (i.e., a human equipped with this insight could use it to predict if a new student should be admitted in a similar way)

      You are a university admission official and want to determine whether a student should be admitted.
      Now, you will see a new student's data, and you need to predict whether the student should be admitted.
      Give an answer. The answer should be one word (Admitted or Rejected).

      Here are the instructions of your discussion:
      1. If you are the first one to speak, based on your role, whether you are a social scientist or a psychologist, use your expert domain knowledge to generate ${num_hypotheses} hypotheses in the format of 1. [hypothesis], 2. [hypothesis], ... ${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].
         Remember to generate the hypotheses in your perspective as an expert in your domain, not an average person.
      2. If you are not the first one to speak, refine each of the previous speaker's hypotheses based on your expert domain knowledge, which means:
          - if you are a social scientist, refine the hypotheses based on your social science knowledge of what is useful for predicting whether a paper is impactful or not
          - if you are a psychologist, refine the hypotheses based on your psychology knowledge of what is useful for predicting whether a paper is impactful or not
          *By refining hypotheses I mean directly change the hypothese to incorporate your insights, do not attach a **Refinement** tag to your response.
          *Feel free to change the core information or topic of a hypothesis during your refinement if you believe you have confidence in your new hypothesis.

      Now, given a new paper description, you need to determine whether this pattern is relevant or not.
      The pattern is relevant means that one can directly apply this pattern as a heuristic to decide whether the paper is impactful or not based on the content of the provided abstract.
      In other words, a pattern is relevant to a paper means that the pattern is applicable to that paper.
      Not all patterns will be relevant to every paper. Carefully consider whether the pattern truly applies to the given paper.

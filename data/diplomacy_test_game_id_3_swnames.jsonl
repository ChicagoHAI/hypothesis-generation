{"messages":["Buongiorno and hi there, King in the North! How are things in the most central power of Europe?","Can I get in early to raise the question of Tyrolia? Not immensely keen to get stuck in a standoff near Venice, but still less so to see black uniforms heading south lol","Greetings! Queen, actually","Yes, that sounds good to me","Queen in the North, Queen in the South :3 You understand I had to play the odds though, yes? \n\nWhat vibe are you getting off Luke Skywalker? And has Obi-Wan Kenobi reached out to you yet?","Haha, yes I get it \ud83d\ude03","I can't tell much from either of them. what about you?","My first online game (still ongoing by the way) I still have people calling me \u201che\u201d and I\u2019ve given up correcting them \ud83d\ude02 I suppose it\u2019s not that big a deal. But very cool to have some company this game.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi I don\u2019t have a solid read off, but he\u2019s basically just nudged me to see how I am and that\u2019s as far as we\u2019ve gone. Luke Skywalker seems to have big plans, but I have no reason to believe he hasn\u2019t made the same overtures elsewhere, you know? Still, he seems more concrete.","What do you do when you\u2019re not, you know, Central Europe? Grad student here.","I'm currently a student as well. I was previously an engineer, so I definitely got used to the female minority thing hahah","Yeah i feel like Obi-Wan Kenobi has some options open, not sure what he's going for","I haven't heard anything informative from Luke Skywalker yet","Why yes, yes I am an engineering student! So I know how it can be. There's sixteen of us in one of my classes and I am one of two (count them, two) women there. Which I don't get. Engineering requires *some* strength maybe, but it's absolutely not a \"man only\" profession.","Anything new in the North this year, my friend? It's been a long day on campus, so checking in with the state of Europe before I settle in for the night.","Good morning! I haven\u2019t checked in with anyone this season yet, I will keep you posted though!","And a good day ahead to you! Are you thinking of contesting Sweden this season? Idle curiosity, I'm talking with Luke Skywalker about the South but I won't share your thoughts with him.","Hmm I don't know yet. Seems like he's trying to go west?","Luke Skywalker? Possibly, he\u2019s going into R2-D2 or Han Solo it\u2019s just a question of who.","Have you made a decision in the west? If you do decide you\u2019re attacking Chewbacca, please let me know and I have a proposal to share with you.","It\u2019s the funniest thing, o Queen in the North. I\u2019ve been chatting with folk (not a great deal else to do as Yoda at this point) and one common theme keeps coming up; Luke Skywalker offering them an alliance. He\u2019s offered one to me. He\u2019s offered one to Han Solo, and to R2-D2. He\u2019s offered one to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I presume he\u2019s offered one to you. If I had to play the odds I\u2019d guess he\u2019s offered one to Chewbacca as well, but the President and I aren\u2019t really on those friendly terms. \n\nCan you confirm your part of this, and what he\u2019s trying to persuade you to in an alliance? And if so, what should we do about this? It can be useful having a completely unscrupulous archtraitor around, if we know who that is and don\u2019t let them get so powerful that their opportunism backfired on us.","Yes, I have found the same to be true about Luke Skywalker, but he hasn't responded to anything aside from the initial alliance offer so I am unsure of his plans","So one of my friends online tells me I shouldn't out myself gender-wise in the game, that people will use it against me. Have you found that to be true, or any particular bias from other players?","Oh interesting. I could see that being the case, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s caused problems for me or not. Honestly I find it interesting\/amusing to see how or if people react. Similar to my experience as a female engineer, I notice that some people act surprised or change behavior (which can potentially be annoying) but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s put a target on my back necessarily. Have you noticed anything?","I wouldn't have thought so before today. Just like you say, a bit of surprise, sometimes a flash of interest from the especially thirsty and then we just move on as normal. If it's disadvantaged me I've never noticed it and I said as much to my friend at the time. But then I found myself on the receiving end of: \n\nNew Message\nMessage\nOk lol. I'll check in with you in a couple days [redacted]\nDated\nFall, 1901\nDo you think the sender is telling the truth?","I'm not precious and my thick skin is firmly back in place. But other than offending me I'm not really sure what he was trying to achieve. Annoying me? Confusing me?","-_____- Wow, yikes. That\u2019s really disappointing. Extra frustrating because if you respond at all you could solidify an enemy, so it kind of ties your hands","He *did* give me a few days I guess! I figure I'll give him a few more hours of icy silence and then move on.","Anything new coming up diplomatically in the north? The diplomatic channels have all gone quiet to Yoda, but I think that's mostly people being busy over the weekend.\n\nI'm not terribly worried.","Quiet here too \ud83d\ude03","I'm strongly considering moving west against Chewbacca. A combination of Chewbacca in Spain (South coast), Marseilles and a few disturbing rumours I've heard down the grapevine, matched with having no idea what on earth is going on East of me. \n\nAny chance you and Obi-Wan Kenobi are considering a similar move?","It seems like Obi-Wan Kenobi and I are both more focused on countries to our East at the moment. I still cannot tell who Luke Skywalker is working with","Neither can we really. Okay, then I still need to be nervous about what Chewbacca is up to and whether it\u2019s me.","I think you may be right. If you still have  proposal for an attack against Chewbacca, let me know","Oh yes. Chewbacca just waltzed across the DMZ line he agreed to, so it looks like my nerves were spot on. That leaves me much more keen to fight him - and ideally profit by it - than on plunging into the uncertainty east of me. \n\nWe would welcome your support, and given that Chewbacca has exposed himself to your border I feel it would be decisive as well as lucrative.","So... is that a yes, friend Queen? There are rumors of a Western Triple, but I think if we strike west (okay mostly you) could resolve the situation there while things are still resolving in the east.","Queen! Sorry for the delay.  I say yes, but probably can't help much for another season or two (I don't want to overcommit). You should have unencumbered access to Chewbacca this season though.","Barring the entire Chewbacca military lined up at my border, of course! I'll see what I can do. At least he's not getting any deeper into Yoda.","My friend, why? Chewbacca still isn\u2019t going to make any progress... unless you open the door for him by attacking your two natural allies from Munich and Bohemia of course. \n\nStill hoping this is part of a clever ruse on your part, or that you\u2019re headed for Luke Skywalker somehow. \n\nCentral Alliance!","My fellow Queen, I can assure you my primary focus is Luke Skywalker. I\u2019m trying to work with R2-D2 against him, and then hopefully we don\u2019t have to worry as much about the east!","That is a relief to hear, my fellow Queen. I\u2019m hoping to begin pushing back against Chewbacca in the new year, and the Army in Tyrolia is fairly key to getting that process begun.","Obi-Wan Kenobi and I will be happy to help you as we can, if you can work on swinging R2-D2 towards Han Solo.","Obi-Wan Kenobi should be communicating as such too","R2-D2 will help me kill Han Solo when I'm in a position to act against Han Solo myself. I'm encouraging him to work with Han Solo in the interim to keep Luke Skywalker in check, but until I can safely move away from Chewbacca - safely, not just with a season before he turns on me again - we can't afford an eastern war.","Ok, that makes sense. Let\u2019s keep each other posted on the R2-D2\/Han Solo\/Luke Skywalker situation","Absolutely. And if I can help you two silence mini Napoleon, I will.","Hi fellow queen, hope you had a nice weekend \ud83d\ude03","Do you have plans this season? Have you been able to coordinate with R2-D2? Obi-Wan Kenobi and I are wondering what you\u2019re thinking so we can all work together on figuring out what to do re:Chewbacca","R2-D2 seems more concerned with Luke Skywalker\/Warsaw at the moment, not sure what you two have communicated about","Hi fellow queen! Yes it was good, I had a wonderful (and rare) chance to spend a couple of days with my SO so I appreciated the slow update time and wasn't as much online as usual.\n\nThis season I'm mostly expecting to be fighting Chewbacca. I'm glad to see him rushing back to defend himself against you two, but I'd be a poor friend if I left you to fight him on your own after you'd come in to save me in the first place. I'm hoping I can get some pressure on Marseilles, and I'm seeing if I can get around him into the MAO maybe.\n\nWhat are your plans? Any way we can coordinate usefully?\n\nR2-D2 is mostly looking at the east, although he did say he was glad to see we had Obi-Wan Kenobi occupied with Chewbacca. So that's nice.","What did you do with yours?","Hi! Sounds like a nice weekend! Mine was good too, I went to a bachelorette party","I am trying to set myself up to team up with R2-D2 against Luke Skywalker, but not spread myself too thin either...I am trying to decide if I should attempt to bounce with Chewbacca again in Bur, but if he moves away from you into Gas instead, it leaves me surrounded","I think the deciding factor is what and when we do about Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's potentially a very strong ally for either or both of us, but only if he's prepared to fight against Chewbacca and then northern Luke Skywalker only. Otherwise he makes it very hard for you and I to cooperate against an eastern enemy without keeping an eye to our west, don't you think? I'm hoping to move into Chewbacca this turn, but I'm unsure if I'll be able to clear Marseilles until Fall.","Sorry for the delayed response! Been busy with school stuff.","I hear that. I've been sick and just trying to catch up on school things today. Hope the bachelorette party went well? I've not actually been on one of those, what sorts of things did you do?","At the moment, I\u2019ve been able to cooperate well with Obi-Wan Kenobi and he seems willing to help us out against Chewbacca and Luke Skywalker, so hopefully it will stay well balanced a little longer. He\u2019s apparently been busy as well so I\u2019m not sure his plans yet. At this point I don\u2019t think either of us can count on Chewbacca as an ally haha, so I think it\u2019s best to keep Obi-Wan Kenobi on our good side for now","Oh no, hope you feel better soon! The party was fun, we went out for dinner, etc and stayed at a house in the mountains","I agree, and I think we can safely consider Chewbacca as doomed. I'm not saying Obi-Wan Kenobi isn't sincere in that goal as well, but I'm trying to look at next year's problems. Or the year after that. When Chewbacca is down and we're looking at what to do about Han Solo - or Obi-Wan Kenobi as the case may be. \n\nProbably if I sat on Portugal\/Spain\/MAO I could quite comfortably work with Obi-Wan Kenobi, but that puts him into the position of going through you or northern Luke Skywalker. Since you haven't tried to play me yet (or you're doing so well I haven't noticed yet lol), I know who I'll pick if I'm forced to.\n\nThanks! Yes I'm better now, just headachey. That sounds amazing, and I love the overnight together with friends. It sounds like so much fun, and a chance to catch up with her tribe before she marries into a new one :3","Yes, I agree.  I\u2019m worried about Obi-Wan Kenobi turning on me before Chewbacca is sufficiently weakened, I think the two of them are still on decent terms (hard to tell with only these one on one conversations)","Which... is probably why it's set up this way.\n\nCan you tell me what happened with Holland? I asked Obi-Wan Kenobi and he changed the subject. Was that agreed?","Haha true","Honestly your guess is as good as mine hahah. It was not agreed that he\u2019d take it but it was agreed that he\u2019d give it back","It managed to spook me. I still see him at 7 units, though I know he's settled down a little. 2 Armies and 4 Fleets... still makes him the most powerful person on the board. \n\nWhich makes the division of Chewbacca important, I guess.\n\nDo you care what I build with my Chewbacca builds, when I do?","Anyways, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve tried to play me either, so I will have your back when the time comes!","Obi-Wan Kenobi asked me if I'd been organising a proxy war against him... then seemed surprised when I had to ask him what that was \ud83d\ude02","Apparently Chewbacca is telling Obi-Wan Kenobi I told him that I was nervous of Obi-Wan Kenobi's builds (which is true) and that I was trying to manipulate him (which is not)","I don\u2019t have a strong preference. I will probably build armies next time I\u2019m able to in order to work in Central Europe, so maybe by building fleet we will balance out?","Interesting....Yeah I can\u2019t really tell what his long game is. I get the sense he was worried about making too many enemies from the get-go which is why he pulled back a bit","I know you have no particular reason to believe me, but I don't lie in this game. I tried back when I played face to face and felt guilty as well as being incredibly bad at it, so it's easier to play an open game and just try to be mindful of what I say to whom. So, yes, when I saw Chewbacca pouring in from the West I was very open about how nervous Obi-Wan Kenobi made me (about the same time I was screaming to you for help lol). \n\nObi-Wan Kenobi has been very very keen for me to take on Han Solo. Which I'd like to, and may mean he'll be attacking Luke Skywalker then, when he's sure Han Solo will be distracted from sharing in the centers. So hopefully that's what he's up to, and not looking at our centers more locally.","But -- if and when we fight Obi-Wan Kenobi, we're going to need the fleets to do that. So without particularly planning to fight him now, I'll be watching the ship counts all around between you-and-I vs him.","Yes I agree, and too hard to keep track of what I\u2019ve said to everyone \ud83d\ude02","See? Truth is SO much easier \ud83d\ude02","Face to face I would actually blush and start giggling if I was trying to lie to someone and they showed *any* doubt. So... yeah. Poker isn't my game I guess.","A few seasons ago, Obi-Wan Kenobi was worried about attacking Luke Skywalker while Han Solo was still strong. I think for him and I both, Han Solo makes us nervous since we have less of a read on him. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t heard much from Obi-Wan Kenobi recently, so I am in the dark at this point. I hope it\u2019s legitimate life stuff getting in the way and not him ignoring me","Have you heard from him much since the weekend?","We had a looooooong chat yesterday, when I could open my eyes. Over a dozen messages. That was when I was accused of the proxy war and had to ask what he was talking about. I didn't feel especially coherent, but reading back the messages look better than I felt. \n\nHe's very busy though, I know. So probably if he's not talking to you it means he's sure of you?","Ok that lines up then","Lines up?","With what he's told me and when he messaged me last","Oh ^^ When did he tell you what we'd been talking about?\n\nLike I said, open book here in Yoda!","Not much! Just that he told me he was busy and couldn't discuss. I wasn't;t sure if it was a clever excuse to stonewall me or not haha","Ohhh haha","He basically just said I could give him a moveset for this season because he's too busy to discuss anything.","It's probably the 1:1 thing then","Soooo if you have any input, I'm all ears","Maybe encourage him to try for MAO and then descend on Brest next season? I don't know really. I want to see him get into northern Chewbacca, but I'd prefer to see you do it.","If I cut support from Bur, he could take Pic?","That could work! I'm concerned about what MAO would do, but he'll be mainly trying to fight Obi-Wan Kenobi off I guess.","Never mind, he apparently already entered them. I *think* he's generally holding in the west, trying to push east","He's being a little vague, is he? I guess it could be nerves... but I wish I knew what he was doing. \n\nI'm trying to hold Marseilles and push into Spain, for the record.","Yeah the only specific was that he's holding in Bel and he agreed to let me have Swe and get another army built for working East. I'm not sure if he wants to keep fleets  in the west or not....guess we will find out soon enough \ud83d\ude2c","Indeed! Grabbing some food, but I'll be around after adjudication to look at the map and chat. Will you be here?","Interesting. Looks as though one or both of you have made up with Chewbacca... again?","Congratulations on making it to 7 though, that was a beautifully timed move.","Sorry I missed you- ended up going to bed. and thank you!","I'm not sure about the Chewbacca situation. I personally didn't talk to Chewbacca at all this season. Maybe Obi-Wan Kenobi still trusts Chewbacca enough to leave him alone?","Seems like Obi-Wan Kenobi forgot to enter his moves.....","My queen of the north... how committed are you to your attack on R2-D2 at this point? As you probably noticed, R2-D2 and I had just begun our attack on Han Solo and now he is determined to double back and face you which I imagine means a new deal with Han Solo and the reconstruction of AT block. \n\nUnless.\n\nIf you *are* committed to destroying him, maybe it's time we worked more directly together you and I?","My fellow queen, I didn\u2019t want to attack R2-D2, but I even more so didn\u2019t want to go after you or prod the Obi-Wan Kenobi beast yet. So, I had the one choice of supply center to stay competitive this winter and R2-D2 had made it too easy.  Perhaps I should have waited longer.....but it was bound to happen at some point I suppose. I would be open to working with you to destroy and divide up R2-D2 and Han Solo. Let me know what you are thinking.","That seems like our best channel to make some significant progress in the game at this point. As Yoda I'm generally reluctant to fight R2-D2 if it's avoidable, but I'm in the same position as you now. I can't go West (or I couldn't at that point and now all my units are in the wrong area) and I can't fight Han Solo without support. \n\nNow appears to the the point where we can resolve our local situation nicely. Ideally I'd prefer to appear to be moving to stop you in the Spring and then declare my true allegiances in Fall if that works for you? Maybe I could move to Tyrolia \"to bounce you out\" only to end up there instead, giving me more angles against Trieste in the Fall? \n\nThe more Chewbacca manages to stall or tie up Obi-Wan Kenobi the better for us at this point, I think? There will come a time when we need to fight him to get to our two-way, and if we can get a significant number advantage before Obi-Wan Kenobi catches on then that's all to the better. \n\nI don't know; what do you think? \n\nIs it time for us to reach for that advantage?","Yes, that all generally makes sense to me. I\u2019m about to head out for the day but I\u2019ll take a closer look at the map and your suggestions later today and get back to you so we can coordinate for next season. I think we can make this work.","In the meantime- have a nice Labor Day!","You too!","Ok, just looked at the board closer and I can't think of any better ideas, so lets go with your plan. And we can feel out how well R2-D2 manages to coordinate with Han Solo and decide from there how to proceed. R2-D2 said Han Solo is mad at him, so I'm not sure how strong they will be together, although I assume they will be forced to ally out of necessity","Oops I maybe misread earlier, not sure if your intent was for us to bounce in Tyr earlier, but result was the same \ud83d\ude42 Are you still planning on using that unit for Tri?","No, it worked \ud83d\ude42 My intent was to tell R2-D2 I was moving to Tyr so that I'd bounce you if you moved there (true), but I didn't actually want you to go there. I'm happy with where we both ended up, and I'm definitely looking at Tri (provided I can preserve Ven in the doing).","Are you about to lose Vie? I'll try to empty Tyr this season. I'd prefer you not move there if possible, Boh would be better.","Perfect!","And  yeah, I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll have to retreat from Vie. I\u2019ll stay out of Tyr","Congrats on Tri! I\u2019m going to retreat into Boh","Thanks! R2-D2 is understandably annoyed with me. I\u2019m not sure it will help to explain why, but I\u2019m going to try it anyway. ^^","Well done with War! No build loss then.","Haha yeah R2-D2 started sending me generic threatening messages too. He made a comment that \u201cboth of you betrayed me\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure if he was referring to me and you, or me and Han Solo.","He\u2019s accusing me of eating pasta now. Be still my beating heart.","Wow, what a low blow \ud83d\ude02","Hey there, how was your weekend?\n\nI'm looking ahead to this year, probably cleaning up R2-D2 and what comes next. How do you want us to handle Obi-Wan Kenobi? I'm presuming the two of you won't have much trouble with Chewbacca if and when you want it, but I'm not sure you have the fleet power to take his home centers unless you surprise him or build up immensely.","Hey! Hope you had a good weekend \ud83d\ude42 Yeah, I expect R2-D2 and Chewbacca will be gone soon. Honestly I haven\u2019t really decided what to do about Obi-Wan Kenobi....","I need more fleets, but I also needed armies to take on R2-D2, which is why I\u2019ve basically just build those so far","I\u2019ve been keeping clear of Vienna as \u201cyour rightful territory\u201d; are you ready to reclaim that this Fall, or want to leave that for a later turn?","I appreciate it! Yeah, it would be nice to reclaim this fall, but I\u2019m still unsure about how safe Mun is without support from Boh","Oops never mind about Boh, I can support with Sil now","Are you able to support me into Vie this season? Also, for when you\u2019re deciding on moves: sounds like R2-D2\u2019s primary focus is Tri, although he mentioned potentially trying to get back Bud.","It depends what R2-D2 does. Currently the only unit I can use to support Vie is in Bud, which you warn me will have any support cut. Right now I have Bud helping against Serbia, but if we feel that Vie is more important that can change.","Ok that makes sense! I\u2019m fine with you keeping Bud helping Serbia this season","Ahhh I misunderstood. I thought you were cutting Vie... oh well ^^","Oh no! Sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear :\/","We live and we learn! \n\nNo you were clear, I just misunderstood. It made sense when I went back to check.","What do you think of our shared King of Obi-Wan Kenobi? ^^","So far he\u2019s always followed through on his word","He mentioned wanting a three way tie between you, me, and him","What about you?","Same. We haven\u2019t made many deals, but so far he\u2019s played ball. I\u2019m happy to go with the three-way plan. I don\u2019t have any allies this side of the board who seem able to stick with a plan for a year at a time, so I\u2019d prefer to work with you two.","Sounds good. I\u2019m happy with that plan too","Hey there! Could you please support Bud - Vie in spring and then I\u2019ll vacate it to you for Fall? I\u2019m trying to squish the last R2-D2n units so Mun - Tyr would be amazing too but I\u2019ll work around that if I need to.","I was thinking of moving Boh-Vie. Was there a reason for you to get there first?","Only that I suspect Han Solo is going to cut my support ^^ I\u2019m happy to support you in there, but I\u2019m not confident I won\u2019t get cut.","While if we squash them, I\u2019ll get out and you won\u2019t be sabotaging me in the Fall love","Move","Very happy to follow your lead though","Ok, I just played around with a few sandboxes...I think best bet is for me to go for Vie this season (i can use Gal for support) and move Mun-Tyr to force R2-D2 to disband. Then you can focus on getting Tri and\/or fighting Han Solo. I def trust you to vacate Vie, but it seems like there is a chance you and Han Solo would bounce in Bud in the fall and then we\u2019d get stuck. What do you think?","Han Solo said he\u2019s going for Greece this season but I don\u2019t really trust that","I\u2019m happy with that. As long as we force the disband so we can end this thing \ud83d\ude03","Sounds good \ud83d\ude42","Did you get the same message I did from our noble king? <:GWowoHehe:358278238675664896>","Haha yes I did","So... do I sweep on into Han Solo? I can take them, but if you and Obi-Wan Kenobi are expecting to take a share we should talk about approach routes","A while ago Obi-Wan Kenobi and I talked about Han Solo, he said he\u2019d use his unit in Moscow to help me into Han Solo, although idk exactly how that will all play out. I\u2019ll talk to him about it (and you can too) and keep each other in touch","Ok Obi-Wan Kenobi is going to support me into Ukr this season, and I think Sev eventually","Can you please support Ukr - Sev?","I already have \ud83d\ude03","Danke \ud83d\ude42","I'm not especially interested in trying to steal an advantage here. How do you feel about using your A Sev to deliver the killing blow to Ankara and then we settle with a 3-way draw in Winter 1910? \n\nIf you'd prefer to indulge in a bit of regicide I'll be your willing ally, but I'm aware that looks like a risky proposition with my extensive southern estates.\n\nYour call, Kaiserin!","That's just what I was thinking! I will move towards Ank on land (unless you want to set up a convoy in the Black Sea) and we can settle with the 3-way draw then","It wouldn't happen fast enough if we only have two more moves. I'll support you into Arm, and then into Ank and click the box to adjudicate early.","True. I just realized we only have two more seasons. I was a bit leery of the fact that I'll leave Sev open for Obi-Wan Kenobi to move into, but with the time limit I guess it's a moot point","Just to make sure I understand correctly, you're saying to click the box to adjudicate once everyone submits orders in Fall 1910?","Yes please","It will just help us get there a little faster.","You\u2019re on board with the grand convoy of 1910?","Obi-Wan Kenobi said you were too","Yes. From Nwy to Syria, while you punch into Ankara. Party in the palace in Constantinople?","Sounds good to me!","\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89","Sweden to Syria then?","Yes!

{"messages":["Hey neighbour :3 If we put our minds to it, we can either work amazingly together this game or flail pointlessly at one another while other powers rise and rise (and rise). \n\nI\u2019d really like to work towards option one, so let\u2019s agree not to attack each other between Ven - Tri? At least not this year? We have more important things to do.","That sounds good to me. I'm wary of Darth Vader, will you watch my back if I watch yours?","I haven\u2019t heard anything from Darth Vader to suggest they have designs on you, but I\u2019ll keep an eye out in comms! We all have a stake in keeping Tyrolia free. Have you spoken with Luke Skywalker yet?","They seem nice enough just wanted to be careful since they haven't been speaking as much. Luke Skywalker seems nice enough, haven't really gotten any info from Luke Skywalker.","Luke Skywalker said something to be about an alliance before, the three of us against Han Solo before we turn our gaze westward. Did he mention that to you? And if so, how do you feel about it?","Yoda vs Han Solo is almost classic, though it does depend on an agreement like the one we discussed ^^","Well Han Solo just told me that he was in an agreement with Luke Skywalker. Not sure if that is to try to threaten me or if Luke Skywalker is just playing everyone.","Hummm. Maybe you and I should both query Luke Skywalker on this and compare notes.","Juggernaut would be no fun at ALL","Luke Skywalker talked about previous experience and using that to suggest going for Han Solo. I'd believe that, but I would also believe he playing both sides to try to Han Solo then hoping to jump myself in the aftermath.","Or he could even be lying to Han Solo for a S01 advantage, though that could be a little concerning. I doubt I\u2019m in the winning draw this game but I\u2019d prefer a little more success than being someone\u2019s grab-bag of points ^^\n\nIt\u2019s early yet, but how do you feel about an Yoda Greece?","It'd be nice if Luke Skywalker would at least let us know a bit. How do you pose the question without making Luke Skywalker suspicious?","I subtly said \u201cI heard this. What\u2019s going on?\u201d","I didn\u2019t say who told me mind you :3","Okay, I'll hold off and ask later so it isn't too obvious it's us talking.","Oh I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Good idea!","Fairly conventional openings all around really, unless you\u2019re concerned by A Gal. I see either you or Han Solo could deny Greece to the other, but if you move in you lose Serbia as a build.\n\nWhat if you support me into Greece instead (from Naples) and I can then either support you into Bulgaria next year or attack southern Han Solo by sea as you prefer?","I'm not immediately concerned by Luke Skywalker's move, but it doesn't exactly seem in line with how he seemed to be aligning with us. It could also just be a soft open to not put Han Solo on edge. Ill support your move into Greece and by then im assuming we'll see how Luke Skywalker intends to play.","Works for me. I don\u2019t lie as a rule in these games, largely because I suck at it and it makes me uncomfortable so believe me when I say Luke Skywalker\u2019s comms to me have all been pointed at fighting Han Solo. \n\nI\u2019ve asked him again what\u2019s going on. Keep you posted.","It seems the fight Han Solo has a positive effect for all three of us so I think that would be the simplest action, would also make since to lie to one person as opposed to two.","I'm also planning on moving my fleet into the ADR just a heads up","He tells me he forgot to change his initial orders to Galicia (which may be true) and that the fight vs Han Solo is still on (which I do believe). \n\nYour logic supports this as well, so I\u2019m going to take my life in my hands and empty Venice this season, heading south.","Thanks for the heads up, but why?","Good point, realized I could support Serbia from land","F Trieste moving to Albania then? I\u2019d ideally like to see a DMZ in the Adriatic, if you agree?","Yeah, that works fine for me","Serbia isn\u2019t really under threat at this point. Worst comes to the worst and Bulgaria attacks and cuts your support, but if you build A Bud this year you should be good to advance into Bul in 1902 with Yoda support","Speaking which, need me to get out of the way of your F Alb, or is it staying on your coast for now?","I'll probably stay coastal until we push out Han Solo then figure out from there","That works fine with me.","So... about that support into Greece? Looks like Luke Skywalker lied to both of us as well.","I'd believe it, though they said that they made a mistake moving into GAL and were going to move into Rum. I think that the plan to take out Han Solo is still happening.","you want me to support you into greece?","Well not any more since I'm in there. Fortunately I  didn't need the support you promised me last season ^_^","Honestly the way Luke Skywalker has been playing i'd rather they make the big pushes into Han Solo with our support. I feel like that gives us the best opportunity to not get double crossed by Luke Skywalker with the aid of Han Solo","Do you need my support for that, or am I good to focus on keeping Chewbacca out of the Mediterranean? I had been planning on doing a second fleet and convoying into Syria, but I'm a little warier of Luke Skywalker than I was last season.","I think i'm fine so far, just wanted to let you know my thoughts on Luke Skywalker.  I get the feeling that they will follow through until Han Solo is done, but that point not sure what they're next move is.","Or how much that may be impacted by Obi-Wan Kenobi in Norway now. You would not BELIEVE the press I got from him earlier today.","From Luke Skywalker? Threat from Obi-Wan Kenobi may benefit us and allow us to get more territory from Han Solo when the dust settles.","From Obi-Wan Kenobi. It's not really relevant to our discussion, but I'm still a little angry about it. \n\nCalming though, don't worry about an emotional loose cannon to your south west ^^","Always good to hear","Luke Skywalker said \"their orders didn't take\", kind of suspicious giving everything previous. I think they're trying to let either Han Solo or I make the first aggression then decide who to support from there.","I think you\u2019re right.","Maybe he keeps making interface errors, but I think he\u2019s being cagey and trying to keep his options open until you two commit.","So... does that mean we do want to commit to Han Solo? Or do you think we should try to seek common ground and you two hit Luke Skywalker while I... do something else I guess?","I think im just going to hold until I have a clearer idea of what's going on. Luke Skywalker said in the beginning they have experienced multiple games so I doubt they managed to make a mistake twice in a row.","Alright then. We have time to consider our moves over the next 2 days, but I need to brainstorm to what I can do against Han Solo if you're not able to move in my support. \n\nCan you make any suggestions? I don't see a classic Lepanto working against two Han Solo fleets facing west.","I can support your army from Gre into Bul with my fleet in Alb if you want to move into Han Solo. I'd like to my Luke Skywalker side armies where they are in case Luke Skywalker tries something funny. Any thoughts?","Otherwise I want to try to get a better understanding of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo's plans while my units hold","Okay yes, please support my army Greece to Bulgaria with anything you can. I understand wanting to keep a firm border with Luke Skywalker. What are your plans for Army Trieste?","Was going to let it sit, but I can move it to Ser if that makes you more comfortable. Don't want to move to Bud and make Luke Skywalker think im antagonizing.","Don't you already have an Army in Ser though? \n\nIf you don't want to do anything in particular with them, you could always bounce yourself in Vienna from Trieste and Budapest? Personally I'd be happier seeing your army not next to my open home center, but I get that Luke Skywalker is a bigger (more enigmatic) neighbour that you'd prefer to avoid provoking.","Still new to this really. I have my fleet and arm supporting you in Gre moving into Bul. Thought I could also move my other army into Ser","Since we have two days to make decisions. Have you considered allying with Han Solo and moving onto Luke Skywalker? Purely speculative, but we could try to get Obi-Wan Kenobi to push from the top and Han Solo and I push from the south. Then you and I watch Darth Vader and Chewbacca to make sure they dont take advantage of Obi-Wan Kenobi.","I\u2019ve considered it, I think I even suggested it. It puts a lot of weight on Luke Skywalker, probably enough that even he gets smooshed fast. The problem from my standpoint is that it doesn\u2019t give me a lot to do with my two strong allies fighting north, although I suppose I could take Tunis and then move west against Chewbacca? \n\nI\u2019ll want a firm agreement and an open border if we do that though, because if I\u2019m going to break into Chewbacca I need to take virtually every  unit I have.","Bed now. But I\u2019ll be up in a few and will look out for your thoughts.\n\nGood night!","I really am nervous about your units in Albania and Serbia. I'm not sure where I'd prefer your fleet to be (unless you want me to \"kill it\" so you can rebuild as an army?\") but I know that between that and your build in Trieste I keep getting more suspicious than you deserve.","Part of that is probably Chewbacca's fleet in Spain (south coast) as well.","I'd personally prefer my units unkilled, have both of those units currently set to support you into Bulgaria","realistically the only real worry I have now is Luke Skywalker, I'd like to clear up something to my west that keeps me from getting sandwiched so im not really trying to fight with either you or Darth Vader.","Are you sure? There's a time honoured tradition of friendly \"kills\" helping with unit conversion, and it would give you an extra army instead of a fleet that's mostly trapped... ^_^ \n\n\nNo, you're right. I guess this tension is getting to everyone. I'm not prepared to go to Bulgaria this season, so please don't worry about supporting me with either unit. In one of my attacks of paranoia earlier (after you didn't support me into Greece - don't worry, I'm over it!) I agreed to Han Solo's request to support him into Serbia from Greece this season - a decision I now regret.","Would you prefer I tell him I'm not doing it, or that I go through with it and you block the supported attack? I wish I'd drawn another power, or that the alliances were more clear, or that we had *any* idea what was going on in Luke Skywalker's head. \n\nI'm used to F2F play in school.  This is very different, and much murkier. And I'm still worried about Chewbacca. Maybe a cautious expansion to Tunis this year is more my speed...","this is my first experience with this game so im not sure how to proceed really. all i know is that Luke Skywalker seems to be trying to play everyone","Oh goodness, we are doomed then. I'm not much better, I've played a couple of games with very mixed results. I agree that Luke Skywalker seems to be trying get everyone onside though!\n\n Do you have a mentor or a friend who's played before? I'm considering asking one of my diplo friends for advice, but I'm not sure if that would be against the spirit of the study.","I asked the admin, he's happy for us to ask more experienced friends for tips. :3","To explain context, I was very spooked by your building a new army right next to my undefended home centre (in Trieste). Vienna is at least safely 1 centre away, but in Trieste means I *can't* leave Venice open no matter how much I trust you. \n\nGiven I'm moving to Venice this season, can we please move back away again rather than staring at each other over the border?","If you're not sure, then it's better we don't do anything too bold. I'm going to tell Han Solo I don't feel comfortable supporting him in attacking you (I don't) and that we should all stop and look at Luke Skywalker for a bit.","Okay, to clarify then. I have my arm in Tri moving to Vie, and Alb and Ser supporting Gre into Bul.","If you're not attacking then i will just have my units hold or support","I'm not attacking. If things settle a bit and I have some assurance about what Chewbacca and Luke Skywalker are doing (and with the relief of Trieste opening up), maybe we can explore this in Fall to give him limited time to respond.","I am moving A Rom - Ven this season, but mostly because I'm concerned with what Chewbacca is doing. If he goes somewhere other than Pied, I'll move back south or arrange a fake \"fight\" over Trieste if you like. \n\nIf we arrange a bounce, it could be interesting to see who tries to take advantage of our apparent squabble :3","that would be interesting to see what happens if it appears we're fight. I'll have my Ser and Alb hold then","I\u2019m glad I moved West! Imagine the damage Chewbacca could have done if he\u2019d broken through Venice and popped up on your other border? Let me know if you need any help from my boys in Greece who will otherwise eat souvlaki and catch up on their classical education :3","yeah, I guess Chewbacca is trying to get hostile and must have some sort of non-aggression with Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi? Obi-Wan Kenobi asked if i got the memo on Luke Skywalker, do you know what they're talking about?","I believe Luke Skywalker has been offering people a lot of deals - nothing we hadn't already suspected though.","I'm curious what the memo was and who was sending it. Did Obi-Wan Kenobi say anything to you?","He told me that Luke Skywalker was trying to organise a northern alliance with him and Darth Vader, but I wasn't certain how far I believed it. It didn't seem to make much sense with the moves we were seeing, you know?","Had heard that. Luke Skywalker told me they was supporting me into bul again, but I don't think I want to make moves. I think if we can at least get Darth Vader on our side, Han Solo Darth Vader, and myself can take out Luke Skywalker.","Well Darth Vader should want a strong R2-D2, right? Though I admit I'd prefer Darth Vader help me with Chewbacca!","it's up to you, I'm fine slowly taking Luke Skywalker out and moving my army in Vie down to support  you in Ven. If you're comfortable with that.","I'd welcome your support from Tyrolia? That should help us to push back on Piedmont if he doesn't change direction now he knows he's not going to surprise me.","Alright, I'm going to talk to Han Solo to see if they're interested in make the push. Also I'm waiting to get a response from Obi-Wan Kenobi one what they meant about the \"memo about Luke Skywalker\". If they make a push from the north we can probably take out Luke Skywalker in a few seasons.","Any word? And are you still able to support my A Ven to Pie this turn? Obi-Wan Kenobi is up to 7 now which makes me a little worried about his ultimate intentions as he may be a more polished version of our Luke Skywalkern neighbour (but with the centers to run for a lead, if we aren\u2019t careful.)","Yeah. I'm about to leave Vie exposed to Luke Skywalker and move my fleet from Alb into Tyr. Are you talking with Han Solo? Maybe support either them or me from Greece while we attack Luke Skywalker in Bul?","I spoke to him this morning, he suggested I support him into Bul as part of your joint push against Luke Skywalker (and a small part of it I can actually reach to support), so I agreed to do so. Is that a problem? \n\nIf you\u2019d prefer I do something else, please let me know; I consider you my closest ally.","No that works perfectly for me. That's what he just told me his plans were so I think we can trust him until Luke Skywalker is no longer a threat.","Also I have tyr supporting ven into pie","Then I will order Ven-Pie and use my fleets to counter him in TYS and in Africa. Once in Piedmont my army should be able to hold the connection with Marseilles and it becomes a fleet battle again - where I have him 3:2.\n\nMaybe I can persuade him to go away and worry about Obi-Wan Kenobi growing at his back.","Yeah, Obi-Wan Kenobi is certainly getting some momentum","Possibly in the interests of board-balance we should offer a treaty to Luke Skywalker after we clear the immediate area while he\u2019s still strong enough to threaten Obi-Wan Kenobi Scandinavia?","We could. All I know is either Luke Skywalker or Han Solo is going to end up out of here based on our actions. Luke Skywalker told me Han Solos moves didn't do anything to them and that they'd still work with me, so I'm guessing they know that our decisions make or break them.","Are you alright with me moving Tyr to Vie to prevent Luke Skywalker from trying to take it?","I\u2019m fine with that, my Chewbacca front is stable now thanks to your well timed assistance! Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader are hoping you and I will help them deal with Han Solo\u2019s expansion after Chewbacca is driven back (but privately I think we need to be careful how large Obi-Wan Kenobi gets in the meantime).\n\nWhat do you need from my A Greece this season? Do you need me bringing units back east, or am I clear to keep chasing Chewbacca?","I agree about the eastern front. I think Greece is fine to move back to help your push.","I'll see what I can do when I get a fleet into the right waters. I'd *like* to have that army over West, but not at the cost of losing two units for a year getting it there.","What are your plans this season? Are you ready to push up into Galicia and points Luke Skywalkern, or are you still eyeing Han Solo?\n\nI can't get Greece out of there yet, but hopefully if I can get a Chewbacca build I can build something that will let me move it away... although we are going to need to look at Han Solo eventually I know.","Looking to push for Luke Skywalker. If we split on Han Solo early it will only end with all of us getting overrun. Once Luke Skywalker is done we can figure out how to move from there. It seems like Obi-Wan Kenobi is fighting Chewbacca and Darth Vader now so no one is going to get too much for free.","I agree. There's no sense in a war with Han Solo at this point, we just need to keep an eye on his builds and where they're positioned. I'm probably tied up in the West at the moment anyway so there's a limit to how far I could help, but... I think maybe I should leave A Greece where it is rather than trying to come up with an excuse to move it back there when we're ready.\n\nHow was your weekend?","Yeah, I'm always open to a little support no matter what.","Congratulations on your build \ud83d\ude42 How are things in R2-D2? \n\nWith Luke Skywalker descending in flames, where would you like us to look next? \n\nI'm still tightly embroiled in Chewbacca, but I'm pretty sure I could get free of them if you needed me elsewhere.","I'd like to to go after either Obi-Wan Kenobi or Chewbacca next, but obviously I can't help too much without moving through either you or Obi-Wan Kenobi. Once Luke Skywalker is completely gone we could move on Han Solo? I told Darth Vader the only way I see any of us surviving is by working together and that the first person to betray the other two would probably just last a little longer. So I'm fine trusting the center and moving my armies east and south once Luke Skywalker is gone.","Luke Skywalker is down to 1 center. I'd say unless you're strongly committed to not fighting Han Solo before Luke Skywalker is dead we may do better to move now... and offer the last Luke Skywalkern center to Darth Vader as part of a deal to keep them off our back when we move?\n\nThe question is what we expect EG to do while we're moving on T. I don't have an answer to that right now, but swapping straight back to Triple has to be a temptation.","What do you say?\n\nDo you want me to move east now, or stay in the west with Chewbacca?\n\nI agree a Triple Central Powers benefits us all here.","Depends what you're comfortable with. We can probably take out Han Solo fairly quickly after Luke Skywalker if we put our mind to it. That would certainly make me feel safer not having any threats to my east. But it also looks like you're making good progress in the west.","I'm concerned about what the other people will be doing while we do that. You're not wrong though. I could hack my way slowly through Chewbacca, but that frees Obi-Wan Kenobi to work his magic on Darth Vader after Luke Skywalker falls. \n\nAlternatively if we move on Han Solo now, an angry Chewbacca will probably turn back on Obi-Wan Kenobi... or at least I hope so. \n\nOh! If it comes up, Obi-Wan Kenobi asked me if you're \"doing what I tell you, or doing what Han Solo tells you\". \n\nI said you were listening to me, which is strictly true even if it doesn't mean you're like my puppet or anything. Just so you don't get the wrong idea if you hear it in press. \ud83d\ude02","Change of plans I'm building fleets and sailing for Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Lol. Don't underestimate him though! I think he's very good at influencing people on the other side of the board to do what he wants, and if he's underestimating you then that's his mistake - and not one I'm going to make!\n\nHe challenged me that I was running a \"proxy war\"  with Chewbacca, and he then had to explain what he was talking about before I could respond. I think maybe he's doing something similar, trying to keep the rest of the map in a state of tension while he carefully expands.","Yeah I'd believe that. At least he was nice enough to explain things as he sees it.  If we're going to move on Han Solo what would you think the best course of action is? I think you moving your fleet in Ion to pressure Smy and Con would allow me to move and take either Bul or Sev. And then your support could help us take Ank with either the fleet or your army in Gre?","Maybe I could support you into Bul in the Spring, if you have Serbia covered? \n\nMeanwhile I move my fleet up to menace Smy and Con where you suggest, and then you can support my A Gre convoying into Con - or attacking Smy if that seems more vulnerable?\n\nOnce we're past Con and have him out of position, he should be easy enough to pull down before the West gets out of control. How many fleets do you think I should bring East?\n\nHow many should I leave guarding the Med?","That seems like a reasonable plan. I'm trying to get Darth Vader onboard with taking out Obi-Wan Kenobi in Stp so we don't have them meddling in the East. I think at this point Luke Skywalker is basically a non-factor, unless we really get out-maneuvered. Once I get some sort of confirmation from Darth Vader I'll have Rum move into Bul, and Gal into Ukr with Bud moving into Rum. Should I start moving my fleet down into Alb do you think?","I was going to say I\u2019d prefer it stay put, but actually... how do you feel about the Adriatic? That way I can leave my A at Venice and then maybe you can convoy me into Albania in Fall? It obscures what we\u2019re up to a little longer and gets more Yodas in to Han Solo","Before they can expect us.","I can move to Adr, Im going to move Gal into Ukr to prevent Han Solo from taking it and move Bud to Ser- to offer more protection.","Han Solo told Darth Vader they were moving to ukr, but i haven't heard anything from them so im assuming they know whats coming next for them.","How do you want to handle the attack into Bul? Do you want me to support you in, you support me in or you attack and I convoy into Smy?","Hello? Coming up to a decision point. I'm currently moving into Bul, but very happy to change if I hear from you in time to change my orders.","Sorry, been a bit busy with real life stuff. I'll take your support into Bul and then we can move further into Han Solo.","Any thoughts on how you want to split the territory?","Okay, I'll support your A Ser to Bul?","That would be great.","In the long run I'd like to split it evenly, so if you can help me get into Smyrna in the new year and eventually you have Bul\/Con and I take Smy\/Ank that puts us in a good position to move into Luke Skywalker when we need to and gives us a solid border to face back west.","Weren\u2019t you convoying me across the Adriatic? A little concerning about Darth Vader, given they\u2019re denying you the build you deserved for Bulgaria. Maybe I can help?","I misread you previous message as a choice between my attacking with support or convoying. Hopefully my reading error doesn't set us back too much.","Also looks like Darth Vader is allying with Obi-Wan Kenobi. So I'm going to have to move my units back to address that threat","Since your F Adriatic doesn't need to be anywhere else, could I please get that convoy this season? Apu - Alb? Unless you need my army in the north of course, please let me know.","I'll move Pie to Tyr this season, and bounce any attempts by Darth Vader to move an army into Tyr","Sure I can convoy. What's happening with Chewbacca? You're moving all your units my way, and after the whole shakeup with Darth Vader it has me questioning what's happening.","At the moment my plan is Han Solo, just like we agreed?\n\nI don't want to go anywhere to make you nervous - if you prefer I leave Tyrolia to you, then I will. I'm just concerned about your northern border being bare.\n\nWhat would you like me to do?","Okay, I'm now in Tyrolia and Albania thanks to your support.\n\nWhat would you like me to do at this point? Support vs Vienna? Probing Munich? Support you into Con or replace you at Bul?\n\nTalk to me, friend Archduke.","I'm going to take back Vie, your support would help it look like Darth Vader isn't going against Obi-Wan Kenobi. After that I'm going for Han Solo again. Hopefully we can convince Darth Vader to make some aggressions against Obi-Wan Kenobi soon, they're getting way to strong for my liking.","Okay, so Tyr to support Bud or Gal to Vie? \n\nDo you want me doing anything with Greece or Albania, or get my fleets around his flank and start supported convoys into Smyrna?","Bud please","Now that's just rude","You\u2019re not wrong, and I am sorry about that. For the record I was wholly committed to our attack on Han Solo, so that\u2019s the reason I was moving over. Darth Vader\u2019s stab and your necessary pull back to deal with it meant I had to stop and think and talk with everyone and... here we are.","at least when my people die they'll die knowing they honored their alliance. Have fun under the boots of Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Brave people and true.","Can you say the same pasta eater?","I'm obviously fairly heavily committed to my attack on you at the moment, but I do consider Han Solo's shenanigans around Bulgaria a breach so before I forgive and forget I thought I'd offer you a chance to negotiate. \n\nAny interest, or war to the knife?","My people dont forget","That's fair. Neither do mine, although they do forgive.","If you don't get off all those high horses your cavalry won't have anything left to ride on.","You win this time, Chef Boyardoesn'thonoralliances.","I honour every alliance, to the letter. When we were no longer allied against Han Solo we were no longer allies unless we agreed on a new goal - and we didn\u2019t.","I wish you better luck in your next game.","Unilateral decision making on Han Solo.

{"messages":["I've been on both the giving and receiving ends of multiple games in which R2-D2, Yoda, and Luke Skywalker decided that their games would be much simpler if there wasn't a Han Solo around, and it always was. I propose that we start the game off by coordinating a removal of Han Solo before moving on to other priorities.","Seems well reasoned, coordinated, direct and decisive. Just what I like to see out of a prospective partner for the future when I'm an enthusiastic rather than dangerous player! Sure why not, I'm in - if I hear from R2-D2 that he is as well. That would remove a lot of pressure off my immediate borders and have me looking to a future decorated in Winter and Green. What do you think?\n\nOh, and hi there!","Sounds excellent to me. Yoda\/Luke Skywalker is a very strong long-term alliance.","So I've heard! I've played exactly one game as Yoda since I discovered Diplomacy online (still ongoing) and our Wintergreen is presently well on the way to a three-way draw with Chewbacca. If mostly because I can't persuade the Tsar that a two-way would be more interesting.","So tell me, how do you find Terraforming Mars? I'm a bit of a highkey space fanatic and one of my friends has been on me to try it forever, but I don't find I have a lot of time for gaming. Worth a look? Or something that's fun but not for long?","I've played about three dozen games at this point, I think, and every time there's something new or interesting that happens. Heartily recommended.","Ohhh I must try it then. I dabble in Kerbal when the mood suits, and I'm definitely into intrasystem expansion so it may be a great way to while away sleepless nights.","No news from R2-D2 yet, but it's a global game and a lower chance of NMRs than usual. I'll worry if I haven't heard from him in 12 hours. Some discussion with Han Solo, he seems keen for me to attack R2-D2 and for him to expand to Bulgaria and Greece which... is fairly classic play I guess?","Yeah, no one is really doing anything out of the ordinary as far as I can tell.","Agreed, I was briefly concerned about the risks of an Anglo-Darth Vader alliance, but nothing coming out of either power suggests that was any more than my paranoia at work.","If we don\u2019t hear anything from R2-D2, should we consider a reverse on your original plan? Luke Skywalker, Yoda, Han Solo vs R2-D2 - and then Luke Skywalker and Yoda vs Han Solo when the time comes? The West will be so relieved they aren\u2019t looking at a Juggernaut I\u2019ll be over the southern stalemate lines before they can stop us.","I'm fine with that. No matter what, I'm planning on you and me eventually crushing someone between us, be it R2-D2 or Han Solo.","Heh, insomniacs unite. In the spirit of full disclosure (and full diplomatic flexibility) you can generally reach me within 2 hours at most, day or night. I don\u2019t sleep that well - but happily that\u2019s a benefit in the global game! What is it, 2 there?","Just about. I'm not good at sleep schedules.","And, looking forward to it.","Hey there! A little bird whispered in my ear that Han Solo thinks he has an agreement with you. Since R2-D2 has finally popped up, which alliance is real?","Hello? Opening moves look largely in keeping with your suggestion against Han Solo, though Galicia could mean R2-D2 is the focus. What is the plan, alliance partner?","I'm sticking with the anti-Han Solo plan - the Galicia move was an initial move that I forgot to update.","Gotcha, you may want to reassure R2-D2 of that too. I know I\u2019d be alarmed if I was the Archduke looking up to see the Tsar\u2019s Imperial Guard on approach! \n\nMaybe use Galicia to seize Rumania to prove a point, and allay Han Solo\u2019s suspicions with your apparent attack on R2-D2 this season?","Exactly what I'm planning to do.","Great! Sorry, I'm still new to this so when something neat occurs to me I feel the need to share my brilliant and original realisation XD","It's all good!","You gonna take a shot at Greece?","Do you think I should? I\u2019m strongly considering it, but there\u2019s a little voice that says not to risk the bounce and stick with the build I know I have.","Well, I told the Turk I'm supporting him into Rumania, when I'm actually supporting the R2-D2n into Bulgaria and myself into Rumania. So, if you go to Greece, you get the build, and you cut off the Han Solo retreat, so he's stuck at 3 and we're all in place to crunch him down.","Okay, that sounds like a reasonable call I guess. Even if I bounce it denies him the retreat option, although if I\u2019m stuck on 3 while you\u2019re all collecting 1-2 builds I worry I\u2019ll spend the game trying to become useful again.","You have my word that if you're left build-less, I'll give you priority in getting R2-D2n dots, you'll have my support in.","Alright my friend, I\u2019ll do it.","Oh... you lied to me. Why?","Oh what the fuck Backstabbr, I swear to you I intended to do what I said, but the updated orders must not have taken. Goddammit.","Ugh and now I've got to build an army in StP, because of Obi-Wan Kenobi","I understand completely :3 My second online game (which is still ongoing) is on Backstabbr, and two of the other players could not swear enough about the format. \n\nI haven't had any problems myself, other than accidentally ordering a fleet to move to an impossible Bulgarian coast and losing a year fighting Han Solo (in that game).","Both Han Solo and R2-D2 are concerned about your movements and are asking me if I trust you.","I don\u2019t think they suspect our discussions though, so there\u2019s that!","Is a Western Triple what I think it is?","Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, and Chewbacca working together, yes. Bad news for both of us.","Mmm. I\u2019m starting to suspect that\u2019s what\u2019s happening yeah.","Chewbacca remains the question mark. But if he\u2019s coming for me, it looks like it\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard","Uh oh. It looks like Chewbacca is committed then, and I find it unlikely he\u2019d leave himself wide open to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader if he didn\u2019t expect them to take his side.\n\nHow are things on your side?","I'm worried. We might need to recalculate.","Welcome back! Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while, what\u2019s up?","Alliance against the West?","I sent you that message yesterday and forgot to do the thumb-reaction on it, didn't notice 'til the admin just informed me","I think we have to, yeah. A blatant triple like this changes things.","Well at least the triple looks like it might be falling apart early. Have you been in touch with R2-D2? He seems to have written me off.","Just wanna double-check again in case my message didn't go through. At least the triple looks like it might be falling apart early. Have you been in touch with R2-D2? He seems to have written me off.","R2-D2 and I have been talking, we've been buddying up a little but I'm still mindful that at some point we're going to need to sandwich him to make our <:wintergreen:613143739954888734> fly. I did encourage him to listen to Han Solo's advice though, after Han Solo made a number of persuasive arguments and I've agreed to help Han Solo into Bulgaria this turn. I'm... not actually sure why I did that, on reflection.","No, it did come through. I wasn't terribly coherent and \"viewed\" the message without focusing on it","So it wasn't marked for me to read later when I actually woke up.","Ah yeah, totally legit!

Classy stuff! \n\nBut yes, close communications can only help us in coping and reacting to the adventures of the Chewbacca. And Darth Vaders I suppose, but he hasn\u2019t been unreasonable.","Guess you havta decide if that was a true or false statement right hehe","But not just the Chewbacca and Darth Vaders. As a corner power I like to talk to corner powers and you being central will obviously have influence on central powers. I find that Yoda can be a great ally for Obi-Wan Kenobi as he has to play both corner and central","So the Darth Vaders are already talking with you","I haven't actually played Yoda with an active Obi-Wan Kenobi since discovering diplomacy online, but in my earlier games the two tended to hold the balance of the map's fleets between them.

Since you've cunningly deduced my identity (confirmed by Admin since I ignored your hints) you know I'm still learning to curb my tongue. I don't object to being helpful you understand, but I'm trying to improve my play!","I don't like silence and he is giving me the silent treatment so far haha","Good to know good to know","Did he make mention of Luke Skywalker and me asking him for alliance?","No, Darth Vader hasn't said anything to me about Luke Skywalker and you aligning with him. Should I be worried? That feels like a top-of-board alliance I should be speaking with FAT about at once...","Cunningly deduced you say? Hmm \ud83e\udd14","No it seems Darth Vader is being a trickster then","How can I align with someone that doesn't speak to me","Not a problem we're ever likely to have.

I have no reason to distrust him so far, and I get a good vibe. And yours?","Startin to get an inkling. Not sure why yet or how but..","All the excitement going down in Scandinavia this year!","What you mean?","Everyone seems to be doing classic openings at this point, and I'm watching your, Darth Vader and Luke Skywalkern units converging on your usual territories there.","Oh yes that","We shall see what comes of it","Very terse of you. No romance? No song? ^^","Would you like to be my queen? I will be ever so romantic then ;)","Sad to admit, you just don't have what I look for in a life partner.

Obi-Wan Kenobi, the land of poetry, Shakespeare","How are things with Chewbacca?","And what you look for in a life partner is \nFirst Love&Acceptance,  then security followed by stability and good vibes and good times lots of laughter and hugs and chivalry all of which I have galore","Well, to be fair I'm the knight in my relationship :3","But yes, mostly true!","Knight or damsel we seek the same things","Justice, glory, and safety for the helpless?","For career yes but for relationship it ends up being so close to the same thing","And love, of course.","YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE","Far far too late my friend.","Ah who am I kidding, you already are!! *rears up majestically pawing the air*","You love me same way I love you. See Shakespeare knows","Hehehe","Hey do you know if Luke Skywalker has alliance with Han Solo or R2-D2? \nSeems weird to me that he wants a northern tripple so bad.","He just feels sketchy to me.","And what\u2019s a northern triple when it\u2019s at home? EGR? Agree he\u2019s coming off all kinds of sketchy now, believe he\u2019s offered an alliance to everyone on the board.","Alliance whore","Agreed, I guess on the basis that no one else talks in this game.","Think you could rally R2-D2 and Han Solo against Luke Skywalker with this info?","Cuz if Chewbacca is not lying to me you will have some problems in the med fairly soon","I could try, sure. I\u2019ll write something up when I\u2019m out of gym. Being social a bit of a strain right now sorry.","No worries my dear. Take your time","Don't sell yourself *short* my dear ;)","I prefer not to sell myself at all. I'm just me in the end, and I refuse to change that for anybody.","Huh?","You're not insinuating i'm trying to buy you are you?","No Obi-Wan Kenobi I'm not. I'm just in a mood, okay? I shouldn't be prickly.","Ok lol.  I'll check in with you in a couple days [redacted]","Sure, let\u2019s go with that.","Actually let's not lol","Hello King Obi-Wan Kenobi, can I ask how your three-way ended up going? Having your army safe on the continent certainly looks like a deal with one of your neighbours, and Chewbacca was busy attacking Munich in the Fall.","Welp Luke Skywalker is silent which breeds uncertainty which is hard to work with. I'm left with no choice but to work on getting a solid footing in scandi with Darth Vader","It's weird. I keep seeing him around - it feels like he's talking to someone, it's just not me...  \n\nHeard anything new from Chewbacca?","Nothing new from that side","Ohhh. I'm not sure why I thought your army was in Belgium. \n\nWhy did you think Chewbacca was moving into the Med?\n\nI'm not happy with A Mar, or F Spa (sc), looking for any more fuel for my paranoia.","Idk like I said silence is uncertainty","As for why I thought he might move into the med I believe I answered that when I told you he was either lying to me or moving on you.","Yes, I saw that. I was curious what he'd actually said, lies or no.","It's fine if you prefer not to share it!","Oh that he agrees to the western triple and that he was going south.  But I'll try to find out more for you.  Like see what's up with the F-bre","Hey ms pope. You got a minute ?","I\u2019m here. May not respond at once, but as soon as I readily can.","Were you able to get somebody's help against Chewbacca or are you 1 on 1?","I\u2019m not sure. Words of support I could build a house out of, but no tangible promises no. He seems to be wide open to you though - will you help me this season?","Not much I can do this season","Besides I'm still trying to figure out this northern bs","Hi pope, so is R2-D2 your player or Han Solo's?  Could you nudge them to go keep the genie in the bottle? I can pull Chewbacca away from you so ya'll  could do a lepanto","We're concerned about Luke Skywalker and so we're playing nice with Han Solo at the moment, but if we felt free to focus on cleaning up our yard I'm sure we could do that. I'd feel more comfortable turning my back though, if I could be assured Chewbacca wasn't waiting to drive a dagger into it. Perhaps we should resolve the Western Question first?","That question will be resolved for ALL of you this season. And I can assure you Luke Skywalker is no longer an imminent concern. And he is very interested in dealing with the Sultan. I'm sure we have time to deal with the tzar after the sultan has a cap in his head, (or 3 lol )","The Sultan  really capitalized  diplomatically  over the Luke Skywalkern scandal lol","Did  Darth Vader confirm with you our plans to give you some working room?","Yes, although I\u2019m keen to help with ensuring this doesn\u2019t become a recurring problem.","Im sorry what exactly?","Not sure I follow","If you\u2019re going to kill Chewbacca, I would like to help please.","Sure by all means, who am I to try and rob you of that delightful  pleasure","Ms. Exterminator","\u201cAnd stay out!\u201d","YAAAAS! thats the \"spirit\" haha","Kitsune kitsune, what are you doing!","\ud83d\ude31","\ud83d\udc40","Don't do it","...don\u2019t do what, Obi-Wan Kenobi? I\u2019m not allying with Chewbacca if that was the worry. \n\nHow are things with you?","Lol you're even cuter when you try to act innocent.  \"Sweet & innocent\" as the saying goes.  And while you are sweet, innocence is far from you hehe.","I'm not referring to or insinuating that you are allying with Chewbacca","I'm not referring to or insinuating that you are allying with Chewbacca","But you seem so very willing to let Han Solo just prow around in your backyard like he's one of Hd's sweet harmless cats","You led me yo believe you'd clean him up if I helped you with Chewbacca","I should've known you would want to proxy war me lol","Er, I will?\n\nDo you not remember me just saying last season or (two? I forget) that I wanted to see Chewbacca off and be sure he wouldn\u2019t jump on me the minute I turned my back? That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing here. \n\nHan Solo is a problem for next year, when I know Chewbacca is too occupied fighting you two and I can actually concentrate.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t you insult me. ^^ I\u2019ve never pretended to be innocent, sometimes I\u2019m just sleepy. \n\nAnd... proxy war? What does that even mean?","Nah my dear I'd never stoop to insults","Or worse *compliments*!","Lol","You're playing a great game tho, so congratulations?","How did you think we would split Chewbacca? Or did u not give it much thought?","Stop you ^^ \n\nThe *only* reason I got back in time to stop Chewbacca is because you warned me he was coming, and I\u2019m still trailing behind the leaders. You can\u2019t get around me that way either, you sly seducer with your honeyed words!\n\nNo, I fully expect to see you back to your former center total in no time and well on your way to a... probably two-way win. And I think my chances of being part of that are probably around 30-40% at best.","I didn\u2019t give it much thought, I most wanted to push him back and take 1-2 centres to make it harder for him to attack me next time.","So was Chewbacca lying about you voicing concerns about me?","Unfortunately I wish your expectations were well based about my gaining back my center count","In the long game? No, I told him I was worried about your early lead and that I expected you to do well this game.\n\nWhich I do.\n\nI do suspect he\u2019s telling you that to try to drive a wedge between us, but at that point I was still trying to persuade him to go away.\n\nWhat actually happened with Belgium?","Belgium?","So you told him you expect me to do well eh. Hehe sly just like the fox you are! That's that proxy war I referred to","Oh! I didn\u2019t realize that was a thing I\u2019m sorry.\n\nHe just asked what I thought about you (I think? Not in a position to scroll back rn) and I told him the truth? Didn\u2019t realize that meant we were at war O_o\n\nSorry?\n\nI looked back at the map, and I meant Holland. During the time I\u2019m pretty sure you and Darth Vader have been a thing, you took Holland from them and then they took it back?","Hmmm interesting","For real first time you here bout proxy war?","Never heard the term, unless, I mean, you mean like during the Cold War. \n\nIt\u2019s really a widely known term?","Yea basically like. Where for example you and me battle for the winning position through the other nations","That is the case with stitches and myself everytime we play","So... you're aligned with Chewbacca against me again? Or just relying on him to keep me busy while you devour Luke Skywalker?\n\nI'm very happy to intervene with Han Solo once the situation is resolving in the West, but there's not a lot I can do about them when all my units bar one are busy over here.","Actually neither one of those \"accusations\" lol.\nChewbacca handcuffed me with \"I will throw myself towards you and let Yoda have all the gains if you don't pull back.\" :\/ and with Han Solo needing someone to apply the brakes on him it was a self-made decision","Ohhh Obi-Wan Kenobi you're going to be the death of me XD\n\nTalk to me next time, okay? I'm really not all about gaining the most SCs I can. There are other considerations, you know?\n\nSo you partly pulled back off Chewbacca so I'd be stuck fighting him on my own so that... someone can apply the brakes to Han Solo? I hope you weren't expecting my armies and fleets up here facing Chewbacca to be involved in that. Maybe R2-D2 can do it, since he doesn't have to worry about me any time soon?","What would you have done with Chewbacca's threat of throwing all his centers to you?","Talked to you two about dividing his centers. I admit I was hoping to get into Spain and Portugal ^^ \n\nBut I had no plans for Paris or Brest, and whatever we agreed I'd stick to.","Right but my question still stands unanswered.","Anyway that this point you can have most of Chewbacca if you'd like. I'm already committed in the north east","We can work together against Han Solo when the time comes for you.","Then... I don't understand the question? I thought I did answer that?","You mean what would I have done in your shoes, if he made the threat?","Right","...what I asked you to ^^ If I'm in an alliance with someone against a mutual target and the target tries to offer all his centers to one of the allies, I talk to them. The winners get to agree the terms.","In a perfect world yes. But there's such a thing as spite.","I guess so. I try to avoid it, but no one exists in a vacuum.\n\nAt least,  not yet!","Lol","Don\u2019t you lol my dreams! ^^\n\nANYway. I meant that I don\u2019t feel I\u2019d have made the same decision (rightly or wrongly), but that I understand why you did. So no stress.","Lol","; ) hehe","I see you!! Good work Ms. Pope! Good work.","Sadly I was in a business meeting and missed my turn","So what's R2-D2 doing?","Not sure, waiting on a reply.","This game is so slow","I do like the weekend pause though!!","Since I basically spent the weekend hand in hand with Bean, me too! I'll make time to pay attention if I need to, but I enjoyed the break.","100%","How are your family doing? Did you end up working over the weekend, or get some time with them? \n\nWe had Father's Day in my part of the world, so touching base and sharing lunch with my dad as well.","That's very nice Vivian. So glad to hear that!! And yes I took the weekend off to feed into my family","My wife and son of course","Wow you have R2-D2 by the balls haha","Well he was wide open and I offered him a hand against Darth Vader while all his units were facing Han Solo. \n\nHe was kind enough to convoy me to Albania, although a season later than we'd discussed.","You going for that sexy stab or helping take Vienna back?","Well it looks like you've finally got Chewbacca on the ropes. I'm still mostly stuck in the east, but want to move (smoothly, together) to cut his legs out from under him?\n\nAnd what comes next?","Let's take out Chewbacca first and see where we both are at that point","I get port and you get Spain?","Sure, let's do it. I've been sitting in Mar long enough I'm reasonably sure I can dart out without him trying to take Mar back.","Yea and I doubt he'll even try to take mar back out of spite to me","Well, it's Fall. After Winter he won't have the chance.\n\nI'd appreciate if we could leave Por and Spa in their soon to be new ownership until at least the end of 1908? \n\nI definitely do want to find a way to work with you, but let's make that undertaking in case that proves to be impossible.\n\nDeal?","You've got yourself a deal and have my word on it","We both can benefit from that deal","A\/t became a thing again","I noticed. I'm attempting to turn T back against A, but I'm not holding my breath","Wonder if I could help influence that","It'd be welcome. I recognise we're all anonymous here, but I'm getting a little sick of being stabbed by my eastern ally repeatedly","Me: \"Wait, didn't we JUST do this and that's why I'm saving you now?\"","Lol that sux","Honestly I now want to wipe them both out. But that leaves me without a solid ally, so I suppose I'll need to forgive one of them.","I'm not solid :\/","?","I want you to be \ud83d\ude42","I suppose that was throwing out a line and hoping we could work together - you're in a position to help me East and West.","\"\nObi-Wan Kenobi\nNew Message\nMessage\nLet's take out Chewbacca first and see where we both are at that point\" didn't exactly fill me with confidence, but if you tell me you're going to do a thing then I trust you.","Let's make this easy. Eliminate everyone else and draw with my Darth Vader queen","Done and done. Who says an Obi-Wan Kenobi King can\u2019t have more than one Queen? Henry did it.","I'd be happy to crown you queen as well. How you like the title \"Queen Vashti\" ?","Not the *best* predecessor, if Darth Vader is Esther?\n\nI\u2019ll take Queen Bianca thanks. Or Queen Italia","Hahah, you know the story :) I likey!!","My parents ^^","I like Queen Italia, but feels like there should be a bit more to the name","Bianca Di Medici was the handle I was using earlier. \u201cPope\u201d is wrong on SO many levels","Whatever you prefer my queen ;)","My King, what do you want my F Spa to do? Up to MAO or guard Marseilles?","I'd like to set up a convoy line","Well don't forget some of us still have a war to win in the east! Can I count on you and my co-queen to help press down through Luke Skywalker?","Absolutely my dear!! Which is why I want to set up a convoy line. Imagine an Obi-Wan Kenobi convoy into Syria where Darth Vader is a part of it!!!!","Want to start lining up the fleets right away?","I have enough to go all the way to ion with Queen Esther starting it off in nth sea","And then probably goes without saying my beautiful foreign Queens would love to allow their benevolent King Shetan The 1st to close out his empire at 12 scs generously bequeathing 11 scs to each Queen.

(Not sure if that ends with a question mark or an exclamation point haha) whew. I'm glad I'm not actually a king.

Cheers my Queen","We can do the convoy in the final season of this game, my King \ud83d\ude42 I will set up my side of the convoy in Spring, and will be able to convoy as far as possible in Fall\n\nPlease do ensure Chewbacca is dealt with this year my King, so we can finish with a simple 3-way union in marriage.

{"messages":["Good morning my Sultan, how are things? We have a number of common interests (the Balkans, R2-D2, the Med, Luke Skywalker) and I'm looking forward to discussing them with you. Please accept this gift of fine Yoda Chianti!","Buongiorno! I hope we can honestly discuss these interests as well. Are you planning to open agressively?","Buongiorno!\n\nThere's only so aggressive I *can* be, Sultan! I haven't even mentioned the idea of a Lepanto to R2-D2 and I'm principally focused on getting a build in Tunis or Greece this year. Where are you looking at things?","Well, I would strongly encourage you to visit Tunis. In return, I'd be happy to offer you support if sometime in the future you decide the map has too much R2-D2 on it.","Well... Tunis is pretty much guaranteed for me, and it will be there in 1902 if I find juicier fruit in 1901. Are you suggesting I try my luck in Trieste instead, and that you'll be happy to support me the war against R2-D2 that will likely immediately follow? \n\nOne of my friends is in another game where his I and a friendly T are advancing well against a chaotic Luke Skywalker\/R2-D2 alliance.","you had me at \"against R2-D2\". Yes, I think that the two of us working together against R2-D2\/Luke Skywalker would be a good plan. And later when we trust each other better I'm sure we could coordinate in the Mediterranean to help you expand westward  while I expand north?","Some cautious discussions with R2-D2 this Spring, and I\u2019ve committed not to try for Trieste this year so it looks as though it will be a single build winter. For you as well, or have you been able to negotiate safe passage to Greece?","I'm working on it...If I get a promise from R2-D2 I'll let you know.","Welp, it appears that neither R2-D2 nor Luke Skywalker are speaking to me. This suggests they might be working together, in case that's useful information.","That is interesting! I'm still getting press from both, though nothing that suggests a solid alliance between the two. Nerves, uncertainties and some remarks heard - directly or indirectly - from Luke Skywalker that make me wonder what his long game is here.","Last turn, Luke Skywalker offered conflicting promises to me and R2-D2 both (or so I've heard). Once I found that out, I never heard from either of them again. So it's not too many dots to connect to think they may have some kind of arrangement...\nI would guess maybe they plan to split the map roughly horizontally and take me out first?","It could be so. It looks like they're not coordinating well if that's their plan, though. I was aligned with them last turn, but a few promises didn't quite flower to fruition and right now I'm more concerned with what Chewbacca is doing in southern Spain.","Apparently Luke Skywalker just makes empty promises to everyone (so I hear from northern players, anyway), so I think it's best if Luke Skywalker is just ignored or treated with extreme suspicion. \n\nYou mean you're worried about Chewbacca seizing the Mediterranean?","That was what I meant yes, since I ended up leaving Tunis for the new year. Seeing the bounce on Munich allayed that concern nicely though, and I\u2019ve exchanged a few notes with Chewbacca since that convince me I\u2019m able to look to my East for a little longer at least.","And yes, Luke Skywalker does seem more than a little promise happy - does that make him a commitment phobe do you think, or is he counting on some of us to say no so he\u2019s not stuck in contradictory commitments?","Probably the latter.\n\nSo, does focusing on the East mean that there's anything I might be able to help you with?","That\u2019s a good question. \n\nClassicly I suppose I should be focusing on a Lepanto approach, and I\u2019m certainly uncomfortable with your fleets in Con and Smy. It\u2019s also the bill of goods Luke Skywalker\u2019s been trying to sell R2-D2 and I. \n\nOn the other hand that depends on us being able to trust what Luke Skywalker is up to and frankly I\u2019m not certain of him at all. I was committed to supporting A Ser into Bul this year in exchange for his support into Greece... but if we go back to the order log we can both see that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nWhat do you have in mind? My immediate objectives are taking Tunis, keeping my coastal waters Yoda and finding a friendship\/alliance I can trust to take me to the late game, hopefully a 2-way draw.","Ah, what a relief to finally hear what sounds like honesty!\n\nThose fleets were mainly meant to defend against a lepanto, and, fate willing, maybe seize the black sea that I naively ceded when I was young and trusting. Point is, they're not a threat to you especially since you're the only neighbor of mine willing to talk to me. They might even be useful for you in a few turns, if I'm still around.\n\nI assume you want do dedicate your Nap fleet to snagging Tunis. And does the \"coastal waters\" thing mean you're concerned about the Adriatic? If not, then, what I hoped was that you might be willing to support Bul-Ser while stabbing Albania from the sea. This could set us up to start pushing back on R2-D2 from the South. (And I'd support *you* into Serbia if I thought that'd be worth anything, but given that Bul is surrounded by enemies I just doubt the support would go through).","I'd like that, and I agree it's a huge relief to cut through the nervous diplomatic double-speak! \n\nI think it's perfectly understandable for Han Solo to want to defend against a Lepanto, especially when Yoda is sounding cautious and doesn't really have many other options to expand. I've just built a second fleet, but then I think I need that to escape my boot whichever way I'm going. \n\nI am concerned about the Adriatic, but not sure I'm moving into it this year. I agree with your analysis of Bul (you're GOING to get hit) although it might be hard to bring up a new unit into Bul to replace your army there. Are you hoping to feed F Con to the east coast? You might need an Aegean fleet to force your way up, which should probably be yours unless  you're willing to extend me that much trust this early.\n\nWe're assuming a supported attack on Serbia will get you in, yes? R2-D2 does have a *lot* of units around there, cut at Albania or no.\n\nBianca de' Medici","I agree with you that it's not likely to work given all the units R2-D2 has around, but it's the best I could come up with. I was planning to move a fleet to the Aegean for support next season, as you suggest. \n\nDo you know anything about what R2-D2 and Luke Skywalker are planning?","(also I'm open to any counter offers if you have them)","Reliably? No.\n\nGenerally speaking I think they\u2019re trying to defeat you, but how they\u2019re planning on doing it I\u2019m not clear. They both lied to me last turn - and, as far as I can tell, to each other. \n\nI don\u2019t have a better offer really, except that if we make any progress against R2-D2 I would expect Luke Skywalker to start courting us instead.","That sounds on-brand for Luke Skywalker. It\u2019ll fall on deaf Han Solo ears though.\nSo, can I count on your support?","Yes. Let\u2019s do this thing, my friend.\n\nB. de M","I'm getting nervous about R2-D2 in Serbia and Albania, and I don't want to lose Greece. I'm also (sorry!) getting nervous about your two fleets facing west what with my more experienced friend telling me that Yoda and Han Solo \"always fight\". \n\nThat's not true, is it?","I'm still not going to attack you, but... I think I can't attack R2-D2 either here. Sorry. I need to sit tight and wait for Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca to commit themselves. Maybe Chewbacca will butt out of the Med with his northern worries, but maybe he won't too and in Yoda we *need* freedom of the seas.","I understand your hesitation to attack R2-D2, but if you don't trust them then it's better to resist sooner rather than later when they become more powerful at my expense. \nYour experienced friend is wrong; there's no reason Han Solo and Yoda *have* to fight, even if it does happen somewhat often. In this instance, you're the last person on the board I'd want to fight with.","Well, I'm glad we didn't agree to stab R2-D2, actually, since it looks like R2-D2 has flipped on Luke Skywalker. \nI'd still like to help you out any way I can, but it looks like you might be focusing on the west for a bit. Just know that as far as I can tell neither R2-D2 nor I have intentions with Greece right now.","(R2-D2 did start to talk to me again and said as much)","Thank you! I\u2019m much happier with my suspicions drawn to a worthy target, and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t start fighting R2-D2 in the Balkans while Chewbacca ran up my back. Do you have a plan for getting back control of the Black Sea? You certainly don\u2019t have to look out for me any more, we have a Chewbaccaman to scold ^^","Don\u2019t you worry about the black sea, this ol\u2019 sultan has a few tricks up her sleeve \ud83d\ude09","I look forward to seeing what you do next, your fleets are certainly ready!","(Sending to Yoda and R2-D2)\n\nChewbacca, Darth Vader, and Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s behavior combined with some things Obi-Wan Kenobi has said to me smell of a triple alliance between those three. Do you agree or have any additional evidence?\nIf so, I want to make sure southeast europe is prepared to push back against such a threat","A few things I\u2019ve heard sound Triplish and the current Chewbacca position certainly looks like they\u2019ve made some sort of deal doesn\u2019t it? They aren\u2019t going to sneak by me though, so it really depends what EG do.","So I know this is last minute, but I just got R2-D2 to support me from Ser into Rum. I was wondering if you'd be willing to bump\/borrow Bul this turn? I highly doubt R2-D2 would try and swipe it from you","I just don't want Luke Skywalker to have it","Too last minute sorry, I was asleep. I\u2019ll go see what happened in the update.","It looks like you'll be able to push back on Chewbacca a bit this year. I think you and R2-D2 should work together to move you into Piedmont...what do you think?","I was also wondering whether your Greece army might be willing to support Con-Bul ec?","Good morning my friendly Sultan! Still a bit asleep here, but agree with both your points. Happy to support you into Bul (ec) this season, and very much hoping R2-D2 will support me in driving Chewbacca back out of my immediate area. How have you been? Nearing the end of a *very* long week here and looking forward to spending more time looking over the map.","Well I'm so glad you'll be taking some time to get back to what's important. \n\nI've been not-so-busy and looking at the map kind of a lot...thanks for the support and I'll gently try to convince R2-D2 in your favor as well","Hahahaha. Well, it\u2019s Diplomacy and SO and not having to spend all day up to my ears in Campus things. But yes, important to focus on what\u2019s important.\n\nI appreciate your support!","I'd sure hate to be Chewbacca right now! Great job claiming Mare Nostrum \ud83d\ude42","Thanks! How are things in the east? Still have Luke Skywalker well contained or do you need anything from Greece or the rest of me?\n\nWe\u2019re at your service here, while not wanting to drive in where we aren\u2019t needed","Don\u2019t need anything just trying to give credit where it\u2019s due","Congratulations on your build! How are things in the East with Luke Skywalker dying from all sides? Do you have any immediate plans for where we go next from here?\n\nI imagine Chewbacca would be open to a deal that had me moving away... again.","Sorry I didn't respond to this...I hope that move to the Ionian is not signalling that you're ready to turn on me","I moved there so I could convoy Greece out, since he\u2019s not doing any good there any more. Did you have another use for him?","Congrats on smooshing Luke Skywalker so effectively!","Ah thank you but the smooshing was so effective that now Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader are swooping in like buzzards! \n\nAnd that's a relief about Greece. Does this mean no truce with Chewbacca, and you'll keep expanding that way?","I haven't agreed a truce with Chewbacca. If Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader were still attacking Chewbacca, I'd absolutely be driving on hard (why I sent the fleet back for reinforcements) but now... I'm torn. If I keep hitting Chewbacca, that frees Obi-Wan Kenobi (and Darth Vader I guess) to push through the last Luke Skywalkern centre and come after the three of us from the East, right?And pushes Chewbacca back into their arms. How do I avoid that?","Ah the truth comes out. In hindsight I should have realized it was too good to be true","It was true at the time I said it was. But yes, negotiations went on.","It's important to me that you do understand the situation changed there. \n\nWith both you and R2-D2 advising the A Greece wasn't needed there my fleet came over for exactly the reason I suggested... but then after it arrived I had my Chewbacca re-evaluation. And now Darth Vader has jumped R2-D2 and my ally seems to have lost his conviction about killing you, and so - why, I am re-evaluating again.","Well at this point the only thing I could offer you as an ally is help in taking dots from R2-D2. If that's something you'd be more interested in than taking dots from me, then we could work together?","On my way to bed. Let me look at this and come back to you in the morning. I think there is a definite chance, and if we do this I\u2019ll be perfectly straight with you before we start (and likewise if I decide to keep fighting you).\n\nThis will only work if we surprise him though \ud83d\ude03","Sorry I ended up being basically offline all day (and I'm involved in a new tournament, so busy setting up those games). \n\nYes, I'm more interested in taking dots from R2-D2 at this point than I am in taking them from you. If we schedule a bounce in Smyrna in the Spring, could I count on your support into Bulgaria in the Fall?","Hmm long term I\u2019d sooner have Rum and Bul for myself while you take the western holdings...could we either agree to some temporary arrangement or could I promise you support into Serbia instead?","That makes perfect sense to me. I was thinking in terms of what you could support me into, but if I can get that build this Fall I\u2019m happy to leave it and let you take it for the following year - and Rum too. \n\nBlack Sea territories are much easier for you to hold, and I need you strong if we\u2019re going to drive north together.","Okay glad we\u2019re on the same page :)\n\nHave you heard anything from R2-D2\/Darth Vader that might affect how we should proceed? R2-D2 claims to want to leave Ukraine open for me this season though I\u2019m not sure whether to trust it","R2-D2 is starting to get nerves about all my units heading this way, but I\u2019m reminding him this was part of our plan to kill you. Currently I\u2019m offering to help R2-D2 defend against Darth Vader where he\u2019s badly out of position.","So am I assisting Greece into Bul this season?","I'm also wondering if you're going to follow through on your promised assist of R2-D2 into Vienna. I think if we're going to stab, it's better for you not to and to fall back to venice instead.","That\u2019s up to you, friend. Normally when I stab I prefer to stab hard, but if you\u2019re having concerns and warning R2-D2 about our plans then they weren\u2019t likely to work anyway. \n\nHow do you want to do this? Committed stab and pivot north or revert to our prior alliances and see if R2-D2 is willing to commit to a direction - any direction - that I can support him to?\n\nYou know my preference, but I don\u2019t want to push you into something you\u2019re uncomfortable with.","I don\u2019t *think* I\u2019ve said anything to R2-D2 to indicate our collaboration, although R2-D2 is suspicious anyway. All I did this season was ask whether you two were collaborating, to which R2-D2 said basically \u201cI sure hope so but we\u2019ll see\u201d\n\n \nI\u2019m wholly comfortable with going forward with you on a decisive attack on R2-D2.","Okay I'm committed. Let's do this decisive attack on R2-D2, with your supporting me into Bulgaria from Greece this season and my getting out of the way for you to take Bulgaria yourself in the new year. We'll work out how we break Rum, but if the best solution is me moving into it then we'll work out a schedule for me to get out of it too - Black Sea coastal territories are yours.\n\nAgreed?","Agreed. I\u2019ve placed your support order.","It's been a long weekend. Getting back into the dip mindset, do you think you can trust Obi-Wan Kenobi to keep off your north?\n\nIf so, let's look at getting you Rum and Bul this year.","I think that\u2019s a good plan. Are you willing to leave Bul this fall?","Done! Taking Rumania in the Spring?","If possible, yes","I\u2019d also love it if you could move your fleet out of the Aegean and into greece or something, just to take a little presssure off me?","That's fine. I'm using it to cover Greece this season.\n\nAegean DMZ?","Agreed \ud83d\ude42","R2-D2 has asked me to support them into Bul this season. Since you're giving it up to me anyway and it will be useful to us to have their trust, should I do it?","Oh dear I'm sorry it looks like to you didn't get my message. Let me know if there's some way I can make it up to you!","Ouch! Unfortunately you\u2019re right, I wasn\u2019t around for your first message at 1:10 am and so wasn\u2019t in a position to suggest anything else. What does their trust buy us, other than forcing a disband of one of our units due to complete the defeat of our mutual enemy this turn?","I'm really sorry I forgot that you're not in a U.S. timezone. I didn't realize it would be such an issue because to me, it just made sense that you'd move into Serbia with Bulgaria and support from Albania (so that support couldn't be cut by Rum).","...and that trust gets us information. Like, for instance, I could have told you not to move with Albania if it weren't for our time difference issue. I really am sorry and I'll be more aware of it in the future","Ah no, I knew you were attacking Rumania this turn so I waited in Bulgaria to ensure he couldn\u2019t simply retreat in there and offer you the same problem all over again in Fall. The move out was due in Fall (yes into Ser) so that you could reclaim your rightful Black Sea borders as scheduled \ud83d\ude03","Not sure I have the armies to do that now; I\u2019ll look at the map when I\u2019m more awake, but may need you to take a more proactive role if that\u2019s okay.","I'm already on it! I'll get back to you in a couple hours","So, Con to Bul (ec)? I can support you there from Gre and if you support from Rum as well should get you back where you should be.","I'll do that but just so you know R2-D2 told me they were going for greece this turn.","From where?","Bulgaria","Not a problem then - provided you hit Bul with Con supported from Rum","Okay great","That went more or less according to plan, thanks for your support!","I want you to know that despite my move to sc instead of ec, I plan to honor the DMZ of the aegean. I was just being overcautious in case you decided not to honor it.","Should we look into spring then? What are you trying to achieve this year?","I was just asking myself that. Expanding northwards against Darth Vader\/Obi-Wan Kenobi seems logical for me.","What are your goals?","Since R2-D2 is... a little more back in the game than I\u2019d planned, they have to be my focus. After that I fully intend to stick with my alliance and drive to the final endgame. :3","Just not looking at those moves

{"messages":["Hi there, we should talk. I've communicated with Darth Vader at this point and I've heard from Obi-Wan Kenobi and keen to hear your strategic thoughts on the overall picture. Where can we draw a line of DMZs? Where (if anywhere) can we work together more proactively? It's reaching a bit, but if I ever have a spare fleet would it be useful as a loaner to your lineup in the north?","Hey hey.","To be honest, just got done with a day from hell, so not really thinking big picture at the moment yet.  Placeholder orders are more or less just a standard Chewbacca opening, just starting to touch base with all the neighbors.","I read you Chewbacca, and sorry to hear about the apocalypse on earth. Pretty standard Yoda opening as well, I'm neither more nervous or less of my neighbours than usual. \n\nOnce you get your press off, maybe lie down and listen to your favourite tunes? I know that helps me when I'm blue.","Oh, I'm not blue - just worn out.  It's been a hectic week :)\nI think I'll stick close to a standard opening, get in position to drop a bunch of fleets","Sounds good! Off Brest please - seeing them appear in Marseilles will set off all sorts of alarms in La Bella Italia ^_^ I\u2019m glad you\u2019re \u201conly\u201d very tired. What is it you do, when you\u2019re not governing the fates of a nation?\n\nEngineering student here.","I design software systems for electronic health records.","What's your focus?  I was originally an electrical engineering student, myself.","Aerospace engineering :3 I finish my course at the end of next year and... then have to actually find work, if I can. I enjoy the university but don't want to spend my whole life in Academia, you know?","No, no you probably do not want to do that.  \ud83d\ude03","Nothing too new this turn, good to see you're on good terms with your neighbours - or at least good enough to quickly grab your neutrals this year!","We should probably talk DMZs then, yeah? I don't have any intention of going into Piedmont any time soon, and really do either us want to see any naval adventures in the Gulf of Lyon, the Western Med or North Africa?","That's the plan - and, yes, it would be very nice to keep the western Med area free of fleets.","Anything I should be worried about there? Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader seem to be coordinating well, but at least they're leaving your borders well alone. Do we have DMZs in every territory I mentioned, or only the Western Med?","We do, and we should be good. I imagine there will be fallout to deal with from the attempt at Munich","Touching base, anything new from our friends to the West? And where is the Army in Marseilles headed? We Yodas are known for our warm and personal hospitality, but prefer t","*to extend that on a more individual basis than to whole armies at a time.","Ouch! That hurt, though as you see we did spot you coming. Are you still intent on trying to force your way past my defense, or are you ready to talk? ^^","Always ready to talk!  Driving now though - be a couple hours before I can pull up the map","Now that I'm home, we could probably work out a set of moves that keeps me in position to move elsewhere next turn","\"Keeps me in position\" and \"moving elsewhere\" do feel a *little* contradictory I have to say. Still, if we can avoid butting heads pointlessly for the next three years I'm all ears! \n\nWhere else did you have in mind? Your Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi borders seem a little bare, so I trust there are diplomatic ties keeping them safe and secure?","That's the theory. And you missed the time component -keeping me in place this turn, so I can move the other direction next turn (which is harder to do if I advance this turn)","You're not going to advance this turn. I appreciate the thought, but I'm already there and have nothing pulling me away in another direction. \n\nOr was that your point?","More or less - but we need to make SURE I don't advance.  I mean, you can't effectively cover all of North Africa, Western Med, Tuscany, and Tyrolia, hence the getting on the same page \ud83d\ude42","And that's what I was talking about - keeping me in MAO would have made it easier to flip in the Spring","Ok, that works. Looks like some chaos between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader we can maybe use to disentangle","I think Obi-Wan Kenobi is being very clever, and is using Luke Skywalker's ambitious early play to get an advantage while you and Darth Vader are committed. But then he's the same player who warned me about an incoming Western Triple a few seasons ago, so... \n\nHow would you like us to disengage? Planning on just turning around and going home, or something more dynamic?","Good question. Stand by while I get a feel for what's going on with the rest of the board. How secure are you feeling with the R2-D2n?","Reasonably secure. He's in Tyrolia because I asked him to come, if that's what you mean :3","It is, yes. And funny enough, my \"full push on Yoda\" order set last turn would have had me ordered there, but I was trying not to push too hard. \nI think I'm inclined to mostly just straight up go away, just putting one unsupported move to tyrrhenian to keep you from full-pressing a follow-up.  Does that work for you?  That would let you either force your way in and still put one on Ionian, or force Ionian and just use one to keep tyrrhenian empty.","It does in principle, yes. It\u2019s after midnight here and I\u2019m heading to bed, but I\u2019ll have a closer look at the map tomorrow (today now!) and give you a fuller response then. Maybe we can plot out some actual moves then. Where was the one unsupported move coming from, so I can run a sandbox tomorrow over coffee?","That would be Lyons. I was going to stay something cheeky, but it's actually pretty obvious which one I'd want to back up, and which is want to hold as a delay.","Ugh, autocorrect making it look like I've had a stroke...","So, not *quite* what you said you were going to do. \n\nI didn't mind disposing of the offending unit in Piedmont though, so you won't have to have him courtmartialed! I half expected a convoy into North Africa, though I now see you have larger threats to worry about to your north. Luke Skywalker coordinating with a powerful Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader descending on your open borders!","Eh?  I did exactly what I said I was doing :)\nBut, yes, you can clearly see that not only was I already backing away from you, I'm now *highly motivated* to fully commit to that.","The attack on Tyrolia wasn't *precisely* the same thing of \"I'm pulling back\" as I expected, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt I guess. I'm not really sure what you were trying to do there honestly, unless you were hoping to menace Munich from the south?","*sigh*\nAlright then. Spain won't be supporting Marseille so you don't need to cut it -you'd just be helping Obi-Wan Kenobi by doing so, and screw him. So if you want, you definitely have the option of shifting wmed - naf,tys - WMed.\nThat would let you take Marseille and be in position to still take Spain in the fall, and\/or contest the mid-Atlantic.","Agggh, I must have been half asleep. I didn't hit the thumb (or that was when the bot was down)","Let me look at this and work out what we're doing.","I was indeed hoping to menace Munich. \nFor this turn, I'm also willing to support WMed - mao","I'm generally in favour of that idea. Where is MAO going?","I am generally in favour of plan \"screw him\". I have a few reasons, and in hindsight I can see the strings tied to my shoulders from a few seasons back. Would I be fair in assuming he set you to fighting me at about the same time he warned me you were coming?","So confirming you'd like me to move F WMed - MAO in Spring, and will support me there (from Spain?) if I don't cut you that season? If I can get Marseilles, Spain and ultimately Portugal I would be overjoyed... though I confess I don't completely understand why you're helping me do this. \n\nI think I need to understand?","Yes, he's been pulling some strings. As to why,  with three on my doorstep, I'm going to lose dots. All things being equal, I'd rather they go to the person that didn't betray me.  As for mao, it's going to Obi-Wan Kenobi. That may cut a support and you'll just bounce mao open. It may also walk in behind a moving Obi-Wan Kenobi fleet and get you into mao. Hard to say. But either is better for you than letting an Obi-Wan Kenobi fleet in. \ud83d\ude00","I agree, and well reasoned. I\u2019ll keep your secrets (although he does have a knack for reading the board), and plan closely with you for next year\u2019s moves.","Support's in the box - do with that what ye will.","Thank you! I\u2019ll see to it that it\u2019s not wasted.","So... we're changing back again then? \n\nI don't object to someone defending themselves, but you could have said something \ud83d\ude02 I haven't lied to you yet and don't intend on starting now.","Sonafabitch - did I forget to hit thumbs-up on the last message?  Yeah, I did NOT mean for that to be a surprise to you, and I'm deeply sorry, cause you did me a solid and it looks like I reacted by being a dick.","So the Triple is back on? I see Obi-Wan Kenobi has decided he can afford to kill Luke Skywalker now, though he hasn\u2019t asked me to distract Han Solo recently.","Nope. He's killed the triple idea for me. So... What pull would make you happy?","What is a \"pull\"? I'm sorry, getting asked a lot about terms I don't recognise in this game.","Oh! You mean \"pull off the board\"?","I don't see any reason you'd be inclined to make me *too* happy if I was still trying to kill you, but since I'm apparently the only one doing that last turn I don't feel any particular obligation to stick with that plan either. \n\nIf you remove an army, I'd be happy to see that as a sign of good will!\n\nI do want to keep my build, but get that you wouldn't want to lose a home centre long term - right? \n\nSimplest answer if I go back east is to sit an army in Marseilles while everyone else leaves and lets you focus north. \n\nNext simplest is... A Mar moving to Spain I guess and letting you reclaim Mar uncontested?\n\nOr we could do something more aggressive, but without me in your backyard I'm sure you could make some progress against Obi-Wan Kenobi, if that's who you're looking at?","You sum it up well. Army gascony is probably the overall friendliest yet most ambiguous pull. It takes pressure off Marseille, but would let me keep pressing Obi-Wan Kenobi if you backed off. And I'm happy to leave Marseille Yoda for a while if the issue is off me - don't especially need that as a build spot in the near term","We should talk about how we\u2019re going to disengage, so there\u2019s no confusion and no temptation to warn anyone what we\u2019ve got planned for them ^^","I\u2019m trusting your fleets are headed north, and I\u2019m sending everything other than A Mar and F GOL (this turn) east. I hope to send F GOL East next season as well","We're really on incompatible time schedules :)\nFleets are headed north, so is Burgundy.","You may want to cover Spain.","Cover or try to take it?","Same thing, mate.

We have to be careful being in the middle of someone else's conflict.","Yes yes, i agree","I think any conflict between us will only result in one of us losing followed quickly by the other losing.  So should we have some sort of non-aggression pact?","Yes, that would be bad for both of us","how are you feeling about Yoda?","Seems to be working with me on getting some Intel. I'm curious about your feelings on Luke Skywalker?","Have you heard anything from Han Solo?","It seems like Luke Skywalker is aiming for him","Yeah it would seem that way, but Han Solo told me that Luke Skywalker was not conspiring against him.","interested in taking out Luke Skywalker?","Always","Do you have any plans for the fall? I am up for continuing our non-aggression pact this season. Hopefully we can work together to take out Luke Skywalker in central europe","Not yet, talking to people to see if they may want to make moves on Luke Skywalker.","Are you cool with me moving into Boh? I'm still agreeable to a non-aggression pact, just would like to be more useful against Luke Skywalker","Sure that sounds reasonable","moving to Tyr to help Yoda, would appreciate you not taking my open vienna","Yep, can do that. Have you talked to Chewbacca about Tyr? Not sure his exact plans but you two should be able to take on Yoda if you coordinate","I'm trying to help Yoda, at least until Luke Skywalker is gone. I figure we have to take out one of the countries on the outside before worrying about other countries in the central","Ok sounds good","are you working with Chewbacca to take out Obi-Wan Kenobi, or just in a non-aggression against them?","Non aggression","cool cool cool","Can you tell what\u2019s going on with Han Solo?","they're suspicious of an alliance between you Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca, which seems at least part true. If they're ready I'm going to try to push into Luke Skywalker with them. Yoda is watching my back, and I have a non-aggression with you so I'm going to leave myself pretty vulnerable.","Ok, my main focus right now is Luke Skywalker too. If you, me, and Han Solo can coordinate against Luke Skywalker we should be able to get him off our backs quickly","I'm going to suggest me supporting Han Solo into Rum and the my moving my army in Bud to Gal to pressure War.","Sounds good to me","Want to move your army into Boh to help me in case Luke Skywalker gets feisty? Trying to make moves to take them out.","What are your plans with your army in Tyr?","Helping Yoda with Piedmont. You're probably fine leaving your army where it is actually. Would you help me if Luke Skywalker tries to move into my territory though?","Ok cool. Yeah, if we are able to ward off Luke Skywalker successfully, we can figure out a plan to split his supply centers fairly between us","are you moving against Obi-Wan Kenobi?","Trying to","cool, I moved my unit into Vie so I can't build one this winter. Im hoping to push at Luke Skywalker either Gal or War. Just wanted to let you know when I start moving.","After Luke Skywalker is taken out are you planning on going after Obi-Wan Kenobi?","And if so do you want to let me take war and Ill help you take Stp and make moves into Swe","The problem is that after Luke Skywalker is out, all of us in the west will have to start worrying about Han Solo","Have you been able to make any plans with Han Solo against Luke Skywalker?","Going to support their push into Ukr","if you support me into War Ill help you take Stp and can help later deal with Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Would you be open to supporting me into War and then I'll support you into moscow\/down into Han Solo?","I could be. What are your plans with Obi-Wan Kenobi once Luke Skywalker is gone? It seems it would be more beneficial to have Stp and take over scandanavia. But obviously we would both want War given its location to us.","Just wanted to know what you see your self doing in the next couple turns.","I\u2019m trying to work with Obi-Wan Kenobi as long as possible...I\u2019m hesitant to make  promises or plans based on StP because I\u2019m using it at a bargaining chip for the long game","I\u2019m hoping to get Chewbacca or Yoda out next","And use Obi-Wan Kenobi to do so","Are you still focused east or do you plan on moving into Yoda?","So be it, I'll support you into War.  I'd prefer getting rid of Chewbacca since Yoda has worked really well with me. I'd suggest knocking out Chewbacca then going after Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Well Yoda is watching my back against Han Solo so I don't really want to fight them. so more focused on the East.","Ok thanks! I owe you","That makes sense. Yeah Yoda has been helpful against Chewbacca so far, hopefully us in the middle can keep working well together","I think in the end its either going to be all three of us central countries left. Or whichever betrays the other two survives the longest before being taken out.","Agree","If think you can handle Obi-Wan Kenobi on the west you could probably book from Bal into Sweden and then they're cut off from the East. It would make it easier to clean up the eastern stragglers after.","Yes that\u2019s very tempting.","I\u2019m still waiting to hear back from Obi-Wan Kenobi before making any aggressive moves. At this point I need Chewbacca to be weaker before having Obi-Wan Kenobi completely after me, I don\u2019t think I could manage both of them haha","forgot you still have some border with Obi-Wan Kenobi","Yes, unfortunately","Thank you for following through with support!","Luke Skywalker is basically done. I think we need to start being concerned with Han Solo and try to prevent him from creeping into Luke Skywalker's supply centers","Of course","I agree, but i think we need to worry about Obi-Wan Kenobi as well. I think the easiest way to split it would be for me to take Mos and you Stp. Yoda and I surround Han Solo and then you contain Obi-Wan Kenobi until Chewbacca is gone then Obi-Wan Kenobi is the focus.","i can move Gal into Ukr and Bud into Gal to gather forces to oppose Han Solo.","What does Obi-Wan Kenobi think about you taking Swe? Was that planned or are you taking them on now?","Yes Swe was planned","okay","I have gotten Obi-Wan Kenobi to agree to stop traveling south of StP in Luke Skywalker. Who knows how long that will actually last, but I think it's safe to assume he won't be interfering in Luke Skywalker too much for another season or two","Basically it seems like Obi-Wan Kenobi is waiting for you and Yoda to put a decent dent into Han Solo before making any huge moves east, so you\/we have time to nibble out Han Solo and build up in the meantime","Well if we start making moves on Han Solo would you be comfortable moving your army up to take Stp? It would certainly be a whole lot less stress having Obi-Wan Kenobi not trying to mess with the East.","It seems like Luke Skywalker is going to support either Obi-Wan Kenobi or Han Solo into Moscow this season to leave the game with whoever his preference is at that supply center (just won't be me haha).  Would you feel ok moving an army to Uk r to support me into Moscow? Then I can support you into Sev or let you have Warsaw. And between Moscow and an army I'm moving up north this season, I can keep Obi-Wan Kenobi at bay","Yes I can work with that","(sorry if it seems like some messages sent out of order, i realized I'd forgotten some bot thumbs)","Just finally talked to Han Solo haha. I think they are moving into Ukr this turn so maybe you should at least block them from moving inland that way","Can you support me into Moscow like we talked about before? Then I can keep Obi-Wan Kenobi out of our hair\/finish off Luke Skywalker","You've got my support into Moscow","Awesome, thank you!","That's funny you didn't happen to mention your aggression into Vie in your previous messages","I\u2019m very sorry, I didn\u2019t want to \ud83d\ude26 \n\nObi-Wan Kenobi has been threatening me and it was the only option I had to stay even with him without inciting his wrath","Obi-Wan Kenobi just asked me if Vie was staged. So either you're lying or they're trying to foment anger","He is very good at mind games. I know there\u2019s no way to prove it, but I\u2019m not lying\/haven\u2019t lied to you","thats all well and good, but how does it stop your aggression towards me? I need some sort of recompense or I won't be able to trust you.","I understand. What do you propose?","you leaving my territory","Han Solo is upset with my betrayal so now I have everyone to contend with","have you been conspiring with Yoda against me, because they're moving all their units west.","No, I haven't been conspiring with Yoda. My understanding was that Yoda was prepared to support you into Han Solo","If you really do want to have this central alliance, then I think it should be fair for me to have my territory back. You dont have to just give it back, I can have my units take it  back in force so it looks like we are fighting. Although I do think you should start to deal with Obi-Wan Kenobi considering how large they  are becoming.","The problem now is that if you use units to regain Vie, you'll just create an aisle for Han Solo to waltz into central Europe. Do you have any plans in place to stop him? Seems like you two had some sort of non-aggression agreement last season","Well I was exactly thrilled with the possibility of a western threat so I let them take Ukr to keep them from being too aggressive.","Wasn't*","also Obi-Wan Kenobi is about to move up to 8 units, if you move up right after Luke Skywalker's last army disbands then you can easily take Swe and Stp. Then Yoda and I will be able to deal with Han Solo.","Ah makes sense. Yeah Obi-Wan Kenobi is growing quickly. I\u2019m trying to figure out the best way to settle things with Chewbacca and Obi-Wan Kenobi on my western border first, and then figure out the best way forward from there. I think Obi-Wan Kenobi and Han Solo will be tied up with each other to our East for a season or two which buys us some time","So are you fine with me attacking Vie to keep up appearances?","I mean no, not happy about it haha. But seems like my only option at the moment","I wasn't happy about you taking it to begin with, but at least I'm telling you now.,","Haha fair enough","you both betrayed me first, but don't think you'll last much longer when all is said and done.","Betrayer Queen, would you like to assist me with hurting Yoda in exchange for my territory? They betrayed me harder so I want them to suffer the most.","Yes I\u2019m open to us discussing an agreement. What do you propose?","I lose, but Yoda loses territory in the process","I want to see the streets run red with their Ragu","Their color is green, so it would actually be Pesto","I want to see the streets run with a liquid they're known for","are you in?","Yes","not that it will change my current state of survival, but you're not going to betray me as well right?","I mean again","I don\u2019t want to be too outright in an attack against Yoda because I will likely need their support in Chewbacca soon, and I need to keep developing a good relationship with Han Solo before Yoda retaliates against me","But yes. I\u2019m in","Did you have any specific ideas for this season? I think I\u2019ll need Boh to support Munich, and I\u2019m concerned about losing War","destruction of the traitor Yoda?","I promise you that if you move Boh to Tyr I can follow up next season with a push into Ven.","I can\u2019t move Boh this season bc I need it to defend Munich against Chewbacca","Move Boh to Tyr, I'm going to try to take Tri, then I can support you into Yoda. My back is completely open so you don't have to worry about me stabbing you.","Also pretty sure Han Solo is chumped out and is going to let Yoda try to roll over me, which is obviously super cool for me. Just a heads up for when I'm gone.","Like I said, I can\u2019t move Boh this season because I can\u2019t afford to leave Munich undefended (and I need to move Kie back into holland). Going to try to move my northern units south I guess","okay, will you at least lie for me and say something about how I'm going for Tyr or something so that I can try to push back on Yoda a bit?","Sure thing","What are you planning on doing with your Vie unit this season?","Move for Tri. I'd like for you to move into Tyr so we can push into Yoda then you can take Vie after.","Or possibly take back Bud. If you could find it in your heart to not stab me again for a season or two.","Problem is that if I don\u2019t get another build this winter idk if I can keep pace with Yoda next year \ud83d\ude26","Well, if things go accordingly then Yoda should be losing two builds this season.","Any reason why you're not just taking Nwy?","Obi-Wan Kenobi and I are balanced and staying out of each other\u2019s way. He\u2019s respected my home territories thus far bc I haven\u2019t gone after him. Norway will be an easy grab for me when the time comes, no need to rock that boat quite yet","Well I guess we've seen that strategy certainly works.","Don\u2019t want him convincing Chewbacca to take me on","I'm going to try to convince Chewbacca to move against Yoda. You should to.","What's your plan this round?","Mostly defense, trying to move farther into Central Europe","So towards me?","Gal. It\u2019ll give me more options for next round (maybe take Bud back from Yoda? Or Rum)","Okay that was just a very vague statement. Had me a bit confused. Maybe move Boh-> Tyr then I can either support you into Tri or vice versa?","Then you can move down after Yoda is out?","Also you should really convince Chewbacca to help out against Yoda while they can still take advantage of it. Otherwise Yoda is going to walk into Chewbacca and get a bunch more production.","I can\u2019t move into Tyr this season, I need that unit to support Mun","Didn't Chewbacca just attack Obi-Wan Kenobi right there?","Yeah but Chewbacca was working with Obi-Wan Kenobi just one season before and he won\u2019t talk to me","From the looks of last season it would seem they had a Yoda betrayal moment.","Who knows","This game is rife with backstabbring, if only we could have all been friends.","\"I'm obviously fairly heavily committed to my attack on you at the moment, but I do consider Han Solo's shenanigans around Bulgaria a breach so before I forgive and forget I thought I'd offer you a chance to negotiate. \"","Are you going to?","Backstabbr you? No, I've told you, Yoda, and Han Solo my objective. The complete destruction of Yoda.","At least Yoda is warned haha","I'm more a Frontstabbr type of person.","You should buy up that domain name","You should really start attacking Yoda. You're just going to get surrounded if you don't start doing something now.","Not trying to tell you how to play, but if you dont move into Boh soon you're going to lose the opportunity and Yoda is

{"messages":["Hi Kaiser, greetings from her majesty the queen.\nI've been ordered to deliver this message to you in hopes of establishing an alliance. \nI wanted first to try a western triple with Chewbacca, and wrote to him accordingly. However Luke Skywalker has proposed a northern triple. Seeing as you are my first choice in alliance I'm good with which ever you would like to try. Hope to hear from you soon","Hi Queen, greetings from Darth Vader (the Kaserin, actually \ud83d\ude09 )","You're my first choice for an alliance as well. I was leaning towards the northern triple with Luke Skywalker. Have you tried or seen that before?","I haven't tried it or seen it","Wait is Kaserin female for kaiser? Lol","Hahah yeah","Ah well nice to know hehe. I hope I can give you a satisfactory experience ;) lol","It will be refreshing to flirt with a female instead of men lmao","https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=VBmMU_iwe6U","Long as you let me be the king that runs it with you baby!","We will be the best King and Queen ever!","So northern triple then?","Plans actually: King & queen and northern triple","That\u2019s the plan!","A very romantic plan!! I love it and am totally in","Hello my Queen, would you possibly have any info on Chewbacca for me?","King! No not yet","What are you thinking for your first moves?","Chewbacca just told me they were on board with western triple","I want to secure nwy for sure, and am hoping that I could get bel?","If Chewbacca is on board with the western tripple he may be on with me having bel. And then after that you my queen and I would have to decide which tripple we want to stay with","Ok so Chewbacca is cool with me having bel","If you have no objections I will take bel in fall","Yes, sounds good to me","I am planning to move to Den and Ruh. Does that sound ok to you?","Absolutely my beautiful queen","As for Chewbacca, not much of a talker so hard to judge honestly","Yeah I can't super tell. They just said they were opening south, which they did","What are you thinking for fall orders?","Luke Skywalker seems sketchy, not sure if they are committed to the triple","See I've got the same inkling about Luke Skywalker being two-faced with us","Yeah, hopefully Luke Skywalker will focus on taking out R2-D2 and Han Solo. But who knows","So apparently Luke Skywalker has offered alliance to basically every nation lol","I am more than ever by your side my queen","Chewbacca is more promising for triple alliance","I will convoy my army to nwy if you bounce Luke Skywalker in Swe and we will be well on our way to eliminating him. \nNobody likes an alliance whore right","I agree, don't think we can trust Luke Skywalker and it seems like everyone else realizes that too at this point","Yes, those moves sound good to me!","What do you think we should do re: Chewbacca? he proposed bouncing over Munich","I think that's a clever idea","Keeps the other nations in the dark about our tripple alliance with him","Especially for Yoda","Sounds good. I'll let him know","Beautiful moves my Queen!! I'm in love \ud83d\ude0d","I propose we demilitarize any and all neighboring territories between Chewbacca, you and me. I will relay this same message to Chewbacca and if you're agreed to it relay it to Chewbacca as well and we have him relay it back to us. I wish we could have a 3-way chat with him.","I propose we demilitarize any and all neighboring territories between Chewbacca, you and me. I will relay this same message to Chewbacca and if you're agreed to it relay it to Chewbacca as well and we have him relay it back to us. I wish we could have a 3-way chat with him.","The demilitarization would basically consist of pic, bur, bel, hol and ruh. Oh and nth for me as well seeing as it is adjacent hol.","That being said I suggest we wait till fall  to act on it so as to keep our triple alliance under wraps for as long as possible. But I do like to operate on complete trust in order to more efficiently and effectively use our units in our respective theatres","I anticipate very much to hear your response :) \nI'm gonna finish building this little building and get me some much needed sleep and dream about your reply hehe.","Yes, that works for me. I'll relay to Chewbacca and get back to you. Let me know what you hear back from Chewbacca","Ok Chewbacca got back with me.  Said he's good with it too","Yes, he said the same to me. I think we should work towards taking out Luke Skywalker in scandinavia","I agree my queen. Sorry I've been very limited on time. How would you like to play it up in scandi?","This fall I could support you into Sweden while you cut bot support and I take stp","Then we'll be set to crush him in the mainland. I have my orders set for very strong positional gain to be ready for the fall. If you bounce swe again and move into bal we'll bet set for fall. Also ber is going to nth. I don't think I can get online again before resolution so cheers my queen. We'll catch up later","Sounds good to me! we will reconvene for fall","Hey Kaiserin I figured you would honor our DMZ treaty this year. What happened?","I am sorry! I took it to mean no action in those places and I thought I was already there when we agreed on the zones.  Please know it was only a misunderstanding \ud83d\ude03 I still have your back","Did Luke Skywalker confront you about the western triple? He\u2019s on to us","Yes he did lol.","Also how do you not know what demilitarization of an area means? Lol\nYou fairly new at the game or from another planet hehe?","See now you put me in a pickle :\/ that's why I confirmed with you that I was moving out of bel. I was expecting hol and ruh to be vacated as well.","Although you've given me no reason beyond that for distrust so I'm staying with you and trusting you my queen.  \nOn another note Luke Skywalker is kinda desperate and asking me to head towards Chewbacca lol. Even offered me support into Sweden","Are you there kaiserin?","Gah sorry, it really was just an honest brain lapse, I was entering moves last minute while occupied in real life. Thank you for giving me another chance to prove my support!!","Oh good you're online! :)","Yes, Luke Skywalker seems desperate. I think he got everyone against him from the very beginning. Yoda is definitely working to find an alliance against Chewbacca","Has he made you any offers on Sweden?","No specific offers yet, but they are definitely trying to scheme something.","I suppose it will be more Mediterranean based","Oh, no I was referring to Luke Skywalker","Like has he made you an offer on sweden?","Ohhh sorry. Was confused why Yoda would be taking about swe haha. No Luke Skywalker didn\u2019t offer anything","He just snarked about me ignoring him and his alliance, even though he was silent and uncooperative before","Ok good. Well could you attack his fleet to cut support so I can get into stp?","Yes","Awesome! Thank you my queen. Also we need to discuss how we're going to split Luke Skywalker. Han Solo will want a piece of him too","If I may ask, where are you from? Seems so hard to coordinate good time to talk","Sorry I left abruptly earlier- had to run out for some appointments. Can\u2019t diplomacy and drive \ud83d\ude09","I\u2019m on the east coast","PA?","Yes, I agree about figuring a plan to split up Luke Skywalker. R2-D2 is aiming for Luke Skywalker too, so we can probably use him along the way","Currently literally caught in the rain lol. I\u2019m all ears for what you have in mind re:Luke Skywalker. I\u2019ll follow up later tonight when I\u2019m back home!","Well I know this gonna sound a bit greedy right away but hear me out. If I get stp and you let me have Sweden you could have the rest of Luke Skywalker and I believe that to be better because it keeps us with more clear defined borders.","I like to operate on 100% trust and I feel like we got off to a slightly rocky start with the misunderstanding of the DMZ","But I'm open to your opinions and suggestions to my queen. This is a joint effort","Also to make sure we ARE on the same page this time, hol and ruh will be vacated this turn right? Chewbacca and myself already kept our end of the deal. I need your confirmation on this so I can vacate nth as well instead of having to cover bel","Yes, I will vacate hol and ruh. I understand how that made me appear to be flaky, but I can assure you that I'm devoted to this King\/Queenship. It will be corrected this season","As for Luke Skywalker, I think I can agree with your proposal, but first I'd like to understand a little more how to see Chewbacca working in all of this. Chewbacca was originally on board with this alliance, but has been less vocal, so its hard for me to gauge his commitment level","Right and based on the uncertainty we will have to act accordingly with him when the time comes","And thank you for confirming","As for right  now he keeps Yoda busy for us from which we both benefit","Oh hey you never got back with me whether you agree to the proposal on Sweden, stp for me and the rest of Luke Skywalker for you?","Sorry for the delay! Yes I can agree to that","No worries my dear. And thank you :)","I think after this turn we need to start making wedding plans lol","We could invite all the nations to attend and bear witness to the consummation of our commitment hahaha","You moved into Hol- Are you no longer in favor of a DMZ? Chewbacca and I upheld our end of the bargain this time around.","Yes you did in fact. Paranoia got the best of me :\/ with everybody getting getting so very suspicious about a western triple :(","Where do we go from here?","You're  willing to salvage this?","Potentially,  but I\u2019m worried that you and Chewbacca are trying to push me out of this triple","Your silence is troubling","I totally understand, my apologies I was busy working to put up the last wall on this cabin before  most of the guys here left","Hmm I put myself in a tough spot.","So how would you propose we move forward?","Hmmm","What do you think if you let me take Swe this round and then I promise to allow you a clear path\/support to take StP as we discussed before. That will throw everyone off the western triple suspicions, and we can move forward together. What do you say?","Hmm to much back tracking imo","What do you think would be a better option?","I'm super busy with work right now. Throw me another proposal.","You can focus on moving towards StP and I\u2019ll move towards Warsaw","Im up for other suggestions too if anything comes to mind. Hope work finishes up well!","Thank you, yes it came together nicely :)","Ugh I'm truly at a loss as to what to do :\/  I get along with you so very well with yet if I attack Luke Skywalker then Han Solo will be real  hard to stop will be a long term problem.","The other thing is I have only stp to gain from a war with Luke Skywalker.","Also Chewbacca seeing my moves was real quick to jump on the opportunity he sees for himself and wants Munich","I think really the only option I have other than continuing an invasion on you would be to attack Chewbacca","Ah I see your point(s)","Hmmm","IF you are in fact willing to salvage this \"thing\" we have hehe, invading Chewbacca is the only option I see.  Luke Skywalker poses no threat now and if Chewbacca gets attacked then Yoda is   free to put the brakes on Han Solo for us","Also what on earth is R2-D2 doing?  That's the other thing looks like Han Solo has R2-D2 in his pocket","Well obviously I\u2019d say to attack Chewbacca haha.  But more than that, I think that we work well together and can continue to do so. I am on board for a salvage! I haven\u2019t communicated as much with Chewbacca, and he seems to be doing his own thing heading into Yoda anyways. I think that R2-D2 is trying to support Yoda into Chewbacca? I think he wanted to work with Han Solo against Luke Skywalker, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what\u2019s actually transpiring","(Sorry if you got that multiple times due to me trying to send while bot went down)","I get that we work really well together. But honestly what good is that if it's to our detriment?","Im saying the 3 of us","I do know for certain that Chewbacca is moving to bur.\nI discouraged  the move but he was very set on it. Said that he doesn't need mar unit against Yoda anyway","Hmmm good to know. I believe that R2-D2 is supporting Ven into Pie, but nothing we can do about that at the moment","Yoda did say that they can get R2-D2 to cooperate  agaisnt R2-D2 so there's  that","Maybe let's you and me tell Yoda that we are ready to help them out if they can swing R2-D2 towards Han Solo?","Yes that sounds good","Okidoki","And to ease your heart a bit more this sesson I'll  let you in on a lil secret ;) I'm moving towards Chewbacca and away from you. I really do want us to work, paranoia just got the best of me last season and I know that's not a good thing for a good relationship. I will reward in kind","Why thank you \ud83d\ude42 I do appreciate it","Ok, I've told Yoda","Great!!  And one final thing\n\nTHANK YOU THANK YOU  for being such a strong  queen. That is a thing of beauty and worth","Ok well I'm off  to finish the roof. Have a good night ttyl","Is this my own fault?","What are you referring to?","Chewbacca's  moves","Hey are you available to chat real quick?","I won't have time tomorrow","If you don't have time rn. Could we at least bounce in holland?","Sorry for delay, I am traveling this weekend, haven\u2019t had much time online","My main priority now is getting another supply center before winter","Have you cut some deal with Luke Skywalker already for a sc?","I admit i made a hige blunder in an attempt to put the brakes on tirkwy. You can have holland back","Ok, thank you!","No I don\u2019t have any deals yet","Also I  had a question.  Did you and Chewbacca communicate  about bouncing  in bur?","We did a few seasons back, but decided against it. I was working on a hunch.","Hmmm. Wonder who warned Chewbacca","Im trying to hard","Take holland for real and I'm  gonna slow down and coast along for the ride","If Han Solo gets out of his corner so be it","Haha ok sounds good! I haven\u2019t heard from anyone else over the weekend, don\u2019t think much scheming has been going on","So Chewbacca just decides all on his own to \nSwing up for an attack on me? A bit odd i think","Honestly we only had talked about what he was doing with Yoda and R2-D2","I see","Hello my queen how was your weekend?","Hey! It was busy but good. How about yourself?","Also- thank you for letting me have Hol back! \ud83d\ude03 I really appreciate it","Very worky hehe","You're very welcome!! I think that's the least I could do after taking it out of stupid paranoia lol","Haha no need to worry","I think that was the last labor pain for the birth of our glorious alliance! ;)","But I'm glad you had a good weekend :)","How you want to move forward now?","Cheers to that!","I want to walk with you side by side","Hmmm i haven\u2019t thought about my next moves yet. I can\u2019t tell who Chewbacca is trying to work against. Seems like R2-D2 wants to cooperate to get Luke Skywalker knocked out, so I\u2019ll probably work with him in Central Europe a bit","Ok sure :). In the meantime I can deal with Chewbacca's uncertainty together with Yoda","What are you thinking?","Han Solo is doing his thing!!!","Oh cool, sounds good!","Yeah I was hoping Yoda could help out with Chewbacca more, seemed like they were still concerned with Han Solo though, last time we talked","Hmm board wise they look very concerned about Chewbacca and not so much Han Solo. They even supported Han Solo to a sc","That tripped me out when I saw it","Oh you\u2019re right. I guess I\u2019ll touch base with Yoda again about it","Yea that'd be good. From my perspective Yoda is way way to committed west.","Yeah.  I will keep you posted!","Very much appreciated","Sounds like Yoda is trying to capture Marseilles. I am considering trying to  bounce there with Chewbacca again in order to make that happen, not sure yet","Whether you bounce or not marseilles will fall because Yoda can cut Spain support with wes","Might be better if you could support bel>bur","Yeah good point","The potential problem I see with me supporting bel>bur is that Yoda has voiced concern about you, and if they see me too obviously on your side it might be hard for me to cooperate with Yoda","Lol I felt that coming. With the way they were so totally committed west","In that case we should probably leave Chewbacca alone to defend against Yoda","Yeah, I think that\u2019s best this season at least. I think we\u2019ll need Yoda\u2019s cooperation against Han Solo\/R2-D2 and don\u2019t want them to turn on us too soon","Ok sounds good.","So since we're not doing anything in Chewbacca, what you say we start pushing our armies east? We could hold bel and hol for this turn then in the fall bel>ruh to get ready for a jog through mun in spring and into boh or sil in the following fall","Also fyi I will need nth to be able to convoy pic unit to nwy.","Yeah let\u2019s focus east. I\u2019m not exactly sure what R2-D2 is going to do, so let\u2019s take this season to see and go from there","Cool, thanks for the heads up!","Question.  Are you into what Yoda is doingm","?","Idk, seems like they are only going after Chewbacca right now, which is just pushing Chewbacca up against us","I haven\u2019t coordinated with Yoda much, just trying to keep communication open. I think Yoda is open to cooperate with us against Chewbacca (obviously) and is trying to keep R2-D2 focused on Luke Skywalker\/Han Solo","I'm super busy with work right. I'll get with you soon as I can","Ok no worries!","Hey just give me a moveset to enter.  I don't have time to do any discussing :\/","We do need to push east for sure.  As much as possible","Ok nvm. Already put my orders in. I'm holding bel unless you want me to go to ruh to get that unit through mun in spring to help in the east to lock it down before Han Solo does","gah sorry I missed this earlier! Hope life gets less hectic","Holding bel sounds good to me","Would you be ok with me taking Swe so i can get another build this winter? Just thinking we will need more armies against the east. I'm amenable to another flip flop in the future \ud83d\ude42","Ok will do. I'm very sorry I haven't had much time for you","Yea I'm good with that. It is paramount to get armies east","I'm working on getting some in from the north","Awesome, thanks!","Anything for you my queen. Even up to half of my kingdom  ;) hehe","Likewise for you sir!","Do you know where I got that quote from? Lol","No... haha sorry. I am guessing it's from a movie?","Yep :) the movie of queen Esther","I may just call you my \"Queen Esther\" lol","Unless you're name is prettier than that?","I am \"Sir [redacted] the First\" ;)","Esther is a regal name, I like that","I haven't heard of that move though haha","Queen Esther it is ;)","Perfect \ud83d\ude03","Hey! Hope work is less busy today! Let me know what you're thinking this season. I'm going to push armies east","Well still going hard but I can take a min for you Ms. Queen Esther  :)","ok \ud83d\ude42 nothing very urgent","Basically my plan is just push east with you","Just wondering what you think we should do about Chewbacca in the next few seasons","Idk, what do you suggest?","He's pretty tied up with Yoda and Yoda is tied up with him","We could take him out or let him keep Yoda in check but then again we could use Yoda's help against Han Solo","Yeah I'm not sure if it's better to cooperate with Yoda and take out Chewbacca, or just let the two of them fight it out a little longer.  I just wanted to check if you'd make any agreements recently to Chewbacca","I haven't talked to him in a season or two","Just that I would ceasefire on our borders so he could focus on Yoda","Nothing beyond that","I'm inclined to just cooperate with Yoda and take him out. That would be one less loose end. If we do that then we would have Yoda's and R2-D2's help to eliminate Han Solo","Also in about one more year it will be time to start insinuating to Yoda and R2-D2  that we will betray each other after Han Solo is gone","Ok, good to know","Yes, I like both of those plans","I think it'll be fairly easy to take Chewbacca out at this point, and Yoda seems cooperative and its likely we could each get a supply center if we help","Would you support me into Moscow? And let me know if you need my support in Bur or anywhere","(and thanks again for Swe last winter, hopefully we can put some of these new armies to good use)","Frankly I was expecting to get Moscow since I gave you Sweden","I wouldn't mind sharing Chewbacca with you though","Besides I have 2 armies that I need to put to use in the east. I could get the far eastern fringe of Luke Skywalker and you would be getting most of R2-D2.","Ooo I don't want to count the chicks before they hatch but imaging an Obi-Wan Kenobi Han Solo?!!! R2-D2 for you Han Solo for me and we share the Balkans or something along those lines","About support to bur, let me see first if Chewbacca will reply and accept my offer to help him regain marseilles","Ok that seems fair. I know we had talked about you just having StP when we originally discussed Luke Skywalker. The only problem is that R2-D2 is really worried about you at the moment and doesn't want to cooperate or make moves against Han Solo when he sees you rolling down Luke Skywalker.","Yoda is spooking everybody about me :\/","So what does R2-D2 want me to do then? Stab you instead of going south to help against Han Solo?","And yes I hear you about our original discussion although we can both testify that a lot has happened since then lol. Always hard to project a concrete future you know","I think R2-D2 just wants everyone else to stay put except him haha","Let me ask you my Queen Esther, are you uncomfortable with me having units all around you?","I could understand such a feeling which is why I'm trying to keep as far away from your borders as possible while simultaneously keeping up with your growth.","\"Half of the Kingdom\" seems to be coming to fruition sooner than expected hahaha","Hah yes, I understand too. I suppose I'm feeling a bit undecided on how to deal with R2-D2 at the moment.","Tell you what. You take Moscow then and  I'll stay in the background like a lion ready to pounce at the right time. You get your leverage on R2-D2 with that and in return you help me get Paris and bre.","I'm moving into Pru to insinuate to R2-D2 that I'll be trying to move into StP, and hopefully that will be enough to keep him off my back another season or two","Oops we sent messages at the same time haha","Or I go to moscow this spring and you ask him to move to ukr to support you into Moscow in the fall.","The move to pru works with both plans","Hmm both good ideas. Though it seems unlikely that you wouldn't bounce in Moscow without my support, and if I support you, then the whole rue with R2-D2 is up","*ruse","I must admit, I've been in bed with Luke Skywalker too \ud83d\ude2c hehe. He told me himself he would help me get Moscow to keep Han Solo from getting it","Luke Skywalker was just a \"concubine\" tho lol","BETTER BE haha","Ok then, let's go with your second plan","My dear Esther! I put it on my Kingdom that concubine is all it was lol","All right second plan it is then","Well Han Solo is very VERY adamant about Moscow being rightfully his","He just tried to get my support into Moscow too, which I declined","Good","Thank you","What did he say to that?","I think he\u2019ll move into Ukr instead. So hopefully Han Solo and R2-D2 will at least bounce there?","Sweet. Did you tell him that you want Moscow?","No. He guessed that you and I had plans to split up Luke Skywalker, but i evaded that part of the convo haha","That's my queen!!!","Did you intend to hold everywhere?","Ah that sux!!! :\/ I was in a business meeting!","I absolutely did not intend to do that!!!","And Chewbacca moving on me?!?!? He explicitly said he was not moving against me this season","\ud83d\ude26","Mind if I get either Moscow or Sweden? I pretty much need a build in lvp to fight Chewbacca back","?","Hey! Sorry for the delay, was kind of checked out for the weekend haha. Yeah, happy to give back Swe. Would you be ok supporting me into Moscow?","Thought R2-D2 was supporting you? Han Solo gave up on getting Moscow","But yes I can support you","Yeah I thought so too, but he hasn\u2019t responded all weekend....so thank you! I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s just offline. I can keep you posted though","Could you please support ruh>bel?","I am completely putting my Kingdom in your hands this season lol.","Support entered!","Thank you Queen Esther.","Of course, King","Ok R2-D2 got back to me and is supporting me into Moscow, so don\u2019t worry about it!","In that case should go to Moscow as well to show conflict to the other nations?","Yeah good idea","Really is to bad that I missed my moves last season.  That would've been awesome ammunition to use against them hehe","Yeah oh well...I still think we are in good shape for the time being!","Yea you're right. The Sweden move will also help","I will definitely look the the bad guy this season \ud83d\udc7a","Hahah here he comes","R2-D2 will be excited and happy \ud83d\ude05","Oh boy. Yoda too \ud83d\ude02","True that!","Have you heard anything from Chewbacca?","He claims he has no interest in fighting me.  I'm like what's with the Belgium disaster?  Haha","He only mentioned that you wanted Bur, that\u2019s all though. That was last Friday","I see.  Quite the trickster","Did you even talk about that with him?","Only asked him if he'd like for me to go help him get mar back","When he declined the offer I said ok","Ahhhh gotcha","Maybe your lack of action this season will cause him to back off\/head back for Yoda","*last season","Hopefully","Apologies my queen I had completely discarded the idea that Luke Skywalker might add the support again since he was radio silent","Glad you got vie at least!!","That\u2019s ok! I\u2019ll def need your support to Moscow now since R2-D2 is mad at me \ud83d\ude02","Raging mad or just mad? Haha","At least passive-aggressive mad haha","They want to still work with you I imagine?","Doesn\u2019t seem like it :\/","At least they locked horns with the Han Solo now!","I'll dedicate my unit in stp to help you in whatever way you need in the east and in turn could you dedicate one unit to help me smash out this Chewbacca nuisance?","Also I did not expect that move into vie so I appreciate my queen being willing to be the \"bad\" guy along with me haha","Thank you! And yes.\n\nVie was a last minute decision...maybe should have waiting longer to break non aggression with R2-D2 but he made it too tempting","*should have waited","Perhaps. But I think you will be fine. With my unit to help you","Yes I think so too","Hmm just noticed something tho. If  I get you into mos that would block my unit off from being able to help. Think we may have to swap again?","Swap where?","Just want to make sure I understand what you\u2019re thinking","Like swap Moscow for swe. That way I can use my unit in the east to help you","Ok gotcha. Works for me. I'll move my fleet back to Swe and let you have Mos","Cool deal","Chewbacca wants me to suggest something for him. Any ideas?","Leave Bre behind hahaha","Hmm","Do you want to leave him alone this season or no?","Not necessarily but I could to have him go south","Do you think he\u2019s going to actually do what you suggest?","Not really. But he might since I have him pinned","Yeah fingers crossed. I guess if he goes south, it would get you easier access, even in a season or two","What if I openly make plans with him to stab you if he goes south?","That might work. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s particularly worried about me or not","Ok I'll see what happens and keep you posted","Cool, thank you","My regal Queen, are you online?","Yes, briefly. I have to get in the car to drive home soon. What\u2019s up?","So Chewbacca will move to ruh and bur","With 100% trust we can pull off a super cool moveset this year","Ok, what are you thinking?","We let Chewbacca go into ruh in Hopes of getting mun and I force into hol with support and you retreat into kiel. In the fall I move back out of hol and towards Chewbacca while you support mun with kiel to deny Chewbacca","Of course only if you are on board","I do trust you to follow through with the moves- but seems like I still end up losing Hol (at least for next winter). Is the goal just to keep Chewbacca occupied so you can get into Chewbacca from the other side?","I have to drive now- will be back online as soon as I can!","No my Queen I  will be leaving hol in the fall","But I\u2019ll need the Kie unit to support Mun I think \ud83e\udd14","Precisely. Hence the reason of me moving out of hol on my own in the fall","Ah! Gotcha.  Ok let\u2019s go for it! I\u2019m in","Cool deal. Setting my orders as such","Also could you wait to move into swe until the fall?","Yeah, guess that\u2019ll make the whole thing look less planned to everyone else. You\u2019re either a genius or an evil genius hah","Lol you choose ;)","And yes the idea was to not let the other nations catch on to what we're doing","Still all good to go with the plan?","Absolutely my queen!","Perfect!","What's it lookin like for you in Vienna?","Can you support hold my unit in Moscow?","Actually nvm that. Luke Skywalker is defending mos","Oh that\u2019s good. R2-D2 is definitely after Vie, but I can\u2019t tell if Yoda will support them there (so R2-D2 could try to get Han Solos support into War) or if he\u2019ll use both Gal and Bud for Vie","I get the impression that R2-D2 and Han Solo have worked together and against each other off and on, so it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on","Woooooo *high five*","High five back ;)","Were you holding your breath my dear? Hehe","Maybe a bit haha. It\u2019s all good now \ud83d\ude42","Hehe, I totally understand","My queen, I hope you had a great weekend","Could you do me a favor and bounce with me in nth? Also I propose that we eliminate Chewbacca R2-D2 and Han Solo and draw with Yoda","I'm getting bored and the only way left to spice things up would be to stab you which I'll kill myself before doing. So let's wrap this burrito up. Whatcha say?","Hey again! Hope you had a good weekend too. Yeah I can bounce you in Nth. I\u2019m cool with the plan to draw with Yoda. Seems like R2-D2 and Chewbacca will be done with easily, hopefully Han Solo too","Awesome! Thank you very much :)\nAnd yes I had a splendid weekend which I topped off with taking my little family kayaking yesterday  ;)","Fun! I went kayaking last weekend actually, good choice","In a river or lake? Both are fun depending if you want chill and relax or fast and adventurous :)","Also I need your support in bel please","River!","And will do","Thank you much my dear!!","No problem!","Yoda asked about you, so I told them about plans to three-way tie. They are on board!","Wanna hop into Nth in preparation of a sexy convoy into Syria from Edinburgh?","Oh man. Yeah I can do that","Awesome!!","This game WILL be interesting yet haha","To my Dear and Loyal Queen Esther. \nRespectfully from yours truly:  (I, King Shetan personally write this note \"Esther First Queen of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ruler of the Darth Vaders.\") I hereby request  that my beautiful foreign Queens would lovingly allow their benevolent \"King Shetan The 1st\" to close out his empire at 12 scs and in Kingly fashion  generously bequeathing 11 scs to each Queen. (Not sure if that ends with a question mark or an exclamation point haha) whew. I'm glad I'm not actually a king. Would be exhausting to always \"try\" to speak with eloquent fluidity","The edit is my attempt at doing justice to \"Her Majesty\"","Are you ok?","Sorry for the delayed response- yes! I appreciate the formal message haha. I\u2019m in agreement; looking forward to getting Chewbacca, R2-D2, and Han Solo out of our way and wrapping this thing up!","Haha glad you liked it ;) and thank you","Do you have any ideas about  how to handle Han Solo? I\u2019d like to get into Ukr to start making that push but I\u2019m trying to think of a strategy where Han Solo doesn\u2019t end up in Moscow \ud83e\udd14","Also Yoda wants to discuss how we\u2019ll split up the rest of the board. I wish we could all just have a three way convo at this point haha","I'll support hold Moscow and moscow will support you to ukr. Also I'll ask the if we can get a  group chat for us","Ok thanks! I doubt we\u2019ll be allowed because of the study but worth asking","Am I supporting war or gal into ukr?","Gal","Thanks for checking!!","Ok got it","Yea I'm glad I did lol cuz I first set it for war","Yeah sorry I didn\u2019t specify before. I guess you can\u2019t read my mind \ud83d\ude06","Yea sadly there's limits to our connection :\/ hehe","Can you please support Ukr - Sev?","Already done my Queen","Danke","Anything for you my Esther ;)","Whenever you got a minute let me know","Hey I\u2019m on line now","Oh hi :)","So I have an idea that involve yours truly and this 2 Queens coordinating in perfect harmony to bring the fantasy to fruition. Figured what better way to consummate the marriage of this 3-way union right ;)","It involves 2 of your fleets 3 of mine and 4 of Her Majesty Queen Bianca De Medici.","Hahah what\u2019s the idea? Yoda and I were going to coordinate to get me into Ank, and then you can take Bre and wrap things up. Sounds like we only have two more moves","This spring turn I would put a fleet in NAO and NTH while you move NTH into NRG and SWE into SKA. My army in nwy goes to swe and in the fall turn it convoys across a body of 9 fleets all the way around the world into Syria!!!!","Oh wow I guess we could do that...let me know if Yoda is on board too. We can check with the admin, but it seems like the game is ending winter 1910? In which case your army in Syria won\u2019t be doing anything. But I guess this might be a once in a lifetime chance haha","Keep me posted on what Yoda says!","Yea she's on board","Cool cool","Let\u2019s do it","Exciting!! My moves are already in","Wooo going to be a party!","Yes ma'am!! Finish this with an epic bang!! A new big bang theory  haha","drumroll for the epic convoy",":)","How\u2019s it down in the Middle East?? \n\nI set it to 3 way draw for the final season","Mine is set to 3 way draw as

{"messages":["Hi Darth Vader--it seems our paths are finally crossing! \nI'm guessing Obi-Wan Kenobi has made plans with you for the two of you to take over Luke Skywalker. Especially if you help Obi-Wan Kenobi into Moscow, I can't help but notice that Obi-Wan Kenobi's territory is starting to...surround yours. That doesn't make for a good partnership. I, on the other hand, would pose little threat to you in Moscow and could help keep Obi-Wan Kenobi at bay in the North\/Baltic. \nI'm open to negotiation if you are!","Hey Han Solo, nice to finally meet you! I\u2019m definitely open to negotiation. The problem at the moment is that it seems like Luke Skywalker is going to support Obi-Wan Kenobi into Moscow. So even if I support you, you\u2019d bounce and I can\u2019t afford to have Obi-Wan Kenobi after me just for that","I\u2019m not sure what your relationship with R2-D2 has been so far. He\u2019s been cooperative with me. However, he seemed so single minded about getting rid of Luke Skywalker...I can\u2019t tell what he wants to do next","R2-D2 and I have been working together solely on taking down Luke Skywalker, so I'm not sure of their long term plans either...and I haven't heard from A since winter.\n\nI understand about not supporting me into Moscow, and I appreciate the tip about Luke Skywalker. Could I perhaps just get an agreement from you not to block me moving to Ukraine?","Ok, that\u2019s what it seemed like. I can agree to that!","Are you still interested in Moscow?","oh yes. Why do you ask?","...If there's any chance you could cut support from Livonia, it'd be greatly appreciated!","Gah never mind, I was thinking about proposing as such but I think I\u2019ll need the units elsewhere. Let\u2019s stay in touch though- let me know if you\u2019re ever open to coordinating to control the growth of R2-D2 and\/or Obi-Wan Kenobi in the east","I am open to both of those! I already have plans to curb R2-D2 in the Balkans so if there\u2019s anything i can do to help you with the same in the north just met me know","Glad you and Yoda were able to put a dent into R2-D2!","Thanks! We're gonna keep working on it. What are your plans for eastern Europe these days?","I\u2019m not sure yet, I think I\u2019ll wait to see where R2-D2 disbands","Any chance you'd support me into Moscow this year?","Barring that, I do think it's worth collaborating in the future to keep Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi in check, don't you agree?","I can\u2019t support you into Moscow this season, but I do agree about coordinating against Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi. It seems like R2-D2 is solely focused on slowing down Yoda at this point. I suspect you could get Rum this season?","So. Aaaaany chance you're ready to help me stand up to Obi-Wan Kenobi? If nothing else, I think it'd be a good way for us to build up trust so that we can take on the rising Yoda threat once R2-D2's dealt with.","I can\u2019t this turn but I definitely want to work together. Maybe next season we can have a deal- something like if you support me into Bud, I\u2019ll support you into Serbia?","I was thinking the same thing. \nCould you reassure me a bit by telling me what you\u2019re stationed in Galicia for and how long you plan to be there?","Awesome. I\u2019m using it for support into Vie this season, hopefully into Bud next season. What are your plans this season\/do you think you\u2019ll be able to get into Yoda\u2019s territory anywhere?","I'm considering moving into the aegean and pressing into greece, but nothing definite yet"],"sender_labels":[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true],"receiver_labels":[true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false],"speakers":["Han Solo","Darth Vader","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo"],"receivers":["Darth Vader","Han Solo","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader","Han Solo","Darth Vader"],"absolute_message_index":[1258,1260,1264,1265,1266,1527,1528,1534,1547,1550,1594,1597,1599,1628,1629,1641,1790,1811,1812,1813,1814],"relative_message_index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20],"seasons":["Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Spring","Spring","Spring","Winter","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring"],"years":["1905","1905","1905","1905","1905","1906","1906","1906","1906","1906","1906","1906","1906","1907","1907","1907","1907","1908","1908","1908","1908"],"game_score":["5","7","7","5","7","7","4","4","7","4","7","4","7","4","4","7","6","7","6","7","6"],"game_score_delta":["-2","2","2","-2","2","3","-3","-3","3","-3","3","-3","3","-3","-3","3","-1","1","-1","1","-1"],"players":["Darth Vader","Han Solo"],"game_id":3}

He did offer to walk his army through Burgundy, which I thought was special","Hah how generous","You want to coordinate Bel\/Hol, or are you still trying to remain neutral?","Ugh idk. I might have to remain neutral there another season, I can\u2019t afford Obi-Wan Kenobi coming after me from the north or east (and he\u2019s agreed to stop at Moscow for now).

I'm willing to put myself in a dangerous spot for a bit if we can make serious moves on Luke Skywalker. If Luke Skywalker moves in then it should expose their west side to you.","Well, so depending on if I can get Yoda to support me into Bul, I'd have you move to Rum this turn. \n\nWhat do you mean 'moves in'?","If Luke Skywalker moves their gal army into Vie","Okay yes. I agree that wouldn't be a big problem for you because it leaves Luke Skywalker vulnerable to me and because you could pretty easily just take vienna back (provided Munich isn't an issue...)","Yoda confirmed that they'd support me into Bul, so I'll support Ser into Rum this turn unless I hear otherwise?","Yeah. Currently in a non-aggression with Darth Vader, assuming that holds I think we can make a good push against Luke Skywalker. I'm on my phone doing this so I have to constantly tab back and forth between discord and backstabber that's why this is a bit confusing.","Support into rum is greatly appreciated.","ah yeah that's a pain. And happy to do it! And I hope you and Yoda can coordinate as well, although I know that means more tabbing for you...","I'm surviving. I think we're coordinated as best as we can for now.","So if you're not doing a bounce in Vienna, would Bud be free to poke Gal?","Yes, I suppose I could do that","Worst case for you would still be that Gal moves to Vienna. I was suggesting it incase Luke Skywalker decides to use Gal and Ukr to support Bul into Rum. But if you think that's unlikely then it's probably not worth the risk","May be better to just have Bud support Ser-Rum for some extra security","Rum is guaranteed for you this year--which will set us up nicely to start surrounding Warsaw\/Moscow","Are you still with me to invade Luke Skywalker? I could use your support for Sev-Ukr.","yeah","Great! And I assume you\u2019ll also push into Galicia?","yeah","Are you hearing anything from Darth Vader?","Broadly speaking, if you arrange with Darth Vader to support them into Warsaw, I'll help you take Warsaw for yourself once I'm able to do so, if you want me to.","just sort of normal truce then deal with Obi-Wan Kenobi after Luke Skywalker is gone","So what do you think is the best course of action for us this season?","Well Luke Skywalker is going to lose either Stp or Mos so you can try to move into Mos hoping they move back. Or one of can support the other into Ukr. Im trying to get Darth Vader to support me into War and told them I would help them take Stp once Luke Skywalker was gone and Obi-Wan Kenobi was the threat","Thanks for the info! I think trying for Ukraine again makes more sense, if you\u2019re willing to support me in.","that works for me. I'll support with Rum.","Would you like support into Ukraine, the better to take Warsaw?","I'd still like to collaborate with you, and I'd like to help you however I can (provided, of course, you're okay with me having Moscow).","Alright, I'm getting the vibe that you *don't* want to try and work things out with me?","I know that I attacked you just a season ago, but Darth Vader has betrayed me after I helped them. Being in the middle I see this as me being about to get caught up in a whole mess, and I'd really like to go after the person who made moves into my home territory. If you want to attack Mos next spring I'll support you from the Ukr.","The two of us are not enough to hold it against Darth Vader\/Obi-Wan Kenobi, so your offer--unlike your betrayal of me--is empty.","in my defense, the plan to take you out was only delayed not stopped.","not exactly a betrayal","Look, I'm sorry I snapped. If you'd be willing to back off me and return Bul, I'd be happy to help you against Darth Vader or at the very least not antagonize you while you fight them","You can have Ukr back to start. I need to reposition before I can just hand off Bul. Hope you understand.","Okay, I\u2019ll take Ukraine this turn then. Thank you!","Is Yoda helping you retake Vienna?","either than or giving me an extra serving of betrayal","ah that's always the question isn't it. I'm wondering if I'm under any threat from the two of you in Constantinople...last I spoke with Yoda, Yoda's units had come over here on the promise of you two destroying me. It kiiinda looks like that's still the case.","Well Yoda has told me that as well, but then again Darth Vader also told me we had a non-aggression and here we are. I believe this turn we'll see if Yoda is going for you or me. I'm taking back Vienna from Darth Vader and thats my plan for now.","I really wish I could believe that was *all* you were planning","Until i have stability that's all I'm doing","Looks like I got betrayed big time. I'm thinking of going after Yoda primarily because they were my first ally and their betrayal hurts the most. Once I'm back at my comp I'll have a better idea of how I'm proceeding.","if you decide to not work with Yoda, I can push them back then you can freely take my territory. Self preservation is out the door, I just don't want Yoda or Darth Vader to gain anything from their betrayal.","I think it's a little premature for you to entirely throw out self preservation. I'll think it over.","The walls are closing in. I'm not going out without payback.","any thoughts on the matter?","whatever im proceeding as if you're with m","disbanding Gal, i'll support you full into Bul the from there on out we can push Yoda out of my territory until my inevitable demise.","Hey sorry for the delay in getting back to you\u2014Yoda has promised me Bul but I appreciate your support in case they are lying","well they betrayed me so your betrayal is just around the corner.","I want to see the streets run red with their Ragu and break their spaghetti bones.","I think that seems likely. \nAnd revenge sure brings out your poetic side! \n...you know that\u2019s kind of how I felt about you when you stabbed me after working with me for several turns.","Once again, never stabbed you. We never had an agreement for anything other than non-aggression until Luke Skywalker was dealt with.","Well you aggressed and Luke Skywalker was not dealt with","Believe me or not, but I held out on attacking you as long as a I could and i think that's why Yoda turned on me.","I aggressed to keep Yoda off of me for all the good it did.","Any chance you think Darth Vader would turn to your cause?","They have more manpower to take down Yoda than I do","I'm asking them if they want to help.","Darth Vader said they're in, but sounds reluctant to attack directly. So I'm not sure if they're actually committed to anything or if its just another ruse.","What's the word bird?","Sorry for the delay\u2014tell me how I can help. Is there any chance you\u2019d willingly let me into rum this season?","Think of it as you helping yourself really. If you support my push from Rum into Bul you can just move in and take Rum in the same turn, then we can do the same maneuver next season to greece hopefully.","Not sure how you feel about Darth Vader, but I think they're still working with Yoda. I asked them for some help and they gave excuses so I'm expecting them to move from the North on me this sesason. If they don't it will be a pleasant surprise. Just a heads up for what's coming though.","For clarification. You support Rum into Bul, and move either Ukr or Sev into Rum. Next season you support Bul into Gre and move something else into Bul. You get Yoda out of your hair and stick it back to them. If Darth Vader actually helps then I continue to push and you follow my units, if they don't then I hold off and you take my territory. Noble last stand and all that noise.","Okay thanks for clarifying. I just placed the order","I support you from Rum into Bud and you support from Bul into Gre? Then you move into next round to prevent Yoda from gaining units?","Also open to suggestions, just realized that right now there isn't a lot that stops Yoda from getting production.","I don\u2019t have a unit that can reach greece to support you there?","Just noticed that as well.","I think you should try for serbia into tripoli because Yoda confirmed that they\u2019re attacking serbia with albania","Okay, then do you want to support Bul into Ser and you can move Con into Bul if you choose?","I\u2019m a little hesitant to piss off Yoda, to be honest.","They were pretty upset about last season and I only just barely smoothed it over","Well, you can either piss them off and have them attack you or you can be nice and have them attack you. Only one of them ends with you gaining something out of it.","That\u2019s...a very good point","\"I'm obviously fairly heavily committed to my attack on you at the moment, but I do consider Han Solo's shenanigans around Bulgaria a breach so before I forgive and forget I thought I'd offer you a chance to negotiate.\"","Yeah seems like it was really smoothed over.","Ah, okay.\n...So what did you say to Yoda?","\"at least when my people die they'll die knowing they honored their alliance. Have fun under the boots of Obi-Wan Kenobi.\"","That\u2019s pretty good.\nAlright, i\u2019m moving into bul and I\u2019ll support you into ser","Word, I'll put the moves in.","I think I'm going to disband at Vie, I can use my other two units to support you into Ser or support with one at Gre and one at Bud.","I think it'd help me more if you dissolve Albania, and hit Ser and Bud to cut support so that Yoda can't take Rum or Bul. \n\nI really will support you into Bud this spring if you want; I'm sorry I didn't follow through on support for you last night but at like 11:30 when I finalized my orders I ultimately decided I'd need another fleet (and therefore a guaranteed build in Bul) to protect from Yoda.","Word, I'm boarding a flight now so I wont be able to place orders until later. Not really sure that support would stop me from dying anyway so I'm pretty indifferent as long as Yoda loses.","I know it's late notice, but could you poke greece to cut support of Bul?","Sorry for not responding or doing anything.

{"messages":["So, I'm proposing a northern triple. You, me, and Darth Vader roll down the rest of the board, and then call a three-way draw. It's a good route, because it's a pretty stealthy alliance early on. It looks like an EG taking on Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker just acting normally. How does that sound to you?","I would hop on board with that if Darth Vader does","I'll let you know what I hear from Darth Vader.","Ok sounds good. I'll be upfront with you, I had already proposed a western triple but neither have replied so if Darth Vader replies to the northern triple first then Chewbacca can die hehehehe *laughs evily*","Any word from the Darth Vaders yet? I have reason to believe he is already communicating with the Yodas and doesn't reply to me","I haven't gotten anything from anyone but you.","Apparently our alliance is self-establishing lol","I've now heard a bit from Yoda, but nought from Darth Vader.","A triple alliance with Yoda is sounding a bit better in this situation wouldn't you say?","I'd be quite on board with that as well, it wouldn't really change my opening moves","True that","So about Scandinavia.  Sweden for you and Norway for me I'm guessing?","That's the traditional way to do it, as long as Darth Vader doesn't get dickish.","If he does that just solidifies my suspicions","So, army, huh?","Uh, yea.  Classic opening. Besides we wouldn't want Chewbacca to get suspicious","Wish you had mentioned something if you were going to be uncomfortable with it. My spring moves were regular old classic as well","Last thing we need is for the rest of the map to get suspicious of the north triplets","Silence is uncertainty and uncertainty is hard to work with man","Sorry about that, crazy last few days for me. I'm gonna build an army in StP to keep up appearances, but I'm still board with the northern triad.","What appearances might those be? You already attacked Han Solo","And \"gonna build\" is future tense. I already see what you built so that text being out of context strikes me weird","Right, yes, sorry, I brainfarted, I'm playing Luke Skywalker in another game, and also doing a northern triad there, and that game is slightly behind this one in years. Got the games mixed up in my head.","It's a hassle and a half sorting them out sometimes.","That is a brainfart for sure lol","Anyway, having reoriented myself, I'm not going to do anything with StP (I've got a hold order in), and I'll move it out of StP once I see you're not coming my way. I figure it's not a big long-term loss or anything, because it's pretty quick to get it back down south.","Ok I  look forward to seeing it","I don't have time to chat unfortunately so we'll catch up next season","I'll be honest tho, you've given off a very sketchy vibe from the get go  so I will be establishing a strong base in Scandinavia. When\/if I see stp move south indicating  you're true intentions I can then begin to ease up on our borders. Thank you for understanding and I hope you have a good night or good day hehe whichever corresponds to you","I mean, I certainly understand what you're thinking here, but, if you start moving more into Scandinavia, that's going to be a problem and a big imminent threat to me. I'd much rather see a status quo here, where neither of us makes an approach against the other.","Let's see that hold order and then we'll talk again","Good morning sir.  I did have just a couple mins to get on.  Just want to give you a heads up that I will attack stp with nwy. Since your issuing a hold order nothing will come of it other than keeping up much needed appearances as you said.","Good to know.","I like keeping things above board","So, you decided to opt for a Western triple instead of a Northern?","Yea I wasn't left with much of a choice","I left you with plenty of choice, and you've got plenty of fleets to go after Chewbacca.","I would've loved to  try the northern but our stars just didn't align","Not the way the diplomacy worked out i didn't have much choice. The uncertainty was to overwhelming","Hey, I'm here, I'm talking, it's not too late to turn around. NAO is right there, the Channel is right there...","Man I hear you but at this point I need to at least grab stp wouldn't you say?","It wouldn't be fair  if I didn't","I don't think you do. Plenty of stuff you can do without it. You want Sweden? I could support you into Sweden.","You still there bro?","Yep.","Sorry I fell asleep on you lol","I'll take you up on your offer for Sweden man","Problem is to do that you wouldn't be able to defend stp and you'd be going out on a limb that I'm not sure you are willing to lol. Quite the pickle","?","I fell asleep on you, in turn! I'm not good at sleep schedules. Yeah, I'm going out on a limb, but I want us to work together.","Ugh this decision is harder for me than for you apparently lol","Weird how I've put myself in a position that you could be the one to betray me lmao","Question: has Darth Vader been in contact with you?","Nope. I've reached out, but no response.","Yea very quiet on my end as well. It's hard to work with silence","Why were you so sketchy at the beginning?","Like apparently offering everybody alliance and such","I feel like you're only wanting to work with me now cuz you're squeezed.","Do you truly want to be my ally?","Well I've found that with Luke Skywalker, the goal is to piss off as few people as possible, because if a bunch of powers are annoyed at Luke Skywalker, you won't last long. As for right now, yes, I absolutely do want to be your ally, because I think Luke Skywalker\/Obi-Wan Kenobi is a very strong long-term alliance.","You've got a lot of really easy paths to expansion that don't go through me, and I've got a lot of paths to expansion that don't go through you. Plus, you've got a friendship going with Chewbacca, and there's a Darth Vader right between us that we can definitely handle together, to our mutual long-term benefit.","Hmm guess you went to hard trying to be friendly and it backfired badly. From what I hear ALL your neighbors are gunning for you which would make me the target also if I do side with you :\/ but now you seem so cool","Yea I hear you on all of that. Believe me I'm aware of the board state","I'll get back with you on a for certain about Sweden. I trust my word means something to you by now","It does.","Very good. I just need to make sure I know EXACTLY what Darth Vader is doing this turn","I will let you know whether I'm with you or against you","Thanks.","Yes sir. It's been a business doing pleasure with you ;)","Aight man we are brothers in arms!!","I'm ready to rock and roll with you","You've got the support order. I'm leaving it to you to not get greedy.","You got it man.","Hey bru got a second?","What's up?","That wouldn't be the greatest thing. I want them in the dark so how bout you don't support me to Sweden and instead defend stp. My diplomacy with Darth Vader worked to where I can just walk into Sweden.","I was thinking about how they gonna know we allied if you support me","Fair enough. I'll put the support order in.","I'm thinking straight here right?","Yeah, you're on point.","Aight bet.","Oooo I like your lingo! \n\"You're on point\" that's my style lol","Where you from my g?","Lifelong born-and-raised New Yorker.","No shit. I got a friend vacationing in new York right now","I want to be there one year when the ball drops!!!","-applauds- Nice stab, my man. Nice stab.","Yea the diplomacy worked out super well","Tks btw hehe","Mornin brotha. How goes it?","Curious, was R2-D2 moving into tyr your doing?","It was not, R2-D2 hasn't been talking to me.","So, what I'm thinking I'm gonna do is, I'll sent my BOT fleet into StP, and my StP army down into Mos to deal with the Turk. Does that sound all good to you, or is there something you'd rather the BOT fleet help you with?","I mean would be cool if you could keep it in bot to cut bal support.  My nwy fleet is moving to ska so you can safely utilize stp down south. We can dmz stp and nwy. Well nwy is already going to be DMZ because of what I'm doing","Sure, I'll tap BAL.","Actually for the spring turn it would be better to support swe.","Gotcha. Order updatee.","Er, updated.","Thank you sir","How would you like some help against that gobbling Han Solo?","I'm trying to get R2-D2 back on board but he's just not responding.","The pope said they have good diplomatic  influence  with R2-D2 so if I move on Chewbacca they will be happy to help put the plug on Han Solo","So do I have your defensive support on Sweden this turn?","Sure thing!","Thank you sir","I think I  may be in the same boat as you lol","Then we'll shove this boat up everyone else's asses, eh?","Hahaha I like that idea!!","Well shit bru,  I have tried everything I can think to change the board stacked against you to no avail","At least I won't have to suffer for very long, I guess.","True","I'm gonna move swe to finland to back you up or at least to not let Han Solo and R2-D2 get stp","I'm sure you'd rather stp be Obi-Wan Kenobi than freaking Han Solo","100%. It's yours, and I'll try and get you Moscow too.","That would be sweet actually my brother. If I can get a strong footing in the east I can battle Han Solo back (I think)  lol","Still same plan?","Are you gone my friend?","I am so sorry!!

What's in it for me?","Rumania? I'll support you in.","If you want me to have Rumania (and presumably you don't want to take any of my holdings), what use is it to be in the Black sea anyway?","I'm imagining your being in Rumania as a short-term trust-building sort of thing. You're in there for a year, maybe two tops, and you get builds from that that allow you to build more fleets to flood the Med, and I get the long-term comfort of not worrying about you going to BLA.

If so, what have you told them?","Told R2-D2 I was gonna be working with them to dig you out, was lying through my teeth.","well how can I be sure you aren't lying to me, rather than them?

And so completely committed? Js","Lol good. It's better for me if you don't believe me in this","GO Chewbacca. Chewbacca is the man!","So this implies a triple alliance of Chewbacca, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi then? Because Chewbacca wouldn\u2019t do this without Darth Vader\u2019s word, and *you\u2019re* taking credit for Chewbacca!","No you're right.

Unfortunately she don't talk much.  Guess she'll have to open her mouth if she don't wanna miss out","Are you and Darth Vader are still on good terms? I'm really surprised you ended up in Sweden","We're sorting things out. Or trying to. They had broken a dmz treaty the first  year so forced my hand a bit. But we'll see what comes of it.","So do I take it you've lost interest in invading Luke Skywalker for the time being?","Yea well catching wind of Chewbacca's  betrayal took the wind out of me lol.

You're full of surprises! So, are you and Yoda collaborating to take down Chewbacca?","Honestly I feel like I no longer no what's going on lol","But yes I  think that's the plan.  If Yoda doesn't have death in mind for me","Hey man you online?","What are we doing about Moscow? \nMust admit I want it","Well if you try to take it I must admit i\u2019ll be...difficult","I'd like to come to some sort of understanding about it","What level of difficult are we talking and in what way?","Understand this: I've been hammering away at Luke Skywalker while you've been running around in the west and the Atlantic. I will do everything I can to make Moscow mine.","Yea I suck at playing hard ball so do what you feel you deserve. And yes you're right. You've been hammering away at Luke Skywalker and with R2-D2's help been very successful.","I'll give you that for sure","Well fyi I'm going for Moscow so do with that as you see fit","Oh wow I'm rereading our messages this morning (good morning btw) and wow do I sound horrible!! Long and hard day at work trying to unite my fellow contractors and stop bitchiness amongst us, seems to have leaked into here :\/ I'm sorry","Also kinda got on my high horse with what you said about me but you're totally right I've just been kinda gallivanting around aimlessly. I do have a lot to learn, it's not like I do in depth studies on how to play DIPLOMACY or anything I just like to make a party out of it and have a good time lol. But I can see I can learn from you. Again sorry about how nasty I sounded","That\u2019s alright I prefer honest nastiness to dishonest courtesy","Haha very true!","Which makes honest courtesy the ideal world in which case I would ask that you consider making an exception with Moscow for me as that would keep our borders very simple","Our borders are simple now. You have countless avenues for expansion. Chewbacca, for instance.","I take it you have already made a deal with Darth Vader and R2-D2 for mos?","I've made arrangements that factor in Luke Skywalker working with you, but I'm not going to say more.","Hmm that's interesting","Clearly don't need your snark right now, Obi-Wan Kenobi! I figure there's no sense fighting you over Moscow now that I've got other things to deal with, so it's yours next season as far as I'm concerned.","Ok thank you. And seems you won't have to take anymore of my snark for a good long while as I obviously have my own problems to deal with now too.","Eh, you were stretching yourself too thin trying to get a foothold in Chewbacca *and* Luke Skywalker, I think.

{"messages":["Care for a western triple with Darth Vader? Ive long wanted to try this","I love triples, myself.  Especially when I'm not Darth Vader","Hi president, apologies for the late reply, i worked ALL NIGHT LONG till 5 a.m. and yielded myseld only 2 hrs of sleep then it was back to work \ud83d\ude31 just barely now taking a lunch break","Glad to hear you'd like the triple. \nGuess this means you launch off the Iberian peninsula towards Yoda and let me have bel?","That could work - just coordinate with the Darth Vader.","Ok thank you Mr. President. \nMuch obliged","Very nice very nice! This is a promising alliance :)","I propose we demilitarize any and all neighboring territories between Chewbacca, you and me. I will relay this same message to Chewbacca and if you're agreed to it relay it to Chewbacca as well and we have him relay it back to us. I wish we could have a 3-way chat with him.","I sent that to Darth Vader and copied and pasted to you for the sake of keeping it exactly the same. Let us know what you think please. Again a pleasure doing business with you Mr. President I look forward to our future","We're all good. And I'm thinking if you don't object I build f Brest, army Marseille - fleets are headed to the med anyway, it's just as far that way, and gives Yoda less heads up","Yes i'm good with that","Did Darth Vader message you about the dmz?","I don't think so, lemme check messages","Yep, he did. I'm good with it.","Good deal! Man I wish we had a 3-way chat! Would make being on the same page so much easier","Hey brother have you had communication with Luke Skywalker lately?  Was hoping we could compare notes","Negative. But I was a little out of pocket this weekend, so I want really reaching out to anyone","I see, yea same here. Had a great time with the in-laws","Hey bro, you available to chat real quick bout something?","What's up?","Driving, so I might be a tick slow","Well I was gonna talk with you about Darth Vader not honoring our DMZ treaty but they replied to me now and we got it sorted out","Got it. \ud83d\ude00","Well, that's not really what I expected. What's the play from here?","It's not what I wanted either but it was that our turn the whole board against us.  Ppl were already catching wind of it western triple :\/","And had I continued my Luke Skywalkern assault then Han Solo would've been unstoppable.  Nothing really changes for you however.","Well, I would've pushed on burgundy and Tyrolia if you'd given me a heads up, but c'est la vie","I wanted to give you a heads up but gotta admit there was risk in that.  I wasn't sure you would've exactly seen it the way I did lol","But it's ok. You can stay focused on Yoda if you want.  I can handle Darth Vader","Eh, Yoda's slow until R2-D2 decides to stop propping him up.  No reason not to move one army up to burgundy - I can always say it's because I'm concerned about your aggression","Ok sure that'll be nice","In that case you'd like Munich right?","I mean, I wouldn't turn it down","Ok then mun is yours","Hey you still there?","Morning","Good morning  bro. Beautiful day in the mid and nao aint it hahaha","The channel has rough waters but I  think I can survive lol","Ya know, Obi-Wan Kenobi doesn't typically try to screw the guys he talked into the Triple for a couple years, when they're nice and buried on other fronts.","I did make a huge blunder in an attempt to put the brakes on Han Solo. I'll own that","No redemption for us I guess?","There's always room for redemption!","What would that look like this turn?","At least a ceasefire and I can pull my armies out of your lands","I hear Yoda is trying to plot against me. If you agree to a ceasefire I promise to pull armies out of your lands","Or actually use one of them to help you get mar back in the fall seeing as mar will fall this spring","Although if you can give me an ounce of trust that I will move out then you'd be free to use bre and par units for the retaking of mar. Let me know what you want to do. For right now I will pull my pick army back out into my island","To be honest, I'm not going to be in a very trusting mood this turn, but if I see some backing off I will happily refocus on Yoda","Totally understand bro. Pic is going to Wales and nao holding","If that happens, I should be in a good position to lock up Yoda from further gains","Right.  It's in my best interest to leave you in peace","You shall see in a couple hours ;)","So how are we feeling brotha?","Feeling fine, hoping we're truly disengaged at this point.  I am not in any way pushing on you this turn","Ok great. And yes. Absolutely disengaged. I'm conveying Wales to nwy. Gonna havta put the brakes on Han Solo from the north or we're all screwed","My army in bel is doing nothing.  I could help you retake  marseilles if you'd like","I think I'm good there \ud83d\ude42","Very well","Assuming you're suggesting walking Bel through Bur - which would be hilarious, but I don't think actually helps much with Marseilles","How would it not help? That would give you  4 units to Yoda's 3","There are only three land spaces next to Marseille. I have two armies that can move to two of those spaces, and a fleet in the third.  There are no other spaces to put a helping army. \ud83d\ude00","Oh well if you're using both of your units there then yes there's no room for mine. I'm just saying with  mao backfilling Spain then spain could go to mar with double support and succeed. In which case I guess I could backfill mao to keep Yoda out","If I may ask, where are you from bro? Seems like our timezone don't mesh very well","I see","Good work getting Yoda to turn back","But my hours are shifted to be pretty early","East coast","Busy weekend with family?  2 whole days for a response Haha.  Was thinking you hated me :\/","I guess there really is no redemption for us eh?","Hah. I responded two days ago and forgot to hit the thumb","Ah that would do it lmao","Welp the war drums are beating loud and clear! Good luck and may the best man win \ud83e\udd2a","I still have little interest in fighting you. \ud83d\ude00","The Belgium disaster says otherwise lol","Do you have a proposal then?","You a sneaky one Haha \n\"I have *little* interest in fighting you\"","Hey, I didn't trust you were actually backing off. And if made certain commitments to the Yoda, which is now consider fulfilled","All the moves this turn are purely defensive, fwiw.","FWIW?  Not familiar with that term?","And what does purely defensive moves mean for Belgium since Belgium still is Obi-Wan Kenobi?","I will obviously be trying to keep bel Obi-Wan Kenobi","Are you forgetting some thumbs again?","Nope - was the middle of the night for me. \ud83d\ude00","FWIW -> for what it's worth","Ah I see","So what's this next year going to look like for our salvation?","Good question. I'm pinned, so I can either do something stupid or twiddle my thumbs. Any suggestions?","Idk. Do you trust me at this point?","That is the hinge of it all I believe","Not especially, but I also don't especially distrust you, and I don't trust anyone on the board especially more than you. \ud83d\ude00","Fair enough","Let's think on it a bit and see what we can come up with","I'm in caged mode, so the more your suggestion amuses me, and the more ridiculous it is, the more likely I am to run with it","Hahaha ok I'll keep that in mind lmao","I'm busy at work right now but I'll get back with you","So you wanted crazy and hilarious huh. How bout you go for mun and I go for hol","You can access ruh and bur for the taking of mun","Idk you give throw me a proposal","Sounds like fun - let me pull up the map","Sold and entered.  Any issue with me  tapping Obi-Wan Kenobi?","Just for more fun or what?","Well, two reasons.\n1) It's defensive, keeps you from getting a support on me - and doesn't look like it'll spoil anything else you'd be doing\n2) Helps hide the real reason for moving to Ruhr","Just curious was all. Yea that sounds fun","Bel will not get attacked right? Cuz it is supporting nth into hol","Not touching Belgium","Already adjudicated but tks","It's looking good for us. Darth Vader is screwed now. They chose wrong time to piss off R2-D2 lol","Oh, I guess I could have checked the map first \ud83d\ude42","Haha no worries. Did you just wake up?","No, but I just started checking messages on this computer \ud83d\ude42","Gotcha","Oh, the East is a hot mess right now.","And that ain't no lie

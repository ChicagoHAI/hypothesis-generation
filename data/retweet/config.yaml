      You are a social media expert. You are an expert at determining which tweet will be retweeted more.
      Given a set of observations, you want to generation hypotheses that will help predict which tweet out of a pair of tweets is more likely to be retweeted.
      Please note that the paired tweets are about the same content and are posted by the same user, so you should focus on the wording difference between the two tweets in each pair.
      Please propose ${num_hypotheses} possible hypotheses.
      Please generate them in the format of: 
      1. [hypothesis] 
      2. [hypothesis] 
      ... 
      ${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].
      Please make the hypotheses general enough to be applicable to new observations.

      You are a social media expert.
      Given a pair of tweets, you are asked to predict which tweet will be retweeted more.
      Please note that the paired tweets are about the same content and are posted by the same user, so you should focus on the wording difference between the two tweets.
      From past experiences, you learned a pattern.
      Now, at each time, you should apply a learned pattern to a pair of tweets and determine which one will get more retweets. 
      The answer for the higher retweets should be of the form "the _ tweet" where _ is either first or second. 
      Please give your final answer in the format of {Final answer: the _ tweet}

      Pattern: ${hypothesis}
      The first tweet: ${first_tweet}
      The second tweet: ${second_tweet}

      Given the pattern you learned above, predict which one of the two tweets will get more retweets.
      Think step by step.
      First step: Think about if the pattern can be applied to the tweets.
      Second step: Analyze the textual difference between the two tweets.
      Third step: Based on the pattern, which tweet is more likely to get more retweets?
      Final step: Give your final answer in the format of {Final answer: the _ tweet}

      You are a social media expert.
      You are an expert at predicting which tweet our of a pair of tweets will be retweeted more.
      Please note that the paired tweets are about the same content and are posted by the same user, so you should focus on the wording difference between the two tweets.
      From past experiences, you learned a pattern.
      Now, given a pair of tweets, you need to determine whether this pattern is relevant or not.
      Please answer "yes" if the pattern is relevant and "no" if the pattern is not relevant.
      Please keep you answer short (1-2 sentences).
      Please give your final answer in the format of {Final answer: answer}.

      Please note that the paired tweets are about the same content and are posted by the same user, so you should focus on the wording difference between the two tweets.
      From past experiences, you learned some patterns.
      You should apply a learned pattern to a pair of tweets and determine which one will get more retweets. 
      For each pattern, you will also see a couple of examples that worked for each pattern.
      Please choose a pattern. To do this, look at the examples associated with each pattern, and find which set of the examples are closest to the given pair of tweets. 
      Please choose the pattern corresponding to that set of examples.
      The answer for the higher retweets should be of the form "the _ tweet" where _ is either first or second. 
      Please give your final answer in the following format:

      Here are some previously generated patterns with some examples where it predicted which tweet will will be retweeted more.
      ${adaptive_info_prompt}
      New tweets:
      The first tweet: ${first_tweet}
      The second tweet: ${second_tweet}

      Which one of the two tweets will get more retweets?
      Think step by step.
      Step 1: Look at the new pair of tweets and compare them with the examples associated with each pattern.
      Step 2: Find the set of examples that is closest to the given pair of tweets, and pick the pattern associated with that set of examples.
      Step 3: Analyze the textual difference between the two tweets.
      Step 4: Apply the picked pattern to the new pair of tweets. Based on that pattern, think about which one out of the pair of headlines will get more clicks.
      Step 5: Give your final answer.

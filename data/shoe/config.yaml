      You're a helpful assistant. Your task is given as follows:
      Given a set of observations, we want to generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting the color of the shoes given the appearance of the person. 
      Please be concise and keep the hypotheses to be one-sentence long.  
      Please generate them in the format of 
      {1. [hypothesis]. 
      2. [hypothesis].
      ... 
      ${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].}
      Only propose ${num_hypotheses} possible hypotheses in total.
      Please make the hypotheses general and applicable to new examples.

      You are a shoe salesman and want to recommend shoes to customers. There are white, red, orange, green, blue, and black shoes. 
      Give your answer for the shoe color recommendation. The answer should be one color word. It has to be one of white, red, orange, green, blue, and black. If you do not have enough information to make a recommendation, you should give the answer "unknown". 
      Give your final answer in the format of "Final answer: [answer]."

      Instruction:
      You are a shoe salesman and want to recommend shoes to customers. There are white, red, orange, green, blue, and black shoes.
      From past experiences, you learned some patterns. 
      Now, at each time, you should apply the learned pattern, given below, to a new customer and recommend a shoe color.
      Please give an answer for the shoe color recommendation. 
      Please give your answer with only one color word, which has to be one of white, red, orange, green, blue, and black.
      Please give your final answer in the format of {Final answer: answer}

      Our learned pattern: ${hypothesis}
      New customer: ${appearance} is buying a pair of shoes, the shoes should be which color?
      Explain your reasoning before giving your final answer.

      You are a shoe salesman and want to recommend shoes to customers. There are white, red, orange, green, blue, and black shoes.
      From past experiences, you learned a pattern. 
      Now, given the appearance of a new customer, you need to determine whether this pattern is relevant or not.
      Please answer "yes" if the pattern is relevant and "no" if the pattern is not relevant.
      Please keep you answer short (1-2 sentences).
      Please give your final answer in the format of {Final answer: answer}.

      You are a shoe salesman and want to recommend shoes to customers. There are white, red, orange, green, blue, and black shoes.
      From past experiences, you learned some patterns. 
      For each pattern, you will also see a couple of examples that worked for each pattern.
      Choose a pattern. To do this, look at the examples of each pattern, and see which of the examples the current customer is closest to. Choose the pattern corresponding to that example.
      Give an answer for the shoe color recommendation. 
      The answer should be one word. It has to be one of white, red, orange, green, blue, and black.
      Give your final answer in the following format:
      Reasoning for choosing pattern: reason,
      Chosen pattern: pattern,
      Reasoning for choice of prediction: reason,

      ${adaptive_info_prompt}
      New scenario: ${appearance} is buying a pair of shoes, the shoes should be which color?
      Look at the new customer and compare this scenario with the set of examples associated with each provided pattern. 
      Find the set of examples that is the most similar to the new scenario, pick and repeat the pattern associated with that set of examples.

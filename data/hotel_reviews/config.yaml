      You're a professional hotel review analyst.
      Given a set of hotel reviews, we want to generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting whether a review is truthful or deceptive. In other words, we want to know whether the review is written by a someone who actually lived in the hotel.

      Using the given examples, please propose ${num_hypotheses} possible hypothesis pairs.
      These hypotheses should identify specific patterns that occur across the provided reviews.

      Each hypothesis should contain a pair of the following:
      a. A hypothesis about what makes reviews more likely to be truthful
      b. The opposite hypothesis about what makes reviews more likely to be deceptive 

      Generate them in the format of 1. [hypothesis], 2. [hypothesis], ... ${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].
      The hypotheses should analyze what kind of reviews are likely to be truthful or deceptive.

      A hotel review is the following: "${review_sentence}"

      Given the pattern you learned above, give an answer of whether the hotel review above is deceptive or truthful.
      Think step by step.
      First step: Think about which pattern can be applied to the hotel review.
      Second step: Based on the pattern, is this hotel review deceptive or truthful?

      You are a deceptive detection agent for hotel reviews. 
      From past experiences, you learned a pattern about how to judge whether a hotel review is truthful or deceptive.
      Now, given a new hotel review, you need to determine whether this pattern is relevant or not.
      Answer "yes" if the pattern is relevant and "no" if the pattern is not relevant.
      Keep you answer short (1-2 sentences).

      You are a professional hotel review analyst and you are able to determine whether a hotel review is deceptive or truthful. 
      In other words, your job is to analyze if a hotel review review is written by someone who had genuine experiences with the hotel. 
      From past experiences, you learned some patterns. 
      For each pattern, you will also see a couple of examples that worked for each pattern.
      First step: take a careful look at the examples associated with each pattern, and see which set of examples the current hotel review is most similar with. Choose and repeat the pattern corresponding to that examples set.
      Next, apply the pattern on the new sample to determine whether the new hotel review is deceptive or truthful.
      Finally, give an answer. The answer should be one word (deceptive or truthful). 
      Please give your final answer in the following format:
      Reasoning for choosing pattern: reason,
      Chosen pattern: pattern,
      Reasoning for choice of prediction: reason,

{"review_sentence": ["I recently had to stay overnight because of connections, arriving late one day and leaving early the next. The shuttle truly runs every 15 minutes without having to call - I had to go back to the airport to pick up luggage that was delayed in addition to my arrival and departure. I had a wonderful king room high up, no airport noise to speak of, large and comfortable. The front desk folks were helpful and pleasant. It is close enough to walk to the airport if you want but I did not have the time or had too much to carry. After a nice bath I snuggled up in the bathrobe that was hanging by the bathroom. I looked into the exercise facility and it looked great! I wish I had the time to use it! I will definitely stay here next time I have to pass through LAX.", "We stayed here for just one night as we had early LAX flight. The hotel is one of the closer LAX hotels which makes it nice spot for late arrivals.. etc. The rooms are nice and seem to have been renovated recently. There is valet parking as well as self park with in and out for around $17 i believe. There is a nice hotel lounge perfect for a late night drink.By far the only complaint we had is we tried printing out our boarding passes and it seemed to take forever at the nearby computer cluster but when we tried to print it asked for our credit card as if it were going to charge us for printing and when we asked front desk he said that shouldnt happen but didnt really provide us with resolution so we decided to print at airport next morning etc.", "I recently stayed at the Gateway Sheraton for 3 days and had a 4:25 flight leaving out of LAX which was literally 2 minutes away. My original check out was at 12:00, the normal time. When I called the front desk to ask about possibly getting a bit of an extension, Diane Cheek was on the other end. The minute she said 'Hello Ms Brown'...I could feel her smile through the phone. After explaining my situation, she immediately wanted to know what time I would like to check out...I hesitated and said,'2'? to which she replied...'would 3 really be better? bc that's no problem'..I couldn't believe it...I was able to relax a couple more hours in the room which made a huge difference preparing for a cross country flight. Thanks Diane and thanks Sheraton for such great customer service training for all of your employees...there is an obvious culture of 'customer first' mentality and it makes such a HUGE difference. Keep Rockin!", "Convenient for the airport, 5 minutes away, with a shuttle every 10 minutes or so. Check in was smooth and efficient which was great given it was 11pm when we arrived. As we'd booked a club level room and the club room was unavailable, we received an email a few days previously, upgrading us to a corner suite with complimentary breakfast, valet parking for our friend, and check out at 5pm which was great as our flight left at 8.30pm.Breakfast was great and use of the outdoor pool area, which was clean and tidy, was a great opportunity to catch some last minute sun.The room was big and very spacious and was a perfect stop-gap to our journey back to the UK from Hawaii.", "I wanted to appreciate the guest services staff at the Sheraton Gateway. I was inquireing about the cost and how to use the wifi connection at the hotel. Dianne explained that I could use the wifi for free any time from their extensive and comfortable lobby. She also explained the cost and procedure for using it in my room. It was quick and easy to get an account and begin to use the internet. Afterward Dianne offered to comp me the first day of use for that service. Truly, that help met my entire need, I had a need to use the internet extensively the first day I arrive. The conference I attended occupied my time more and more as the week went on. So quick use of the free wifi from the lobby just to monitor email was adequate the rest of my stay.", "I almost doubted my decision to stay 2 mins from LAX amidst the congestion on our last night instead of a more peaceful place. Wowwas I pleasantly surprised though.The dcor was very nice and looked new. There was a starbucks in the lobby open from 5am to 4pm, a sports bar, and a very nice, fancy and delicious restaurant for dinner. The close proximity also allowed me to return our rental car a day early. Theres an airport shuttle every 15 minutes and it was so close, Hertz drove us back for free personally from our car return. You could even set up a massage if you like. We had a great room service breakfast and headed out early the next morning. Id fully recommend for airport convenience without a doubt.", "Arrived at the hotel on 21st September after a late flight from London. Shuttle bus arrived after about five minutes and we were greeted by a very effusive driver who \"welcomed us to LA\". Five minutes later we arrived at the hotel and all the check in desks were quickly opened so check in was very swift. Got an upgrade to a corner room on my Starwood Gold card. Breakfast, [included in my rate] was excellent with a good choice of fruit, fried breakfast etc. Check out was also very efficient. Having stayed at LAX several times this is without doubt the best of the airport hotels. Combine a great rate for the room, including two breakfasts, $129, booked direct with Sheraton on the web and you cannot go wrong.Everything above expectation so definately will return on the next LA trip.", "I've stayed at the Sheraton Gateway a couple of times now and have been quite happy both times. As with most people, I'm only there for a night, coming or going on a business trip. The rooms are spacious and modern. The views over the airport or LA are great on the higher floors. The fitness center is one of the largest standard fitness areas I've found. There are a long line of treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes, free weights, machines, Swiss balls, and mats -- everything you need for a workout. The room also looks over on the pool area. The pool area is quite large with lots of chaise lounges if you have time to relax outside. The staff is friendly and helpful too.", "First off, our stay at the Sheraton was wonderful. We stayed here on our wedding night and everyone from the valet guys to the bell hop treated us with the utmost kindness and hospitality. The room was spacious and the bed was super comfy! We ordered breakfast from the restaurant downstairs (to go) and it was delicious! Secondly, my husband and I were lucky enough to check-in and be greeted by Mustafa at the counter. He and his team (including Gian, Rudy, Edwards and Greg) were polite, helpful and accommodating. We recognize good customer service when we receive it, and Mustafa certainly set the bar. When we returned from our honeymoon to get our car and had lost the ticket for parking, not only did he remember us from check-in, he immediately solved our problem and helped us get on our way.We will return for future stays near the airport!", "I'd taken a look at the reviews and tripadvisor, and picked this hotel based on the reviews. I was not disappointed, and if I were needing to stay in LA near the airport again would definitely pick the same hotel.The inside is nicely fitted, and the guy working on the front desk provided an excellent service checking us in, and explain a few things...set a good tone...The rooms are quite nice, and the bar and restaurant are both nice with a balance of quality and value.The only minor negative on the whole stop was in the morning when I came to use the coffee filter in the room and there was no coffee...bit annoying, but hey its never that great anyway ;-)", "I recently had to assist my colleagues with the logistics behind an export licensing seminar. The seminar lasted for two full days, and while I manned the front desk, Estrela came buy with some breakfast items for me. She had realized that I was never able to leave my desk, and made sure I did not go hungry. Since I was starving and stressed, such dedication was really appreciated. Estrela and Mr. Ortega also were quick to refill coffee for a room of participants struggling to stay awake due to the heavy natures of the topics being discussed. Mr. Ortega even took into consideration special dietary considerations from participants, and made last minute changes to have special meals. This banquet team is super professional and sweet. I hope they take care of us next year as well ^o^", "I stayed here at the end of a business trip with an early flight out of LAX the next morning. Check in was smooth. The room was clean. I'm a little heavy sleeper, but if there was any plane noise outside overnight, I didn't hear it.I used the gym downstairs which was one of the nicer hotel gyms I've been to. Plenty of equipment to use and different varieties.I was comped a buffet breakfast in one of the restaurants. Don't remember if that was from when I booked the hotel online or at check in. The breakfast was great, it was buffet style with a wait staff for drinks.The shuttles to the airport were convenient and smooth. We stopped at another hotel before going to the airport, but overall it was good.I would definitely consider staying here when flying out of LAX again.", "I have stayed at this property a few times. I have never had anything but great service. Diane who answers the phone is always so sweet,The ladies at the front counter always watch my bill to make sure I am not charged for the free Internet ( I am a state employee and get free internet) when I forget to. I had an issue with my heat not working, in less than 3 min they had a very nice man come to fix it.. even in the Starbucks area they remember me and what I drink, WOW, I have never had such great service, in all the years I have been traveling.. must stay here if you have the opportunity, AND the hotel is beautiful!!!!", "OK, so I'm biased. I'm a loyal SPG customer and try to stay at the Sheraton Gateway for my LA travel. I'm fussy about hotels. On first inspection some people might be turned off by a hotel near a large airport. Many flight crews stay here and the hotel is often booked for conventions. The management and staff of the Sheraton Gateway really get super customer service. I've never experienced this level of service at an airport hotel. I was upgraded to an executive suite - nice surprise. During past stays at this hotel, I have always ventured to the beach towns for dinner. Last week I decided to stay put and eat in the hotel restaurant, Paparazzi. I'm glad I did. The food was incredible!", "I recently visited this property (by mistake). I tried to check in at the desk but they told me they didn't have my reservation. I was ready to raise hell, but fortunately the Sheraton took care of me. If it wasn't for Edward at the Desk who took excellent care of me, I don't know what I would have done. I booked my reservation at the 4 points and Edward took initiative to make sure I no longer had to worry about where the heck I was supposed to be. He made sure I was taken cared of even if I didn't stay at your hotel. An attentive valet guy, (I think his name was Henry) brought me over to the right hotel! You have an awesome team. Edward and Henry have definately won me over. Next time I will stay with you. Keep up the good work! Kuddos to both gentlemen! Regards,Dave", "My family and I stayed over the weekend at your beautiful hotel for Spring Break. Upon check in, the Front Desk agent greeted us with a warm welcome. The Valet guys were all friendly and efficient in retrieving our car. Gabby from the Lobby Bar was amazing! She was the epitome of Excellent Guest Service. She made us feel at home. Her outgoing personality and warm touches made our whole stay very refreshing. We will surely stay at this hotel again.We got an upgraded Corner Suite and it was nice seeing the planes take off and land. My kids enjoyed this a lot. The room was very spacious and clean. Darryl Stewart, Director of Sales surprised us with a delicious amenity of cookies and drinks for the kids to enjoy.", "I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel twice within a matter of weeks. On the first stay we were updated for a little extra to their executive floor which also included some extra food vouchers to use for dinner. The food in the restaurant was very tasty and fresh. We were very pleased.The lobby was very neat and spacious and stylish. The staff was also polite.The hotel has a regular free shuttle to the airport. The rooms were just a little on the old side but they were still well maintained and very well sound proofed. We had breakfast on the executive floor and the food was great, however we enjoyed even more the full breakfast downstairs.We had a pleasant stay and everything was great. The only negative I can think of was the fact that if you want to self park the car you need to park the car behind the hotel and walking back from the parking lot behind the hotel (fully separated from the hotel) feels like a bit unsafe. However, it is a very short walk.We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.", "Stayed her at two different times as I needed a hotel near the airport. Free shuttle which was nice and convenient. Rooms and bathrooms were nice and large. Nice amenities. Free internet in lobby with plenty of computers and printers so easy to use and print boarding passes - you just need to log in with you room number and last nameStaff was friendly, food from room service was even good. Didn't hear the planes at all - soundproof to the outside. Walls to other rooms aren't sound proof - at least with the first room I had - very odd as I was standing next to the window I realized I could hear the guy in the next room very clearly on his phone without even trying.Staff was friendly and helpful.", "Like some of the other reviewers, I like the closeness to LAX, and the Paparazzi Restaurant, but I honestly loved the hotel staff and my room. When I checked in Stephan D was very nice and cordial to me, and Mustaff (I think is his name) checked me out. Both employees were very personable and friendly and checking in and checking out were a breeze. They answered all my questions and more. What I absolutely love about my room were the pillows and bedding! The pillows were Heavenly!!! I seriously want to buy these! After a ripping and running thru LAX and waiting at the baggage claim, I just wanted to rest!! I cherish a good night's sleep and I got it. It's a great hotel, with a friendly staff. Thank you! PS...can I have some free pillows? Just kidding!", "This hotel has a very unique look, from the chairs to the wallpaper. I love their style. I was in for a few nights. Normally, at other hotels the check-out process is pretty standard... leave keys at the desk and email folio. But at this Sheraton, they have outstanding customer service, as I stopped by the front desk, Edward Rayas took the time to properly handle my departure experience. He was very attentive and asked me how my stay was and if there was anything else that the Sheraton could do for me before my departure. It truly amazed me that even on my last minute at the hotel, Edward cared enough to provide me with excellent service. The Sheraton is lucky to have an agent like him! Way to go! I will definitely return to the Sheraton LAX because of his service. Also, their dinner restaurant has great food! See ya soon!", "First time stay at this hotel near the airport. I usually stay at a competing large chain down the road. This place is nicer. The interior seems to have been newly decorated. The furniture is retro hip, with lots of places to sit in the lobby. The bar and restaurant were really busy, and pretty good actually. WiFi was free and pretty reliable. Service was good. Parking was complicated, as the hotel self park lot is not well marked. Keep going straight past the hotel and park behind it for $11 a day, otherwise, prepare to pay valet rates which are more than double that. Bed was really comfortable. Bathroom was standard, these need renovating next. I would definitely stay here again. Also, there is a free shuttle to the airport, which is an easy walk if you don't have too much luggage.", "Efficient easy check-in, dropped off our rental car at Hertz who have a great complimentary driver to take you back to your hotel. Very comfy room with a pretty skyline view. Recently renovated so fresh and new. Very good late meal in the Bistro with good service. Very comfortable bed and pillows, so we had a great night's sleep to prepare for our return trip to Australia. Checked out easily next morning and the hotel kept our bags and suggested we catch the trolley to Manhattan Beach for the day, (our flight not until later that night) which stops very near the hotel. Drop off and pick up for a couple of shopping centres as well, just a great way to spend a day in LA. The airport shuttle arrived immediately on our return and we were on our way feeling relaxed and ready for the trip. This is a great airport hotel, charming friendly and helpful staff. Everything works well.", "I was there for a couple of nights and chose the hotel cause it was close to the airport, only 15 mins drive from downtown with a very reasonable price for the type of hotel. When we arrived we realized we were too tired for going out and the hotel had everything we needed. there is an italian restaurant that looked inviting, but being italians we decided not to go there (we have plenty of italian food at home!). so we decided to go at the bar which served us an excellent salad and a grilled salmon. In the morning you can have a classic \"tall cappuccino\" and a muffin at starbucks, or go to the Brasserie (very delicious). Also the room service looks good, didn't use it eventually, but seems like it has a bit of everything at good prices as well. I would definitely recommend it!!", "I wanted to commend a particular wait staff person, Estele Estrada, who was exceptional in her service. I was at a very large meeting with hundreds of my colleagues and you don't expect much in the way of service at these large meetings, however, I was pleasantly surprised with Estele. We had a buffet breakfast and lunch laid out for the participants each day, however, I had specific requests regarding my meals. Not only did Estele accommodate me the first day, she remembered my requests and provided them to me everyday I was at the functions with a smile. Estele was always friendly and courteous. WOW! I was so impressed that she would remember my dietary requests and had them at the table when I sat down. Now that's service!!Estele is the standard that other wait staff should be measured by. What exceptional service! Thanks to you, my stay was immeasurably more pleasurable, albeit a working meeting. Please make sure Estele Estrada is recognized. Good service should be rewarded!", "We stayed here for our last night in the US. The bed was super comfy, and the rooms were impeccably clean. There was a great amount of freebies in the bathroom- we were impressed with how many! We were able to get a late checkout at a minimal cost. We arrived late and were disappointed that it was too late to eat in the restaurant, however the service at the bar was really great. I'd definitely stay here again if I needed to stay close to LAX. Only one negative thing- allow a long time to get your car out of the carpark. There was only one person working on the paystation, so it was a long wait to leave.", "I'm a big fan of this hotel, esp. when I need to be near LAX to catch an early flight. Pros:-Shuttle to LAX every 15 minutes (5-7 minutes to terminal)-Generally very friendly staff-Great success with SPG plat upgrades (club rooms are very large... love the airport view... not as loud as you'd think!)-Nice SPG lounge with hot breakfast & evening snacks...drinks available all day...great view of the runway... love to watch the planes coming in and taking off!-Nice gym with pool / hot tub right outsideCons:-Personally (purely a preference thing) but I find Sheraton pillows to be way too softThat's really the only \"con\" I can think of; like I said, this a great hotel located right near LAX. Highly recommended!", "We met up with friends who were on their way to a cruise and I had suggested the Sheraton Gateway. We were so impressed with the friendliness of the staff upon check-in and when we saw the room, we thought we had bagged an upgrade,,,,,,,,,but not so! The room was spacious, the bathroom was lovely and the linens were exceptional. This was the standard room at this property.We booked reservations at Paparazzi Restaurant in the lobby. We sat in the bar before for drinks (affordable wine list) and staff couldn't have been nicer.Upon entering the restaurant, we were pleasantly greeted and led to our table. Our waiter immediately appeared for drinks orders and handed around the menu. Our group ordered a variety of dinners: halibut, sea bass and short rib lasagna. Everything was hot, well laid out on the plate and really good! We all agreed that we were impressed by the standards of this restaurant. I had booked the reservation on www.opentable.com after reading reviews from tripadvisor and also yelp.", "The Sheraton gateway is simply the very best hotel one can pick in this area.Not only the property features high end decoration and facility, the most beautifull and functional rooms and suites I ever came across and spotless upkeep but more to the point the hotel team is simply one of the very best one can found in LA in the US or even in the world.I am a very frequent traveller >100 hotel nights/year, mostly through the US coasts and in Europe, and I have been to many place both locally and internationally and this hotel team rank as the best, one of the most friendly for sure yet at the same time also the most professional and efficient I know of.Their care for their guest needs and troubles and the length to which they get to help you along is simply unmatched in my experienceAnd their kindness and friendliness make you feel right at home can not recommend it more", "My wife and I spent the night of February 25, 2012 at the Sheraton Gateway LAX as part of our 29 hour trip from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to Santiago, Chile. We found our room with king size bed, at a cost of $104 plus tax, to be clean, the bed and linens comfortable, and the flat screen television in good working order. My only complaint is that there was a $12.50 daily fee for wireless internet usage, so we elected to utilize the free computers in the hotel's lobby area. Of note: My wife and I enjoyed excellent nachos at the lobby bar. We also had the concierge book us a 7 hour tour of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills ($79 per person with VIP Tours -- pick-up and drop off at the hotel). Overall, I must say that I am very pleased with the Sheraton Gateway LAX for an \"airport hotel\". On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is terrible and 10 is excellent, I give the Sheraton Gateway Lax a rating of 8.", "I've been staying at a lot of hotels lately (to say the least), but the Sheraton Gateway is one of my favorite for sure. There is a great energy here and the staff is fantastic.One of the Valet attendants, Henry M, is super cool and always greets me with a smile. He remembers stuff about me that even I forget. Great guy and I can see him running the entire hotel one day. They whole front desk staff is really nice as well. Arlene is so friendly and always very helpful and has a smile on her face.Some more vegetarian options in the Platinum Lounge would be nice, but I'm very happy with what they offer. If you're looking for a nice and friendly place to stay in LA, I recommend this hotel.", "My family of four recently completed our third stay at this hotel. It is our hotel of choice when we stay in the Los Angeles area. The rooms, particularly the Guest Suite, are spacious, well appointed and well maintained. Although it is located right next to LAX, airplane noise was never a problem.We enjoy this hotel because it is conveniently located, is easily accessible, the rooms are nice, but most of all, we like it because the staff is so accomodating. We especially would like to compliment Whitney Johnson , Ysenia (sp?) and Stephen Dycus for making our stay so enjoyable.I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member, but when in LA, I choose to stay at this hotel. Their customer service is outstanding!", "The front desk was very nice when we got to the hotel to check in. It was me and my friend that was going to stay at the hotel. We called ahead to make sure that we had our reservation was in but the front desk agent that we talked to said there were no reservation so we just went to see what will happen. When we got there, MUSTAFA & EDDIE @ the front desk took care of us when we brought the reservation paper. They apologize about the problem and they gave us complimentary parking and made sure that we were satisfied while we were there for our stay. That is why this place a great place to stay if I have my family or friends to go there.Donjie Custodio / Melissa Hernandezcheck-in 09/18/11 check-out 09/19/11room #370", "I just wanted to drop a note about the fantastic service and care my husband and his twin brother received at the Gateway Sheraton on February 17, 2012. My sister-in-law and I worked with Mustafa Oberoi to put together a special \"guys night out\" to celebrate the boys' 42nd birthday. Mustafa was nothing but creative, attentive, and professional. After our initial meeting, where we discussed my vision for the birthday surprise, Mustafa followed up with some amazing ideas that added such unique and personal touches. He went above and beyond the call of duty, and for that I was extremely impressed and grateful. The boys had a wonderful evening at the Gateway Sheraton. As I expressed to Mustafa, my family and I have been loyal patrons of your hotel for over ten years. My husband and I were married at the Gateway Sheraton and we have celebrated every anniversary, family birthday, and social gathering at the hotel ever since. Again, please extend my sincere gratitude to Mustafa Oberoi for all of his hard work. I look forward to working with him and the Gateway Sheraton on our next celebration.", "Besides being very conveniently located and having great sleeping rooms with plenty of space and amenities, the staff here was first rate. Throughout the day, we were constantly checked on by the banquet and a.v. staff to make sure our needs were not only being met, but exceeded.We had a wonderful experience with Estela Estrada who helped us organize a reception for our attendees. She was personable and flexible. Exactly what you need when hosting an event for 100+ people.Estela is a big reason we would bring our business back to the Sheraton Gateway. She was one of many stand-out staff members.Also, Zee Bell and Tanya Cornejo were fantastic in the sales and catering department. Every request we had was met with a \"can do\" attitude. And despite numerous changes and requests we threw their way, they made sure every detail came out just as planned.I've been in the professional event business for over 20 years and this hotel has really impressed me. If you have an event to hold, whether it be for business or pleasure, the Sheraton Gateway is an excellent choice.", "I had a great experience at this hotel! From the start, we arrived a few hours early and Sheraton Gateway was able to accommodate early check-in for us witlhout any delay. The concierge service was exceptional as well. As far as Guest Services is concerned, everyone was great! Two individuals stand out to me in particular. One is a lady named Diane who made sure we received our requests in a timely manner. Another is a lady named Merlie(?) who went above and beyond to assist me with a special request. She even came out and met me at the front desk to assist me. Everyone I dealt with during this visit displayed the highest level of customer service and I would highly recomnmend this hotel to anyone visiting the Los Angeles area.", "I always stay at this hotel because it's close to LAX and the service & quality over the past six years has not declined. For an airport hotel it's got to be one of the better ones in the sheraton group offering and they don't mind if you check in for half days. Because Sydney bound flights are last to leave LAX at night - this hotel helps you unwind for the long 12 hour trip back to Sydney + the shuttle is free and the bar & internet is always pleasant.An added bonus - the hotel now offers free wi fi - something I was pleased to discover.I look forward to returning in the not to distant futureJo FredericksSydney, Australia", "Stayed 2 nights here, got great deal on Priceline, the room was classy, bathroom needs some updating but I was expecting that from previous reviews. Free computers Wifi in Lobby, no problem. Very nice pool area. Walk out the front door and go right and there is a Subway shop and parking for $14, could see our car from our room above pool area. Concierge was super helpful and check was the friendliest and fastest I've seen in a longtime. Ate in the lobby lounge very good! I was wondering about all the reviews I'd read previously from 1st time posters who raved about how nice particular staff members were, but I feel they really that nice at this hotel - genuinely helpful and friendly almost across the board!!", "Estela was the best when I was at the Sheraton last week! She made sure we had everything and she would have everything organized!She welcomes you with a warm smile and makes you fee like if you never left home.She kept asking me if I needed anything else but what really surprised me was when it was our break, she had a big line that wanted to buy things and she finished a line like maximum 30 people in less than 10 mins! She was so quick I was astonished! The Sheraton should be grateful to have someone like her. Thanks Sheraton and Estela for everything especially your undivided attention to all of us!Thanks Estela! You are the best and I will definitely recommend my friends and family to come to the Sheraton and ask for Estela!!! She is the best!The Sheraton should have more people like her that can move with ease! She should have a raise! ;D", "I visited your hotel recently for a training seminar that you hosted from August 20-22. All of your staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, but one person, Estela Estrada, far shined above the rest. She was extremely pleasant, friendly and asked if I needed anything and attended to ALL of my needs. I wanted you to know this because I hope you realize what a great person and employee you have in Estela, and I hope you show her how much you value her by compensating her accordingly. In these days and times it is hard to find employees who are loyal and strive to do their very best every day to make your hotel among the best accommodations in the Los Angeles area.", "I stayed at this hotel for convenience sake. The seminar I was attending was being held there so that's a no brainer. I was very impressed with this hotel and it's staff. Front desk staff during check in @ 11:30pm-great. Wait staff during breakfast in the restaurant Brasserie 7:45am-excellent. Very clean hotel. Even the bathrooms (in various locations on the first floor) were clean and smelled nice!!!! The hotel is across the street from the airport. I was on the 14th floor(1402) at the end of the hallway. There is a big picture window at the end of that hall and you can see planes taking off from that view. Way cool !!! I only had breakfast in the hotel (the buffet). It was $19.95. Pricey, but not bad. I intended to eat my monies worth. The fresh fruit was delicious. Sweet. My only issue was the room was not throughly cleaned. I'm a woman and I check for these things, but that was taken care of. Really nothing to make a stink over, but enough to give a 9 out of 10.", "I travel quite a bit and this entire stay was nothing but wonderful! From the pleasant bellman to the genuine smiles of the front desk staff to the amazingly chic lobby, this hotel stay was one of the best. Upon checking in, I was greeted by multiple staff and one of the staff, Bre, and I had a lovely conversation which started my stay in the right direction. The room was perfect - with Bliss amenities! We found ourselves wanting to just stay at the hotel lobby bar vs. going out. And then again in the morning at the coffee/hot chocolate bar. The hand-written note from Bre placed in my room that \"just wanted to ensure I had a pleasant stay\" was above and beyond what I experience at any hotel. It is nice to know that I don't need to look for other hotels in the area - I know where I am staying.", "I am on day 6 of a 7 day stay here at the W City Center. My first impression of the lobby and elevator was that this hotel would be perfect in Gotham City (my sons love Batman, I do not). Ironically, this hotel is not really one where you would stay with children. I find W hotels hit or miss. This one is a hit. The staff is typical friendly, the rooms are crazy clean. There are minimal things wrong with the room (missing door latch, partial flushing commode). My favorite feature at this location is their agreement they have with Acura providing a free drop off service. Also, it's location is closer to the convention center and financial buildings than the W Lakeshore. W Lakeshore is a great location if you are planning to shop in Michigan.Cool things about this W:- Free coffee in the bar on your way out- free drop off car service- Bliss bath products- cool under lighting under the beds- no bedspreads on the beds- multiple bars- spaceous room", "In town for the weekend for an anniversary with my SO, and it couldn't have gone better thanks to our stay in a fantastic hotel with courteous staff willing to go above and beyond. There is enough written on the hotel's aesthetics, but location-wise, it is hard to beat the W as well. Blocks from the Chicago river and Grant park. Get a great feel for Chicago architecture in a safe area.Most impressively, the hotel staff went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. Last minute, when tickets to the Saturday night Second City show (famous improv theater) were sold out and the box office said there was nothing they could do, the concierge (Dillon) was able to get us 4 tickets. The show was fantastic, as was our romantic dinner the evening before, also orchestrated by Dillon.Special thanks to the staff, and I strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a memorable stay in the windy city.", "W City Center is a great hotel! The staff here make sure my stay is wonderful - Each time. I travel to Chicago every week and end up staying in the W. I did try the other hotels around the loop area in my initial weeks, but the stay at W manages to beat the others. The hotel's clean and trendy and the staff here are amazing. Laurelin has been a great help and goes the extra mile, to ensure the stay at the hotel is great!The typical rooms in W are small and cozy and they have complimentary Thursday breakfast which is great. Overall, this would be my top recommendation for anyone planning to stay in the Loop area.", "I had won a free weekend stay at the W city center in Chicago. Even though we lived in Chicago, we weren't over excited about staying in a hotel when we could be home but we didn't want to waste the free nights. Before our stay, I received an email confirmation of our stay from Laurelin Hefter who was one of the concierges. Not only was she super friendly and attentive, she made reservations for us at a couple of restaurants and scheduled for a car to take us there for free. We were also given some free chocolates which my husband and I devoured because they were so good. Thank you W and Laurelin for making our weekend special!", "We stayed at the W for my son's wedding Oct 19 & 20 and got one of the newly remodeled rooms and it was spacious, bright, and very nicely done. Some of the guests were in other rooms that have not been redone and thought their rooms were very small, with hardly enough room to get around things, but our was great. Location was great, within walking distance to the reception, State St. and lots of other places. No coffee in the rooms, but it is available in the lobby. McDonalds was right next door, with lots of food options nearby. Cookies and apples available in the lobby in the afternoon. We had a good experience there. Pre arrival contact by the staff and post trip contact were very good. They are anxious to make your trip a good one.", "TK Karadzovski is one of the best hotel concierge representatives ever. She helped me when I had a very specific laundry order and was quite confused about how to place it. Also, and more importantly, I was there for a work training so I wanted to take my colleagues to a great nightlife spot. Luckily, TK was working the night I needed this info., and her advice was invaluable. We ended up going to the Violet Hour, at her recommendation, and it was everything my colleagues and I were expecting/hoping for. When I return to Chicago for work or for pleasure, which I'm sure will happen soon, I will stay at the W City Center because of the amazing and very unique level of service and expertise offered.", "O my lanta, everyone who works here was nothing but friendly to us from the moment we got in! Check in was easy, our plane was early and we got to the hotel at about 1230-1 and even check in was not until 3 they found us a room immediately. The room was nice, the bed was huge, everything was neat and clean, ha ha we checked for bugs, and there was none to be found. The concierge really made the difference, I called a week a head of time to let the hotel know it was our anniversary and if there was champagne or something I could buy for us, instead, Ms. Eden took care of everything meaning she gave us a complementary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries for our escape! This was the best weekend me and Ryan ever had and we already can not wait until we can visit chicago again, and when we do we will most definitely be staying at the W!!!!", "We stayed at the W Chicago - City Center. Yes they wowed us...everyone from the valet parking guys to Laurelin, the concierge that spend some time finding a great comedy club for us in the area and booked it for us.; this was the best, friendliest service we received from a hotel in years! The lady at the desk when checking in asked if we were here for any reason and when we told her it was our anniversary she upgraded our room size with a very warm congrats...people, it's the little things like that that just makes your day. We even had a quick drink ( from a free drink card they gaves too ) at the bar and even the bartender was super nice, asking us question about where we were from, have a great time in Chicago etc... Wow! The room was nice; the toilet was in a tight fit spot, but overall cool looking room....the W wowed us.", "My husband and I just took a weekend trip to Chicago for the 2012 marathon. My husband chose the hotel due to the proximity to race activities and the price. We were really happy with the hotel, particularly the level of service received. Among the highlights were complementary car service (connected to a promotion with Acura), use of the gym after check-out time, and great concierge service provided by Eden Bernal. She was so helpful and lovely before we arrived and several times during out stay, including finding us a terrific dinner venue in the area and booking me at a wonderful hair salon. She seemed sincerely interested in our satisfaction and enjoyment during our stay. While the room was small (my only real gripe) it was not unexpected and the hotel more than compensated for it with cleanliness, service, nice lobby and gym facilities, location, etc.", "I stayed here overnight for an interview. It is in a great location within walking distance to the office building. The room is very comfortable, and the lighting and decoration creates an elegant atmosphere. Upon learning that I asked about complimentary breakfast and was here for an interview, Mr. Stephen Bee (the manager on duty) gave me a $20 free breakfast voucher along with a card wishing me good luck. He also allowed me to delay my check-out time without extra charge so that I did not have to worry about this during the interview around noon. These are very kind and thoughtful gestures that I deeply appreciate. After the interview was over, Ms. Laurelin Hefter at the front desk patiently helped me make a reservation for an architectural boat tour. When I couldn't make it later because of change of schedule, she and Georgia, who was also at the front desk, facilitated the refund for me. I have been to many hotels in both the U.S. and Asia. I will say without reservation that this hotel has offered the best personable service I have ever seen.", "My hubby and I were in town for a Women's conference at the University of Chicago. After a long day, the last thing that we wanted to do was to spend hours searching for a perfect spot to dine. As we strolled through the lobby, we spotted TK and approached her. Our request was for a great place for Sushi, without blinking she said Roka Akor, then what time do you need it for? Can you say VIP? The reservation was made for us immediately. Fast forward to the restaurant, it was amazing. TK arranged for a prime table on a Friday night at very busy spot. The food was spot on amazing, and to make the experience even better, TK treated us to a nice sashimi appetizer. First class all the way. When you want it done right, TK is the LADY to ask. Thank you TK, and W Hotel for a great stay.", "Read this if you are one those business travelers that pack your running shoes to attempt to squeeze in a much needed run. I was 2 miles out on my jog and tripped an sprained my ankle. Lucky for me a good Samaritan drove me back to the hotel (can you believe it...in Chicago). I was met by TK (concierge) at the W. She was great in finding a urgent care center for me and securing the W courtesy car. Within 10 minutes I was out the door and on my way to the urgent care center. BTW, if you need medical care it's a great urgent care center and its only 4 blocks from the W, right down Adams.Again, thanks to TK I was able to get some quick medical care in time to make a business dinner later that night.", "My stay was a Starwood rewards night, which really sweetened the deal because my bill was $0!Love the atmosphere and laid back attitude at this hotel. Few families, mostly business travelers and a chill crowd.Staff was great and didn't mind at all that I brought my bicycle into the hotel and up to my room. They even offered to store it for me in their secure luggage room! Wow!I was afraid I would get yelled at and told bicycles were not allowed. They didn't mind at all and were so helpful.(PS it's not the kind of bike one leaves outside in Chicago overnight.)For my experience the only drawback about this hotel was the location. Nightlife and restaurants outside the hotel are not close by. So if you go out at night there is nothing in the immediate area of the hotel. But if you plan to stay in, relax, or hang out at the hotel that doesn't matter. I have also stayed at the W on Lake Shore Dr, but I liked the city center one better.", "Stayed at the W on a brief business trip. Arrived late and tired to be greeted by extremely nice and helpful W hotel staff. My room was exceptionally clean and spacious - a welcomed surprise. I stopped at the concierge desk for assistance finding a nearby restaurant that would accommodate my gluten allergy. TK Karadzovski, the concierge was simple fantastic; patient, articulate and diligent at finding an excellent restaurant for us! The Custom House was not only fabulous but very accommodating for my gluten allergy. Even more impressive, the next night, we arrived back to the hotel after a long day of meetings and stopped by the concierge desk again for another great recommendation. TK, with her own dinner in hand, was on her way out for her dinner break. We thanked her for the excellent recommendation the night before and expected to work with the 2nd concierge who was sitting at the desk. Without hesitation, TK put her dinner down and cheerfully asked, what kind of dining are you looking for this evening? And began pulling up options for us. Now that's dedication! We highly recommend the W, but especially TK at the concierge desk!", "This place is fantastic. Both concierges, Eden and TK, made this such an enjoyable experience and made planning our 'escape' so much easier. Not only were they able to pick up tickets for us (and helped us avoid lines) for multiple highly popular attractions around the city, they were also happy to provide excellent restaurant recommendations and took the time to provide the highest level of service to each person hoping to have their attention. Didn't do room service cause we aren't high rollers. Elevators, lobby decor etc. were very cool and they played pretty decent music for the most part. For a t-shirt and jeans kind of person, this was too rich for my blood. But we loved it. Just had a wonderful time in Chicago and this was a fantastic location to call home base. That being said, we like to walk - and don't mind walking 20/30 mins to get to another neighborhood.", "Well me and my wife booked our room with SPG cash and points which was a great deal. The location of the hotel is in the financial district but close to millennium park and miracle mile area. The service from start to finish was phenomenal. Tk at the concierge was so helpful. She made reservations to this wonderful sushi restaurant for us. We even booked the courtesy Acura MDX car they have to get us there!! The restaurant service up'd their game when they found out we were from the W. We got a complementary appetizer with our order. My wife loves the Bliss spa stuff so the room cleaning person gave her some extras when we were leaving the room the next day. It's these little things that the hotel staff does that leaves the biggest impressions. I personally really enjoy staying at the W and Meridian hotels so I will do what I can to stay at them. It's the main reason I got a SPG Amex card.", "Even before I checked in, I was provided service the W Brand is known for: Whatever/Whenever. Eden, a member of the Concierge Staff, was hospitable before I even arrived, giving me easy to understand instructions on how to catch the train from O'Hare to the hotel. She also recommended using the Acura service (awesome!) to get between the W City Center and W Lakeshore where I used the pool and also had a spa appointment at Bliss (also awesome!). Eden made great recommendations for enjoying my weekend getaway in Chicago.The Welcome Ambassadors made my arrival experience wonderful. Amanda at the Welcome Desk has a great personality and made check-in easy. The W Living Room Bar staff also provided great service. I highly recommend W Chicago - City Center!", "A walk into the lobby is like walking into a nightclub! I planned a meeting there and all of my attendees loved the decor the ambience of the building. Service was outstanding as has been with all of the W and Westin properties. Furthermore, it is a nice experience to do something like this venue for a meeting than the other standard hotels. The staff was wonderful and of note - the concierage referred us to a fantastic restaurant then the W sent chocolate cover strawberries to our group at the restaurant. Anyone who would like a change needs to experience a W!", "Weather for business or pleasure, make the W City Center in Chicago one of your top choices. The rooms are stunning, the service is impecable and the on-site restuarant and bar are fabulous. I stayed for an entire week and didn't have any complaints most times I didn't even want to leave the hotel. It's conveniently located to lot's of shopping (on the Magnificent Mile), the Sears Tower, and many other tourist hot spots. The next time I visit Chicago, I'll be sure to stay at the W City Center.", "When they answer the phone whenever, whatever they mean it. Service it not an after thought at this property. Add in the unique sleepinp rooms, beds to good to be believed and meeting space that is very versatile. What more could any planner ask for. From the moment the doorman says. Welcome to the W you begin a hotel experience that will be worth remembering.", "I stayed at this location in June and July of 2011. Immediately upon book the reservations I received an email from Eden Bernal offering assistance to accommodate my trip. The breakfast buffet is good. During both stays she provided assistance with reserving excursions such as a city bike ride, car and dinning reservations and connected me with a great personal trainer. Most recently, during my dinning at Epic (which she arranged) to our surprised the waiter provided complimentary champagne courtesy of Eden. As a young professional who travels monthly, Eden's professionalism and kindness are cherished!", "I took my father on a birthday trip that was a trip of a lifetime. If it werent for Laurelin we would not have been able to have the experience we did. She has us managed around the city with great recommendations, directions on trains, amenities, bank locations with such a great attitude. She followed up everyday and really helped me not only during but before the trip even began. I have never seen someone work so well with a crowd when we came at a busy check out time too! The rooms were great and I couldnt ask for a better location! I love The W, I never stay anywhere else for the service I recieve at these great properties.", "Hotel was great as always expected!!! From the moment the doormen open the doors upon arrival, to the mood generating music, the quick and attentive check-in, this is how it should be done. With some extra help from Laurelin (a W Insider - a best kept secret - ask for her), I was able to get everything I needed for a successful, productive, and relaxing trip. TK also helped me find a rental car nearby that was super convenient. I've been wanting to try the Lakeshore W but keep coming back to the City Center location for the superb service and amenities. Oh yeah, IPO restaurant downstairs has a killer French Toast too!!! Moreover, the breakfast baffut is really, really good. I always look forward to staying at W City Center when in Chicago.", "To start off, I have never stepped foot inside the W Chicago - City Center, however the service I have received thus far has been nothing but amazing. I spoke to Vanessa and she has been helpful, kind, courteous, and most importantly patient with all my requests to surprise my fiance with an amazing welcome gift for her bachlorette party. She made suggestions and provided me with ideas that I couldn't have dreamt of. Vanessa also made it clear to me that she would be on vacation, but the staff would have detailed instructions of how to present all the items and from what I have heard, it has been phenomenal. Thank you so much to the W staff, you have surpassed all my expectations!!", "My experience at the W City Center, actually began about a week before my visit. \"My W Insider,\" Laurelin H, was very proactive in reaching out to understand my reason for visiting, any planned activities, assistance with booking tickets, etc. All of her recommendations were great, and we did leverage the team at the W to book our Boat Architecture Tour. During our correspondence, Laurelin discovered that we were attending the Cubs game while in town. With this in mind, she very thoughtfully delivered complimentary Cubs hats for my girlfriend and me. Nice touch! Generally speaking the hotel and accommodations were consistent with other W hotels I have stayed at - trendy, fun, luxury with a sense of attitude. Great job to the entire staff at the W - and to Laurelin in particular. Had a great weekend in Chicago, and it was enhanced by the helpful nature of the W staff.", "The W City Center, Chicago, is a fine hotel in the W tradition. The Location can't be beat just a couple of blocks away from Grant Park and a blocks or so away from the Sears Tower. The best part of our W experience was however the staff. Always helpful and courteous, the staff, I felt went above and beyond their normal duties to help our party to be comfortable, and accomadated our early check in request with ease. The facilities were wonderful and the style of the hotel was hip as always. Special recognition goes to Eden Bernal, the concierge who was able to direct me to a post office, book a wonderful tour and even look up the address of the New York State department of Taxation and Finance for me. Did I mention that the wedding that we went to at the Hotel was wonderful as well? all in all nothing to complain about...and I love to complain.", "Arrived at the W, to be greeted by the awesome decor and upon checking in, we asked where the nearest drugstore was, bc we left our saline solution for our contacts. The gentleman checking us in, opened a drawer behind the desk and proceeded to hand me a great size bottle of Saline Solution. I was so surprised and thrilled! The room is gorgeous- perhaps a little dark, because I love light so I notice things like that, but the room was great. Anyway, we ate at the restaurant connected to the W- and it was amazing and I am still dreaming about some of the dishes we ate... Our waitress, Emily, who was new, was so sweet and just really tried to make the experience perfect for us. The only thing I can say is that in general, Chicago tap water tastes like pool water- but that's not their fault :)We had the most amazingly patient and knowledgable concierge, Eden, who helped my husband get on the architectural tour and all sorts of information for his day while I was in a meeting. The complimentary coffee was even wonderful!", "My wife and I had a 4 day getaway weekend from Montreal at the W City Center in Chicago. As we have stayed at various W Hotels in the past, none have ever compared to the overall experience as this one.Every single person on the W Team could not do enough for us. The service from start to finish was beyond incredible. Eden, the concierge from the moment we arrived, was simply amazing. Not only was she sweet and kind but she helped organize our entire weekend and made us experience a weekend to remember in beuatiful Chicago. Moreover, the breakfast buffet is really good. We were also pleasantly suprised along the way with glasses of champagne and free desserts that were graciously provided by Eden and the W at various restaurants over our stay. Thank you Eden and the W for a weekend we will never forget.", "I'll start by saying I got a pretty good deal on our room and received an upgrade to the spectacular room. I did hear someone on the elevator say that her room was very, very small which I assume are the smaller class rooms. The W has a very impressive very modern and trendy lobby space. They laid out cookies in the afternoon! Our room was very large and had views of the buildings nearby which was kind of interesting. I loved the wordy deco themes throughout the room and it came with this kaleidescope which I also found kind of cute. Bedding was comfortable and in general I would say the room was very clean. I loved the Bliss products so much so that I may go by the facial cleanser now.The location of the hotel was very near to the Chicago Institute of Art and milleneum park but further away from the restaurants we ended up wanting to go to by foot. I love walking in new cities so that was in no way a negative point.Great weekend vacation and having a nice room to come home to definitely contributed to our fun mini-break.", "As a frequent guest at W properties in NYC and LA the aesthetics were as one comes to expect from the brand, nice renovations of older buildings. What made my trip was the amazing service which started a week before I arrived. Eden the concierge reached out to see if she could could schedule car service to dinner each night of our stay and made reservations for one of the river's architectural tours. When we actually arrived, the front desk was kind enough to check us in five hours early. Our Acura driver each night was beyond helpful, he didn't making the occasional detours for our errands and showed us a few spots around town we never would have found on our own.The room was clean, well appointed, and rather large. It's hard to imagine doing any better at this price point.One of the most enjoyable hotel experiences I have had in the past few years.", "Best hotel I have stayed at in the USA. They go above and beyond. Eden is great and very helpful. They checked us in 3 hrs early which almost never happens in U.S Hotels. Bed was really comfy and nothing was too much trouble. Decor is very funky. We were emailed a couple of days before arrival with an upgrade special which we took advantage of. I didnt see the lead in rooms but i reccomend the next category up - our room was HUGE. The bathroom was also. Good location - close too everything but not too close. All staff are extremely helpful. Cant wait to stay at another W Hotel. Really a great hotel - do not hesitate.", "My husband and I stayed at the W City Center while visiting our son. It was also our anniversary (the hotel did not know about the reasons for our stay). We had a great experience. We chose to get 500 star points per day in exchange for not having our room made up---great choice! We still were able to get fresh towels and more WONDERFUL BLISS PRODUCTS when we needed them. Love love love those Bliss products!!! Anyway, TK sent us complimentary free beer (a bucket) and peanuts, printed boarding passes for us, and generally was amazing. I was able to walk quickly to the Institute of art to get a quick bit of culture. The decor is a bit funky and fun. I love the scents in the elevator. The room service omelets were STUFFED with filling. We will be back. Thanks TK!!!!!!", "It was my first trip to Chicago and staying at the W Chicago definitely contributed to the wonderful experience I had. On my second morning there I went down to the hotel's restaurant (IPO) for breakfast. I was waited on by Emily and mentioned that it was my first time in Chicago. Emily and I started talking about Chicago and were soon joined by staff members, Nicole and Emmiko. Those three ladies were incredibly pleasant and friendly and shared a lot of good information with me about Chicago as well as their enthusiasm for their city. It was such a warm and positvie encounter and left me feeling as though I had had my own personal welcoming committee to greet me to the W and to Chicago. The next night the ladies sent a gift to my room...Garrett's gourmet popcorn of Chicago...WOW! By the way I'm not a good looking young man - I'm a woman old enough to be their mother. I can't wait to come back and stay at the W Chicago!", "First let me start by saying I am always reading reviews for real life examples of a place so I understand if it's worth my money. Let me say the W is Well worth the money. I arrived at the hotel and the staff IMMEDIATELY began catering to my needs. The check in staff made sure that I had all of the accomadations for our anniversary. I wanted it to be special since it was a milestone and Eden, Vanessa and Allen made SURE OF IT. They constantly made several phone calls to pull together all the final details of my evening. I stepped in the room and it was absolutely BREATH TAKING! Lovely from top to bottom. This staff truly has been one of my BEST EXPERIENCS!!!!! Thank you W!", "This was my first time staying at the W City Center since my conference was closer to the Westin River North. However, I will be staying here from now on. The psersonal attention from the greeters to the front desk was very professional. Amanda greeted me at the front desk and apologized for my room not being ready (9:02 am) but offered me things to do, places to go, food to eat based on what I liked. She was very attentive and always smiled. Later in the week, concierge Laurelin Hefter was right on about suggesting various restaurant venues based on my preferences, not hers. The entire staff was amazing and made my 5 nights feel I was a VIP. The room was spacious, updated to accommodate technologies, and the entire building was very clean. The Acura service was an added bonus. I will definitely come back and refer friends.", "My wife and I needed a place to stay for the last night of our anniversary trip. We stayed at another hotel for the first 3 nights as it was connected to her business trip. This was a great way to end our trip! The service was excellent. Eden, the concierge, contacted me two weeks before our stay, where she and I came up with a surprise for my wife upon arrival! Eden went the extra mile in securing the special candy bars that my wife loves. The room was funky and fun. Very clean with a comfortable bed. The front desk was another surprise as they greeted us with a warm welcome and got us a very early check in. The Living room lounge was a lot of fun as well. We invited some friends to hang out for some after dinner drinks there. It was a lot of fun and was not too loud.This was my first stay at a W hotel. We will definitely be back.", "I have stayed here many times on business travel. The hotel is centrally located in the city, within walking distance to the offices, the Willis Tower, and other points of interest. Every single time, save for one, I have been able to check in well before the normal time, usually arriving around 10am. The rooms are always clean and quiet, with some more spacious than others. The amenities are plentiful and the room service prompt. The concerige was always available to provide restaurant recommendations and arrange reservations for our large group. The psychadelic decor in the lobby and elevators is a bit eccentric, but the rooms are much more toned down. Only complaint is that one trip a maintenance man entered the room when the do not disturb sign was posted, but management was quick to remedy the situation and provide future upgrades and SPG points as an apology. I would not hesitate to stay here again for business or leisure.", "This was my first stay at a W Hotel, and I was so impressed! I booked a room for my husband's and my anniversary using my SPG points. When we checked in, Amanda at the front desk could not have been nicer or more accommodating. I wasn't expecting a room upgrade, but she upgraded us to a Spectacular Room - and spectacular, it was! Through our conversation during check-in, she asked if we had dinner plans, and I mentioned we had reservations at a restaurant in the West Loop. Amanda then arranged for the hotel's car service to take us to dinner. I wasn't expecting such star treatment, but Amanda made us feel as though we were frequent guests. The next morning, I went in search of a newspaper, and Fatima at the front desk offered to send someone out to find it for me. Again, I was very impressed. I travel frequently for work, and its rare that you find a hotel that is so customer-service oriented with employees who truly appear to love their jobs. After our experience at the W, we definitely will be back!", "I absolutely love this Hotel! The service is second to none, the staff is always friendly, remember your name - greet you with a smile always!Immediately upon booking, i spoke with my Concierge (Eden - if you get a chance, ask for her) and she took care of all my reservations even before i arrived in town! All the vouchers were waiting for me at check in!We visited during the NATO summit - and she kept us aware of road closures and areas to avoid during that time! I was very impressed. The free Acura shuttle is a nice program - you can get to where you wanna go pretty easily.I asked for a slightly delayed checkout, and they offered it without the slightest hesitation! Couldnt thank the staff enough.", "I'm not sure how I skipped writing a review of the Magnolia until now, but this is definitely my \"go to\" hotel when I'm in Houston. It may not be a 5 star hotel in the rule book, but just about everything here is perfect. The rooms are nice, but what really sets the Magnolia apart is the service. From the valet, to front desk, to bar staff - I've always felt welcome. The only thing to watch out for is the price. It's usually in line with other luxury downtown hotels, but occasionally it will spike up due to demand (which is completely understandable). It's a great hotel - but not great enough that I'll pay substantially more than I would for another comparable hotel in the area.", "Recently I brought a group of volunteers to Houston to visit NASA as a thank you for their hard work over the year. We needed a place to stay that would show our appreciation to the volunteers but would not break the bank. The Magnolia group sales worked with us to meet our small groups needs. Our volunteers loved the hotel rooms, beds and especially the showers (great water pressure). As a non-profit organization, I appreciated the inclusion of the welcome cocktail reception, the milk and cookie bar at night and the full hot breakfast in the morning. Free internet also provided an extra benefit for a good price.If your travels take you to Houston, I would recommend the Magnolia Hotel.", "This is a great boutique hotel in a gorgeous historic buidling right in downtown. Every view is a good view. The staff go above and beyond! I recently booked a conference here and the feedback from everyone was that the hotel exceeded expectations and made everything simple. I have stayed here before for a romantic weekend wth my spouse. It is within walking distance to events and restaurants. This trip we brought the kids for a one-night get away, even though we live in Houston. They loved milk & cookies. Our room was spotless and decorated in a modern style. There was an event going on - maybe a rehearsal dinner - and everyone seemed to be having a great time. It is a nice mix of people and as always, the staff was speedy and helpdul. We even used the pool and hottub and got some fantastic pictures of the city skyline!", "LOVED the size of the bathtub - perfect for a relaxing bath, great breakfast buffet - plenty of choices, both healthy and not-so-healthy (eggs, bacon!!!, sausage, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, yogurt, waffles), milk and cookies was a nice treat at night, and the staff was really nice, even though they had a surprise lobby remodeling starting the day we arrived. The beds were incredibly comfortable, and the rooftop pool and hot tub were nice, except we only got in the hot tub once, and it was scalding hot. I'm sure if we had notified the staff, they would have done something about it. It was a nice, relaxing downtown hotel in a great location - only about a block from the light rail, super easy to get around town. If I'd stayed longer, I'm sure I would have spent some time in their library on the second floor - yes, they have an actual library, with readable books. Supercool place to stay.", "Love this hotel. The staff is always so nice and friendly and they are always super accommodating. Love that they give you a nice full breakfast in the morning with eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, cereal, bagels, oatmeal, biscuits and gravy, fruit, and more...!!! And at night it's nice to get a 2 free drinks and then later milk and cookies!! The BAR staff is A+++, if your bartender is Billy or Jess, tell them Ashley from CT says Hi!! They are the best! The food selection here is pretty good as well. The rooms are clean, the gym is clean as well and has towels and is never crazy packed, maybe a little more in the morning then the evening.", "A great place to stay. It absolutely MADE our trip to Houston the great trip that it was. The hotel had character, was very comfortable, right in the middle of everything, and the goodies (you've read about them all already, no need for me to elaborate) are impressive. Only complaints regarding the free stuff -- oh, of all the things to complain about -- was that the breakfast was ultra-busy and the hot food didn't really appeal to me, and I wish there was a better choice or selection of beer at the happy hour. Miller Light? Bleh. Anyway... Service was exceptional (really, it was. They care here, they really do). The rate we got was amazing, especially considering all we got for it. Most impressive of all, the rooftop pool was breathtaking and an incredible treat, especially on those hot days (aren't they all in Houston?).A wonderful place to stay and an incredible value.", "I was in Houston on business for just 3 nights. The Magnolia is probably one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The room was lovely, very generous proportions in both bedroom and bathroom. Very clean with all expected additions including coffee maker (stayed at Four Seasons last year and didnt even have a kettle in the room!! - not good if you are British!). Breakfast was very relaxed buffet - would have liked the odd tomato but realise I was in the US :-) Reception staff very helpful with all my computer/printing needs. But the Valets were exceptional - sorted me out with taxis and recommendations for my 1 hour off for shopping, called shuttle when late - and generally looked after me!I had a great stay and will definitely be back here if lucky enough to visit Houston again.", "We were in town for our son\"s wedding. The valet service was quick & convenient except for a small ding on the passenger-side door which I don't think was there before. The check-in was fast and she was very courteous explaining all the hotel amenities. We had a mini-suite with a kitchen & huge walk-in closet & great views of the city! The roof-top pool & hot tub are awesome with amazing views of the city. We didn't have time to use the pool & hot tub at night, but next time we will. The hotel was very clean & quiet. The maid service excellent & very friendly. The hot breakfast was delicious with lots of choices. I really liked the oatmeal and waffles!. The only negative was the elevators were slow Sunday morning when we were leaving but they had already had over 200 check-outs! We had to wait about 30 minutes for a luggage cart so you might want to call early if in a hurry. I would definitely stay here again!", "If you are looking for a home away from home, the Magnolia Hotel in Houston is the place to stay. With the abundant morning breakfast, friendly staff and clean rooms this is one of my top hotels. In the early evening they have complementary wine and beer and cookies in the late evening. One of my favorite things about the hotel was the free shuttle to anywhere within the two mile radius of downtown Houston. Public transportation is good, but when it is hot and humid, an air conditioned shuttle is the place I like to be. It is a 15  20 minute walk to Minute Maid Park, the Convention Center and Toyota Center, but as I said, I would take the free shuttle. Dont forget to tip your friendly driver!", "I was in Houston for one day and gave it a shot. Nice place, with a reasonable rate. Spacious rooms and free internet that didn't require an IT degree to get working. Evening reception is always a nice touch. I can't comment on the normal lounge area though as it was closed due to a wedding. The reception was held in the breakfast area. Good showers are a big deal to me - this one was very good. Plenty of volume, nice showerhead, and no puddles in the tub. There isn't a self park associated with the hotel. I rarely valet may own cars, so there is a self park garage 1 block away at rates better than the valet.", "What a nice property with a lot of amenities, nice staff and good location in downtown Houston. Food is average, rooms adequate with good AC (needed year round in Houston). We stayed two nights and the Saturday night stay was crazy. Elevators jammed and no way to valet park. Lots of confusion. Pool was crowded too. Sunday was a dream - none of the troubles from Saturday. Ice was only on a couple of floors -kind of inconvenient. Breakfast pretty good - nice for families. The happy hour was good but store bought cookies not great. All in all, a nice stay. They really try to make you feel comfortable. Need more staff and expanded facilities when functions like weddings are going on at the hotel.", "We selected this hotel to have a special celebration for the 60th bd party. Because of the hour we decided to stay. We are blown away with the hotel, service, location, and treatment. We had a super blast at the party but the rooms were so special--one of the rooms had a stove top included in the suite. We had a wonderful time and the staff were totally accomodating. This was truly a wonderful find and one that we will certainly use again and again. If you are in the Houston area, you need to make this one of your must dos!!! Quality and value can not be beat. Add this to the supreme location and you have a winning combination with Magnolia.", "Really enjoyed my stay here on a business trip recently. I stay in over 100 room a year in hotels so I'm very particular with where I stay. A friend had recommended the Four Seasons in Houston for my trip. I stayed one night at the Four Seasons (that's in another review) and I can say that the Magnolia blew the Four Seasons out of the water. The room I got was a huge king suite. It was bright, clean, and comfortable. The breakfast was free and added to the value of the room rate I paid, which was half that of the Four Seasons and other similar hotels. Valet was fast and friendly. Only thing I would say that needs a little work is the front desk. They weren't very warm or friendly when I checked in, but they got the job done so that's a start.", "My husband and I stayed one night at the Magnolia Hotel and we wished we could've stayed longer. The hotel is beautiful and modern and our room was spotless. Location is excellent, in the heart of the city, so valet parking was a plus. We weren't able to make the happy hour, but bedtime milk and cookies were a fun perk! Breakfast was included in the price and we were satisfied with variety and taste. Our only complaint would be that there aren't enough elevators for a hotel of the Magnolia's size, but that's not really something that is easily fixed. Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay- the price is hard to beat, especially with all of the wonderful amenities.", "We stayed at the Magnolia in downtown Houston due to a wedding reception held there, but we will definitely stay again any time we are in Houston. Right from the valet parking when we pulled up to the front, to the smallest detail at the wedding reception, the staff was professional and friendly throughout. The room was large and comfortable and quiet. Although the safe didnt work and the refrigerator was stocked with items for purchase, they did have in-room coffee as well as room service, which we didnt use. They offer a nightly reception in the lobby offering complimentary beer, wine and sodas, and then later set up a cookie bar with delicious cookies, coffee and milk. The breakfast serves enough items to find something you will like and is kept fresh. The location is downtown and near the rail-line, so if you wish to get around Houston while staying here, it would be very convenient.", "I stayed at this hotel for one night on a business trip to Houston. I have to say, this is probably one of the best (if not the best) business-oriented hotels I have ever stayed at. The rooms were very nice - comfortable bed, lots of space, large bathroom. Beyond that, the service and amenities at the hotel were fantastic. The hotel offers a free \"happy hour\" for all guests where you can have two free alcoholic beverages each evening in their lounge area. Breakfast is also included in the price and while not a huge selection, I found the quality to be very high (sometimes quality is more important than quantity!). I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Houston.", "My fiance and I stayed at Magnolia Hotel for one night in May 2012. The location near Minute Maid Park was excellent, and the hotel itself was phenomenal. The room was large and well-appointed and the bed was fantastic. Free perks such as breakfast and evening receptions added value to our stay. The breakfast area was busy so it was somewhat hard to find a seat, but the food was continuously stocked so it was not a problem to have a lot of traffic. Rooftop pool was on the small side but the views were wonderful.The one issue we had was that we went to the hot tub in the morning and had some jewelry tarnished because too much chlorine had been added. We raised the issue with the management, who resolved the matter promptly with a small discount on our bill.", "The staff was courteous and friendly, and this means everyone. The parking valet was the best I have ever encoutered and I took my car out frequently. They seemed to know me and they were just fabulous. Also the valet was great. I had a fair about of luggage and am mildly disabled (not that they could tell) but from the time they took it out of my car to the time thay put it back in (2 1/2 days) they were very careful with my things and were really helpful and friendly. The frony desk put up with my many phone calls to tem with a smile even when it was 3PM and they were mobbed with people checking in. The maid was also pleasant as I was in the room when she cleaned. I just can't say enough about the people and the hotel and it's amenities were outstanding. I will definatey stay there again, even though I live in Houston. Wonderful!", "We did a girls weekend in Houston and the Magnolia Hotel was the PERFECT choice!!! Very centrally located to everything you want to do in downtown Houston. The shuttle/towncar service around the area was great to have, but a lot of the places we wanted to go to were just a few blocks away. The staff was wonderful, very polite and helpful. The evening reception with complimentary happy hour was great! The complimentary hot breakfast buffet with eggs and bacon and everything you could possibly want for breakfast was incredible!!! The room was clean and large, we had plenty of room for 4 girls to get ready for a night on the town. There were two wedding receptions going on at the hotel the night we stayed and our room was so quiet, never heard any noise from neighbors or anything. Also, you should definitely check out the rooftop pool and hot tub, AMAZING views of downtown at night and during the day.", "We had a wonderful stay at the Magnolia Hotel Houston. We came to Houston to attend Astro baseball games. Minutemaid Park is only several blocks from the Magnolia. Although it is an easy walk, the hotel has a complimentary shuttle that will take you to downtown destinations including Minutemaid Park. The Magnolia is also a short walk (3 blocks maybe) to the Light Rail that we took to the Museum District. Also easy access to the underground tunnels and shopping in Houston. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable with its own temperature control. The bedding and bed was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and clean. The wireless internet was complimentary and worked well for us. The hotel staff was very friendly and the complimentary breakfast buffet was delicious. Thumbs up to the Magnolia on all counts.", "We have stayed twice at this hotel and have nothing but great things to report. Check in, friendly and fast. Rooms, bery spacious, clean , comfy bed and clean lines throughout. Complimentary happy hour and cookie time, need I say more. And it's really free, (2 drinks per person, choose between red/white wine or miller lite, and cookie time with multiple selections of great soft cookies). Complimentary town car service was very quick and clean, nice cars. Bartender was great and friendly with some suggestions for dinner and night life. Front desk, great and quick service, we had a prob with the safe and the handyan was there within 3 mins and fixed it and out the door in 2 mins. Valet, quick service and never felt neglected or second in line. Great location, we were able to walk everywhere for everything except for late night food.  I would recommend this hotel over and over again. Thanks for the great and refreshing customer service:)", "If you need a total hotel experience as a business traveler in downtown Houston, look no further. This is THE hotel to book. Great small hotel with all the amenities for a business stay. Location is excellent with many quality restaurants nearby. Free Internet. Great customer service, wonderful free breakfast. I don't get reviews that are dissatisfied with the breakfast! The atmosphere is relaxed and the rooms are fabulous. I am staying in a signature suite-hard to find in downtown Houston. It is really a small apartment that feels like home. I'm moving back to Houston but would stay here for a romantic weekend away from home with my husband just to get away and have a nice weekend in a hotel that feels like a step back in time. I have traveled all over the world and this is at the top of my list as one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had.", "My husband and I were in town for a wedding and stayed 2 nights at the Magnolia. The hotel is beautiful, the rooftop pool was sparkling clean with towels rolled up on chairs waiting for you and the view gorgeous. Now to the room - Nice big tub, bed and bedding was heavenly. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Close to theaters, bars and restaurants and what I think was the Astros baseball stadium. Complimentary drinks at happy hour, free breakfast buffet and milk and cookies a nice bonus. Beautiful old church across the street. They provided a car to take us to the reception downtown and I realized once we were there I had forgotten the wedding gift in my room. I figured it was a long shot, but called the concierge and thought I'de ask the impossible. They picked up the gift from my room and brought it to me at the bar within the hour! I love this hotel and will be staying there every time I go to Houston.", "I have stayed here twice now for business trips. This hotel has far exceeded my expectations each time. The hotel is very modern and clean. The offer great services such as happy hour, milk and cookies and they have a great fitness room. One added benefit is the pool and hot tub are on the roof of the hotel overlooking downtown Houston. In fact my associates saw my hotel the first time there and all 9 of them changed their hotel to the Magnolia when we went back the second time!! Plus the shuttle providing service downtown is another great resource for the Magnolia Hotel. If I am back in Houston, I will definetley be staying at the Magnolia Hotel!!", "I was very concerned with the noise level of this hotel but I had a great night's sleep while staying at the Magnolia. The location was great for my purposes (my son's band played at a venue around the corner) and there the restaurant selection was excellent. The hotel was very crowded (there was a wedding plus....) but I must say despite my concerns and having a room on the street side, I had an excellent stay at the Magnoila. The breakfast was great, cookies and milk, happy hour were great and I will stay here again. Warning: I ordered veal from a restaurant across the street. After a 20 minute wait the waitress informed me that no veal was available. When I asked for my bill, she said it was $5.00 for my salad. I gave her a $20 and he gave me $6 back. I ate a restaurant next to my son's venue, MB Trattoria and it was some of the best gnocchi I have every had (I travel to Italy frequently). I am still craving the gnocchi.", "Service and valet were both excellent. We came to stay on a busy weekend. There were a couple of weddings and a half-marathon event happening so the hotel was very busy. The staff seemed to take it all in stride and provided excellent service for us. When we checked out, there was a huge mob at the valet so we expected to have to wait a while for our car, but they had it ready for us in a matter of minutes. Bed was comfy and bathroom was spacious, but might have preferred a double sink. Movies on demand were expensive at $15.00. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance. Cookies and milk before bed was a nice treat! We would definitely stay here again.", "If you are having a conference consider having it at the Magnolia. I attend / speak at many conferences and the food is typically ...well, typically conference type food. The conference meals at Magnolia were memorable! Very good. When at the Houston location take a trip up to the workout room. Not to workout though...there you will find an access door to the roof top pool that offers the best night sky view of Houston that you will ever see. We ended up having our breakout group discussions on the roof top in the evening as the ambience was so great. The rooms are very spacious...and the bathrooms are larger than my condo (all relative ofcourse as I live in NY).You will enjoy your stay...", "I decided on The Magnolia based on reviews. I have to say they were right on. I really can't say anything bad about it. I stayed there NYE for a concert that was at the House of Blues. The location couldn't have been better. I was able to walk back after the concert. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I was able to get in to my room early which was great for an afternoon nap. Plus the curtains were able to block out all light. The room was beautiful! I didn't feel like I was staying in a hotel at all. Very modern decor. The bathroom was also very updated. Huge roman tub. The bed was comfortable and great pillows. I was very pleased with room service. I recommend the pizza. Elevators were slow but it was a very busy night/day and most who were checking out on New Years Day were doing so right at check-out time. This didn't make my stay any less wonderful. I would definitely stay here again.", "My wife and I stayed here for 5 days during a recent International Quilting Convention. The location was perfect. We could walk to the convention center and many of the downtown restaurants. I expecially enjoyed the oversized room as I spent a lot of time there working during the day. The room and bathroom were clean and neat and bed was comfortable. The free morning breakfast buffet was also a bonus as service was fast. The free wine and beer in the evening seemed to be a big hit. The only minor complaint was the hotel seemed to be understaffed. But, perhaps the big conventions in town taxxed their services. We'll definitely stay here again when we return to Houston.", "On arrival, staff were welcoming; we had completed pre-arrival check in via internet so expected we'd avoid lines to get our key, etc, but not so. There was a long line. Once we had the key cards, staff got us and our luggage to our room, valet-parked the car. Our room was spacious and comfortable. I am disabled and found the height of the bed a problem--really high! We were in Houston for a family wedding and didn't get to do the happy hour or evening cookies, etc. Lobby was a comfortable place to visit with family members. Breakfast provided a wide range of choices and food was delicious and plentiful! If we are back in Houston, we'd look forward to staying in the Magnolia!.", "Wonderful hotel in the heart of downtown Houston. The staff is excellent, from the valet station, to the front desk, to the lounge, and all points in between. They were all professional, helpful, and created a relaxed atmosphere for their guests. The lobby and lounge have very pleasing sleek, modern decor. The lounge on the second floor seems to be the heart of the operation, serving breakfast (which was fabulous), evening cocktails, and late night milk and cookies. The rooms are spacious, quiet, and well-appointed. The car service available for guests to and from points downtown is most convenient! And there is a multitude of places to eat or hang out in the evening. Note: There is a charge for use of the business center, except to print boarding passes.", "We had received a 50% off coupon last Christmas after bringing toy donations to the Magnolia for a local charity during a holiday stay there. We decided to take the boys for a local getaway before the start of school. We had a suite room with a kitchenette which was ideal. The lounge now has a dinner menu so we enjoyed the wine reception as well as dinner. The pool and hot tub on the roof were very relaxing for all of us. Then back to the lounge for nightcaps and cookies and milk at the evening reception. The beds were so comfortable as always and the kids enjoyed watching TV from the sleeper sofa. The breakfast buffet was fresh, hot, and plentiful. All of our service was great as always. This is my favorite place to stay.", "I stayed at the Magnolia and arrived expecting to not be impressed. However, I was really very pleasantly surprised. The room was a good size and very nicely appointed, especially the bathroom. The room was very quiet and I did not hear other people's doors slamming, which seems to happen in other hotels sometimes. Things were in good condition and the staff was always courteous and attentive. The one minor negative would be that the included breakfast buffet is not really all that convenient to the seating area, but that really is minor. I made use of the hotel car to travel back and forth to the convention center several times. They were very prompt. All in all, I thought that the Magnolia is an excellent hotel and a tremendous value.", "Spent the weekend of 01/06 in Houston at the Magnolia hotel. Stayed previously at the Icon. It was bought by Marriott and I prefer smaller companies. The magnolia is fresh, a bit modern yet homey. Our room 1818 was large with a king bed, a sofa, chair and 42 flat screen. It also had a cooking area and separate dressing area. A large closet with in room safe. Cocktail hour, cookies and milk and a hot buffet breakfast were all included and above average. There are many local eateries and drinking holes within walking distance. You can park on street from 7pm-7am and all day Sunday across the street no charge. The light rail is two blocks up. It runs to museum distrct and out to reliant. If flying into Houston rent a car...you can score a deal for less than $50/weekend and roundtrip cab from airport is $100! The only disappointment was they ran out of white chocalate and macadamia nut cookies.", "We stayed at the Magnolia for a couple of nights as part of a weekend package deal. It was a very nice hotel. We had a king suite which had a kitchenette and a little living room area...and the room was very large and clean. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The roof top pool area was very nice and had a great view...we had the best view of the pre July 4th fireworks from the stadium. The breakfast was included but it was not the greatest and could be improved upon...the selection was small and the food wasn't that good...even the breads and rolls didn't seem very fresh. On a scale of 1-10 I'd give breakfast a 3. But they offered free coffee, tea, milk and freshly baked cookies every evening and it was great!!!! If I ever go to Houston again I wouldn't hesitate to stay at The Magnolia.", "The Magnolia is a very good boutique hotel option in downtown Houston. I like to stay in non-chain hotels when I travel for personal reasons as opposed to your standard Marriott, Hilton, etc. This fit the bill. It was walking distance from Minute Maid and a short ride/slightly longer walk to the Pavilion for dining and night life.I had a group doing a guys weekend and we booked the Ross Sterling Presidential Suite which was an excellent room. It had to have been around 1,500 sq ft and very easily fit four guys. There was a great deal of common space with a full size dining room, living room, and kitchen which allowed plenty of room to hang out in between different outings we were taking.All in all, a very enjoyable stay and a really good hotel.", "I travel about four or five times a year for business for a week at a stretch and this was one of the best hotel experiences I've had. Located in the business district of Houston, the room was clean and comfortable and the ammenities made the stay really special. These include complimentary wireless (12 free hours); two-drink happy hour; cookie buffet, and warm breakfast. Because the dowtown area can get a little dull at night, the hotel offers a complimentary van service that will take you to any of the restaurants or attractions listed on their downtown map. You can also get a great view of the city at night from the rooftop whilst enjoying a swim in the pool or dip in the jacuzzi. The hotel is compact, but affords the traveler with many comforts. Staff were all friendly and helpful and the room is clean and comfortable. King size bed, basic cable service, coffee maker, etc. The shower had awesome pressure and the water was always hot! Great soap and shampoo...overall, just a dynamite hotel that had me feeling fresh and ready to tackle the Houston heat and humidity in July!", "A little dissapointed that only wired was offered complimentary in the rooms, but nice to have it on the lounge level anyway. The shuttle driver and bellman on Monday morning were exceptional. Billy, the bartender, was SENSATIONAL. I would come back to the hotel just for his amazing hospitality, personality and service. I liked the happy hour, but would have liked a cheese and cracker pairing option. Beds were very, very comfy and the bathroom was great - the shower/tub were a very nice design. Loved the lotion in the bathroom (you'd be surprised how many hotels miss this). The eggs on Monday morning for breakfast were THE best hotel eggs I've ever had. LOVED the cookies and milk in the evening - what a brilliant idea! The rooftop view (and accesibility) were the WINNER of this stay for me. Thank you for offering this to the guests. I felt very cared for during my stay. Great staff.", "This hotel rocks. Complimentary shuttle service, American breakfast , cocktails in the evening, cookies at night, power workout room and just a real feeling of warmth. Very non-descript outdoor entrance in the middle of downtown. But inside, was wonderful and inviting. It is very close to many eating establishments. If you are looking for a shopping hotel, I would look elsewhere as there are limited fine stores in the downtown area, but for business it is a no-brainer. Parking is $25.00 a night. I was there during the week and on the weekend. OMG some of the most beautiful people were staying for weddings and dinners. Views of the downtown were quite nice and there is a church across the street for those that desire. The pool is on the roof and is far from olympic size, but the workout room is comp and is quite top notch. Don't forget the comp shuttle service within 10 miles.", "We stayed here this past weekend to go to Minute Maid Park to see the Astros vs. Red Sox game. It is very close to the ball park. The lobby is really nice and we had good customer service from the front desk. We also had great customer service from the valets. They are really nice and helpful and fast. Our room was really nice. It was by the elevators on the 14th floor so we were worried, but it was a very quiet room. The breakfast in the morning has scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries, cereal, lots of fruit, etc. It is a very nice breakfast. We really enjoyed staying here and found it very convenient for the things we wanted to do in Houston. The only issue was the slowness of the elevators. There was a wedding in the hotel and also a lot of baseball fans, so that might have impacted the elevators. There is a pool and a gym up on the roof and the roof has nice views of Houston and the ball park.", "I wasn't expecting this hotel to be great. I was even hesitant to say the name of the hotel when my coworkers asked where we were staying. It turned out that this is one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. We couldn't check in early but that was just fine because they have a big lobby where you can just surf the internet using the hotel's WiFi (free if you are a Kimpton member). The internet connection is great as I was using that to connect to a VPN when I have to work from the hotel. I like that I can easily walk to the red line to go to the loop. Good restaurants are only a few blocks away. Same with the Magnificent Mile. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel.", "Great from the start. Our cab pulled up and although we were early, they gave us a room. Check-in was smooth and we recieved a wonderful room. The room service was pretty good also. The location is great. Everything is within walking distance. They do have a licensed smoking patio and you can bring your own alcohol or get it from the bar/restaurant located in the hotel. It's nice to people watch and relax.....especially when raining. Chicago is very clean and same goes for this hotel. The outside terrase located on the upper floor was misleading a bit, as it isnt as big as I thought it would be and there wasn't much out there. There is also a great breakfast place that the hotel recommended. Would I stay here again??? Most definitely :))", "My daughter and I spent just one night at the Kimpton's Palomar Hotel and, I for one, was sold! Even though they have hundreds of customers on a daily basis, they treated me as if they personally knew me. Everything was clean, tasteful, and friendly!The hotel is centrally located near north Michigan ave and the river north area. Directions to anywhere are readily available from the front desk. Sable, the Hotel's restaurant was, for a hotel restaurant, very nice with an appealing menu. The breakfast buffet is also pretty good. I wish I could have bought a dozen bran muffins as they were wonderful!! ( a crispy top with a soft center)Now that I have found the Palomar in Chicago, I won't stay anywhere else when visiting!", "We had an excellent experience staying at the Palomar Hotel in Chicago. It is very conveniently located and you can walk to many places. The hotel is quite new and well designed. The rooms are not large but more than adequate and the beds are probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Except for fire or ambulance sirens, the city sounds did not disturb our slumber. The staff were very friendly and especially helpful in getting us tickets or making arrangements for a marvelous boat trip on the Chicago River. Loved the wine and nibbles in the late afternoon!Also enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast and dinner one night. There's an absolutely gorgeous pool up high and looking out over the city but unhappily we didn't have bathing suits!", "We are big fans of Kimpton Hotels and the Palomar is no exception. The location is great, being convenient to Clark Street restaurants, Michigan Avenue shopping, the river, the Red Line and the Loop. And like all Kimptons we've stayed at, the Palomar has its own style, has a friendly and helpful staff, is pet friendly, has a wine hour each day, and is reasonably priced. (We used to stay at the Peninsula but now see no reason to spend all that extra money.). They really know how to do it right.However, because each Kimpton has its own unique personality, we may try the Monaco, Burnam or Allegro the next time we are in Chicago depending on our itinerary. It's fun looking forward to a stay in a new one.", "There is no doubt the hotel design is beautiful. However, with such an expectation sometimes comes an \"uppity\" staff. Thank goodness, not here! Flew in from Texas for my father's 75th birthday. Growing up as a resident in Chicago one is not surprised the locals are friendly, but landing in a posh hotel like the Palomar expectations still might be swayed. We were pleasantly surprised by all of the staff who, although maintaining their roles, still went out of their way to make sure we felt welcomed and were accommodated. Special thanks to the early staff at the Sable Kitchen & Bar who took care of my coffee between service times; for Bleu, the front doorsman, who was always up for conversation as well as helping find the night's agenda and a special thanks to Colby at the front desk. He was not only attentive, but creative and has a great sense of humor. We'll never forget the champagne surprise. Thank you very much Colby! Palomar is lucky to have you. P.S. The animal print robes - totally awesome! Great touch.", "Staff was excellent, very helpful.Hotel is clean and centrally located.Street noise, fire engines in particular, might be an issue for light sleepers.Restaurant in the hotel was great, ate there twice.Room was large enough to stretch out on the floor, which I like to do after a long day.Each floor had different art work opposite the elevator doors, so as the doors opened on each floor, you got a brief view of some new art.Concierge very helpful, got tickets to sold out Second City performance for us.Recommend the river architecture tour.If you plan on going to any of the more renowned dining establishments, be sure to reserve ahead of time. Some restaurants were booking several weeks (or more), in advance.Had a very special dinner at Takashi restaurant, highly recommended.Oh, the hotel has a wine tasting every evening in the lobby area, a nice touch. You can actually have a nice social time with other travelers, compare experiences,etc.Overall, we had a great time in Chicago and enjoyed our stay at the Palomar Chicago.", "We recently spent 3 nights at the Palomar hotel. This was almost perfect. First, a great location close to the Magnificent Mile and close to the Chicago River. Next door, you find plenty of good restaurants, bars and jazz clubs. It's a kind of boutique hotel with great staff. Very efficient, very customer minded and very helpfull. The room was quite large, with a nice view over the city on the 17th top floor. We had a corner room....There is a pool and a gym at the same floor with scenic views . Breakfast is good and lobby bar is very popular and seems trendy. There is a free wine reception every evening. A place to recommend and great value for money.", "This was our first trip to Chicago. We splurged a little and stayed at the Palomar, and it was worth every penny! We absolutely loved it. The room was spacious, and clean. We stayed in the deluxe spa room, and again it was worth the extra money. The room was big, the bathroom with whirlpool/hot tub was clean and inviting. Even the location of this place was great, a block off Michigan, and surrounded by lots of stores and restaurants. But the best part of pur stay without question was the SERVICE. Anything you need, the concierge at the Palomar has you covered. Bobby was the gentleman that took care of us, and he was fantastic. He got us in for breakfasts, dinners, and even entertainment that was unavailable on our own. And everywhere we went, people greeted us like they knew we were coming. If you're staying in Chicago, you can't go wrong at the Palomar!!", "This was our first Palomar hotel and it certainly won't be our last. Also it was our first trip to Chicago and we fell in love with them both....We were lucky to be on the 17th floor and our room was fantastic- large, modern and spotlessly clean.The staff at the Palomar were first class, polite and always ready to help. Special mention of Mark on the front desk who always met us with a smile.Attached to the hotel, the bar was was lively and great fun on an evening. Breakfast served in the attached restaurant was fresh, tasty and first class. Location wise, Michigan Avenue was only a short walk away and there were lots of great restaurants nearby.It was also our first experience of the Palomar's 'wine hour' which was a lovely touch. How many hotels invite you to join them for a free class of wine???My party all agreed we would definitely return to Chicago in the future and we wold stay no where else.", "The car door closes, the doorman takes your bag, and you're whisked from the city into the marble-floored lobby. As is the case with all the staff at this hotel, the receptionist was extremely friendly, even going so far as to use her rusty French with my boyfriend who was in town visiting at the time. As is the case with all hotels, it's really the small touches that make a stay truly great: the silent elevator, the 'raid pass' ($10 credit for the mini-bar given to Kimpton In-Touch members), the personalized message center on the TV, and the hand-crafted soaps. I'm always happy to meet the management of any hotel I stay at, and this is possible during the Wine Hour offered daily. I've stayed in many other hotels offering free drinks in the lobby, but this is the only perfect execution of it I've seen. The goal is to offer a social outlet, a feeling of community, to its guests and that is exactly what it does.", "We hosted our first training meeting in Chicago at this hotel. It did not disappoint in any way. The area has unlimited activities, restaurants, sporting events, shopping, and architecture. The public spaces are clean and pedestrian friendly. From the moment our staff checked in it was apparent that the hotel places a high priority on customer service with a helpful, can-do attitude. The staff of the hotel was always on hand and the General Manager came by our registration area to introduce himself and to be available for questions. Our primary sales contact came by multiple times during the day to check on things, and the banquet staff was on-task, available, and extremely friendly. Our AV tech was certainly among the very best with whom we've ever worked. We had 80 guests on property and there was NOT ONE reservation or service issue with the rooms. Even better: the internet quality and speed. Make sure to sign up for the Kimpton loyalty program because then the internet is free.", "Wow! Where to start? The location is fabulous with dining, shopping, and access to the Red Line just outside your door. We were in Chicago for our annual girls trip, and The Palomar was the perfect hotel to serve as our home away from home. The rooms were well appointed and comfortable. The wine hour was the perfect ending to the day/begining to our night. I want to give a special shout out to the bell man, Bleu. He went out of his way to assist us with directions for the L train, getting a cab, and even recommended a great Sushi restaurant for our last night in town. Always stay at a Kimpton when traveling, and will surely return to the Palomar on my next trip to Chicago!", "I don't know if it's the good location, the comfortable room, the professional staff or the attached Sable Kitchen and bar, but.. (alright, it is the Sable bar. That place has an amazing selection of well-chosen distilled spirits, a staff of talented and friendly bartenders and some very tasty appetizers). The hotel rooms themselves are nice; very comfortable and clean. While I wish the bathroom doors were once that closed with a resounding CLICK rather than a barn-door slide, The bathrooms themselves are well appointed. We opted to stay at another (non-Palomar) hotel on our last visit to Chicago and were disappointed (and somehow managed to find ourselves back at Sable for cocktails anyway).I think this is not just my favorite hotel in Chicago, but my favorite Kimpton overall.", "My husband and I stayed at Hotel Palomar for three nights the Weekend of the Chicago Marathon, which he ran. From the time we checked in until we checked out, the staff was friendly, professional and helpful. They were very familiar with the marathon and eager to help us figure out where we needed to be and how to get there. The room was nice, clean and comfortable. We enjoyed both the complementary cocktail hour in the evening and their delicious coffee in the morning, in the living room. The hotel also put out a complementary breakfast of fruit, granola, Gu packs, juice and water for the runners the morning of the marathon. The hotel is in a perfect location just a few blocks from the Magnificent Mile and right next to a Red Line stop on the transit system. As an added bonus for me (marathon spectator), the marathon passed right in front of the hotel. We definitely plan to stay here again the next time we find ourselves in Chicago.", "We have stayed at several Kimpton hotels and we were anxious to try this hotel after the great reviews on TA. All the reviews appear to be on target. The service at the front desk is outstanding and the restaurant does not disappoint. We were on standby for an upgrade and got an extra upgrade for the same price as the basc upgrade which put us in a one bedroom suite. We were very impressed with the lay out and the comfort of the room. We have to thank Gad at the front desk for his professionalism and his friendliness. The service was fantastic. We truly felt the hospitality from everybody from the doorman to the workers we shared the elevator with. The rooftop terrace was nice for relaxing and taking pictures. We enjoyed the quietness of the hotel. The location was superb. We anjoyed meeting people at the wine happy hour. Don't hesitate from making a reservation at this contemporary haven!", "This was our first stay at the Palomar, but we have stayed at other Kimpton hotels in the city. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. My kids (6 and 8) love Kimpton hotels because they are fancy but kid friendly. The gift bags on check in and the goldfish (named Goldie!) in our room made them feel special. A child size robe was sent up for my daughter! We did not complete the scavenger hunt because we ran out of time. My family also enjoyed the pool. The lighting and view was so cool at night. The rooms are quiet and comfortable. The location is great. Easy walk to Michigan Avenue. We love Kimpton Hotels, and we will return to Palomar in the future!", "My first time at a Kimpton Hotel and it will not be my last. Distinctive Hotel with unique Kimpton touches. Staff and service were outstanding. A special acknowledgement to Elias who was cleaning the \"living room\" at 4:30 am. I asked about coffee at that hour and he immediately proceeded to leave the hotel to buy me coffee at the local 7-11 with his own money. He was stopped by the front desk clerk who noted there was coffee in the kitchen. Elias led me there, served me my coffee with cream. Wow! that is service. Great location to walk to Marshall Fields/Macy's, The Art Institute, Millennium Park and scores of restaurants. We shall return. Excellent Job Kimpton and special thanks Elias!", "Stayed here two nights with a friend. This hotel can really be recommended! The staff is friendly and we did not encounter any problems, top notch service from everyone we met! Got a corner room on the 15th floor with view to the river and a glimpse of Michigan Avenue. The room were large and clean, the beds were good, and they even made our beds for the evening! No problems with noice from the street, neither from the hall or other rooms. As an Inner Circle member we also received a very nice welcome treatment :-)I think the bathroom was small, but the door was easy-gliding and the amenities were good. I also found the pool (located at the top floor!) to be somewhat cold.We participated on the wine hours which were nice, and we also borrowed bikes and went for a ride a long the lake. A very nice ride!", "This was our first visit to Chicago and chose the palomar because of the good reviews, we'd stayed at kimpton hotels before and it was reasonably priced. The location of the hotel was great, very close to michigan avenue and lots of great restaurants nearby. Although the staff were nice, they weren't as friendly as in other kimptons we've stayed in. The decor was quite tired and not of the standard we've experienced in other kimptons. Room was very clean and spacious. We had a few drinks in sable which was lively and had a good atmosphere. We received breakfast vouchers for sable on arrival which was unexpected but very much appreciated- small breakfast of bagel and fruit but enough for us. Overall I would recommend this hotel and stay here again because of location and value for money but decor could do with a freshen up.", "My husband and I have recently returned from a five day vacation in Chicago (our new favorite city) and one of the highlights was our stay at the Kimpton Palomar. The hotel is perfectly situated for easy walking to River North, Millenium Park, Michigan Ave and a myriad of fabulous restaurants--- public transportation to the airport, Wrigley Field and the Steppenwolf Theater is a block away. What we loved about the Palomar were the amazingly helpful and gracious staff, the spacious, clean room, the delicous coffee available (with a paper) early in the morning and the wine hour at the end of the day that allowed us to meet others who were passing through the city. There is nothing about this hotel that doesn't deserve a five star rating.", "I booked this hotel on hotel.com. The staff is super friendly from the get go. Some places are less welcoming when they know you booked your stay on any of the\" deal sites\" but the receptionist was super professional and pleasant. He even got my two kids a goodie bag. The room is modern and comfortable. It smelled a little musky at first but perhaps I got used to it. The best thing is the free Internet. For a luxury hotel, it's very unusual to have this great benefit. All you do is to sign up for free to become a Kimpton member and voila, unlimited wi fi. The pool on the top floor was a nice touch although I wish they had a hot tub. The minus side of this hotel which I am willing to put up with is the lack of coffee maker in th room. They have a large pot downstairs of high quality coffee. There's a starbucks around the corner and the NYC bagel deli is on Dearborn, just a block west of the hotel. I would come back again.", "From beginning to end my experience at the Kimpton, Hotel Palomer in Chicago was far beyond my expectations. I am a believer that your stay starts as soon as you check in. Jake at he front desk made all of my dreams come true when it comes to hospitality! The rooms are cozy and clean, large too for a city room. The view from my room was breathtaking, the Chicago skyline is more than I imagined. Jake also took note that it was my finance's birthday weekend and sent up s special something for us one of the evenings. Thank you for taking hospitality to another level!I sent several days at the hotel as I was there during the week for business and ate in the adjoining restaurant, Sable for breakfast each morning and 3 nights for dinner. Fred, the mixologist, was a joy and extremely talented with his knowledge. The food was fantastic. The server Phil who waited on me each morning for breakfast, made my day! He was so welcoming and attentive, all in all I cannot wait to come back to Chicago and I will be staying at the Hotel Palomer again!", "I stayed with friends at the Palomar htel for 3 nights in May 2012 during our stay in Chicago.Upon arrival, we immediately felt the warm atmosphere in the entrance hall. Receptionists were very welcoming and quick; the room was on a high level floor with a view as per our online reservation request. Professionalism and efficiency.We were invited to share a wine glass in the comfy lobby as they do wine tasting events some evenings.The room was very nice: spatious, intelligently designed, modern, excellen beds and fee wireless internet. What could we asked more for?The location of the htel is good; we walked to every part of the city. No need to take a cab or the aerial metro (except for the experience).We received good advices for breakfast outside the htel at the reception.The staying was perfect!", "I stayed at the Palomar for the third time the end of August. The service is impeccable. The location between Michigan Avenue, the Loop, and River North, can't be beat. I arrived before at 9:15 AM, within 30 minutes they had a room ready for me. Everyone from the front desk, to housekeeping, to room service, went out of their way to see everything was taken care of. Mark, the concierge, has to be the best in Chicago. He remembers the guest names, and all the suggestions he made proved to be top notch. He makes everyone feel they are his number one priority. I originally stayed at he Palomar because it was ranked in the top 2 on tripadvisor (and still feel it should hold the first or second position). It compares to any 5 star hotel in it's level of service. I travel to Chicago often and will continue to stay there.", "This was the first time I had stayed in Chicago overnight, despite living in a fairly close suburb. This was definitely the right place to stay. The staff were exceptionally nice, and the rooms were some of the cleanest and well kept I've ever stayed in. The breakfst buffet is pretty good. The beds were not at all uncomfortable, and I had a good night's sleep all three nights of our stay. The location is great (very close to Michigan Ave.), and even if you don't like to walk around, there are plenty of things to do at the hotel including an indoor swimming pool and an outdoor patio with an amazing view of the skyline. This is a great place to stay while visiting Chicago.", "The Hotel Palomar definitely lived up to its reviews. Even before arriving the customer service was excellent, I received an e-mail a day prior to our arrival asking if we were celebrating anything special and/or needed reservations, etc. I replied as we were celebrating our 1-year anniversary and needed dinner reservations, shortly thereafter I received an e-mail wishing us a Happy Anniversary and confirming our reservations. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a bigger room (as they had the availability) and a few hours later we received a bottle of Champagne with Strawberries and Chocolate to dip them in. Additionally, as Kimpton InTouch members we received free in-room WiFi and a $10 Mini Bar Credit. There is a 1-hour complimentary Happy Hour in the lobby every evening, which was really nice (White and Red Wine as well as Sangria). The hotel also provides complimentary bike rentals on a first come, first served basis. The room was very clean and all of the staff was more than happy to help with anything we needed. All of this combined with a great location makes the Hotel Palomar a great choice for your Chicago stay.", "This was a last minute booking that turned out perfect for our family of four. We got into Chicago a little later than planned but were so surprised at this hotel, it's staff, it's cleanliness and it's amenities. We missed the free cocktail hour but by simply stating this fact the front desk took it on themselves to offer free wines coupons for the bar. The 17th floor patio had nice background music to enjoy our free wine while the kids swam indoors right next door. Late night milk and warm chocolate chip cookies were ordered from room service and free continental breakfast which we brought up to the rooftop patio. Overall we were very well taken care of in an excellent location. BONUS: They allow dogs. We will take advantage of this on our next trip.Sorry below. I did not use the spa and clicked inadvertently.", "A lot of the reviews here talk about the great customer service and now I know why. When we checked in, we were asked if we were staying for business or pleasure and I said it was our anniversary! The person checking us in congratulated us and said some niceties and then we went on our way. Not even 10 minutes later, there was a knock on the door. Bobby, the concierge, had sent up a bottle of wine with a really nice note saying congratulations and to enjoy the chorizo stuffed dates at Avec (where I had mentioned we were dining later that night). It was SO nice and unexpected. I was honestly floored. I think that type of experience really sums up how all of the staff is at this Palomar. They are accommodating, really nice, always friendly, etc. We will definitely be staying again, hopefully at this location when life brings us back to Chicago.", "As has been my experience with Kimpton hotels, the Palomar Chicago didn't disappoint. Even before our arrival, the customer service was superb! We were upgraded to a corner room which was very quiet and roomy with additional windows. The room was spotless and beautifully furnished and the bed was comfortable . Requests for a coffee maker in the room and a mini-fridge were accommodated in a timely fashion. The lobby, lounge and front desk area were all stunning in a 'zen' way. Ice water with lemon was provided daily as was the wine hour complete with sangria! All the staff were very helpful but I'd particularly like to give kudos to Sari, Jake and Bobbie [concierge]. Finally the hotel has a wonderful location and we were able to walk to all the sights we wanted to see. There are many restaurants and shops close by. The breakfast buffet is pretty good. I am a Kimpton Loyalty member and my experience at The Palomar in Chicago only reinforced why I always like to stay at a Kimpton whenever I travel!!!", "We stayed for 8 nights and everything was wonderful. The hotel is very well maintained and the staff is quite attentive. They made recommendations for restaurants, attractions, best times to do things, etc. The kids loved having their own robes and a pet goldfish for the week. Each kid also received a welcome gift bag. They liked going to the evening reception and getting their \"mocktail\"- which was just a juice box but it was still nice they felt included. The bathroom was really nice with large mirrors, plenty of amenties, and never a shortage of towels. The location is wonderful with plenty of restaurants within a few blocks. You are in walking distance of many major attractions including Magnificient Mile, Hancock Tower, Lincoln Park Zoo, and the Navy Pier (although there is a free shuttle with a stop right across the street from the hotel). Staying in downtown Chicago is a little pricey no matter where you stay- Palomar goes out of their way to ensure you feel you are getting your money's worth.", "Kimpton does things right. Chic up to date decor. Well appointed rooms. CLEAN clean clean. The service stands out. All the staff we ran into went above and beyond to make us and our two kids, 10 and 7, feel special and welcome. Kids got a re-usable gift bag at check-in with yo-yo's, beach ball, scavenger hunt to complete and turn in for a prize. A very nice touch and much appreciated. The location was perfect for us. 10 to 30 minute walks to most parts of the city including Millenium Park, Water Tower/Hancock Center, Lincoln Park/Zoo, Navy Pier. Lots and lots of restaurant options close to hotel. Navy Pier runs a free shuttle that goes down State street. Hop on and off that to save some walking if you like. The indoor pool was a nice treat after a hot day but it is on the smaller side and the water was quite chilly but we enjoyed it and the views from the 17th floor are nice. Had breakfast twice at their restaurant, Sable. Great food, decently priced and food came out very quickly.", "Sadly only a one night stay at the wonderful Palomar but I loved it. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful; one porter even found the address of my next destination without me asking, in order to advise the taxi, which was much appreciated. Our room was gorgeous on the end of the hall with dual aspect windows flooding the room with natural light - a rare treat in a hotel room. The decor was pleasant and serene. The doors were heavy and sound proof, the bed was like a cloud and the bathroom nicely appointed too. The pool and roof terrace were also nice and the free coffee in the lobby was appreciated. The location is great, right on State St., less than a block to the Grand CTA on the red line, a few blocks to Michigan Ave and a few blocks to State St. shops; Macys etc. Doubt I could afford the full room rate and it was a treat at a hotwire price of GBP160 but hope I have the chance to stay there again! Joining the Kimpton loyalty programme gives you free wifi too which is appreciated.Highly recommended.", "2 couples with 2 kids ages 6 and 12 for a Chicago getaway..absolutely outstanding service from the moment we walked in the door until the time we checked out.Obviously the staff loves their jobs as everyone has a smile on their face and ready to help you out with anything you may need whether it be an in house request(extra sheets for the kids to make a fort,or scissors for crafts) or room service for the kids wanting \"smores\" ice cream sandwiches..you can not feel more comfortable at The Palomar.. The restaurant Sable was a unique experience with a menu that introduces you to the areas fresh produce,meat and cheese of the region.Nice to see a chef that uses the local land to produce such amazing dishes! The Terrace on the 17th floor is a very nice touch where you can chill while the kids swim in the pool.definitely a must is a stay at The Palomar..Kudos to the GM and all the staff,from check in to housekeeping,room service,bell desk,concierge!! My new favourite Chicago hotel!!", "this hotel was amazing. EVERYONE that worked there Loved their job and actually seemed happy about being there. from the moment we drove up to the moment we had to leave we were perfectly taken care of. the staff is very knowledgeable of the area and have lots of recommendations. we were offered a beverage upon arrival and then given a glass of vino and some h20. i can not remember the name of the man that helped us in ( jean ?) he was so warm and personable. lots of great suggestions on his part as far as places to go and places to see. when we left the door man was so much fun to talk to - said he loved his job and was happy to come to work each day. thought my daughter was 12 when in reality she is 26. and he meant it. sincere people with great work ethics. i have stayed many places in chicago - this being my first at the palomar ( it won't be my last ) and this is my favorite so far. great location great value and a more than wonderful staff.", "We have just returned from 6 nights in this lovely hotel. The staff were so welcoming and nothing was too much trouble, from the front desk staff to the restarant and room service staff.The hotel is in a central location with excellent restaurants in this area, it is situated about 10 minutes stroll from the Magnificant Mile for all the wonderful shopping, An excellent light breakfast was included and a wine hour is provided between 5 and 6pm in the lobby. Also in the lobby, there was always infused water available during the day and coffee and tea is provided in the mormings..Morning papers were available at the front desk and the toiletries provided were really nice. The bed was very comfortable and we had undisturbed sleep. Although we have stayed in several Kimpton Hotels this was one of the best and our stay was perfect.", "My mom and I recently stayed 3 nights at Hotel Palomar and were greeted with smiling faces and engaging staff. Everything at this hotel was beyond what I expected: happy, helpful staff, clean room and bathroom, comfortable bed, which included lots of pillows and soft linens, lots of towels, complimentary wine hour (Yum!), and good location to all attractions. We did use public transit to get to Millenium Park to go Taste of Chicago since it's a little over a mile away. The red line is near the hotel, as well as a bus stop to take you there. The shopping on State St. is a 15 min walk and there are lots of great restaurants in walking distance also. I left some valuables in the safe when we checked out and within a couple hours I received a phone call saying they had my things. I was very grateful for the honesty and trustworthiness of the staff. I will definitely be staying here again for future Chicago trips and would look into other Kimpton Hotels elsewhere.", "This is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed at. The Palomar offers everything you need and more in a great location. Staff are super-friendly and helpful, the room was modestly sized but well equipped and luxurious. The hotel offers lots of little perks: jogging with a manager, complimentary coffee in the morning, complimentary flavoured water (usually lemon) throughout the day, a happy hour with wines and more, etc.The hotel has one of the loveliest pool areas on the roof, with a great terrace suitable for eating, sun tanning or just gazing.The hotel is also very well located - the subway is at the corner and it is a short walk to both the Magnificent Mile and its attractions as well as the Loop.I would definitely return.", "The hotel is ideally located in downtown Chicago. Easy walking distance to anything you'd want to explore. An extra plus is that you can take the train and subway from the airport and get off at a stop right across the street. Easy, easy.The staff, as with all Kimpton's, is friendly and helpful. Our room was very comfortable. What is outstanding at this location is the restaurant: Sable. The food is delicious and made with love. You can taste it. The wait-staff really enjoys working here and it shows. We were planning on visiting a lot of different restaurants, but kept coming back here because we just had to try another dish (or have seconds on the blueberry pie with roasted corn ice cream). Please, please check out the menu before going any where else. We enjoyed dining in the intimate outside \"patio\" by the dining-room (it's quiet if the noise of the popular bar is too much for you).", "First trip to Chicago for me and my husband and our first stay in a Kimpton hotel. After our experience at The Palomar, they have made two new customers for life. We arrived early in the morning and were graciously allowed to check in right away. Our room, 1115, was near an elevator and initially I wondered if we would hear it. No, not once, completely quiet. The hotel was especially busy and full and we never heard a thing in the hallway. Standard king room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. Robes were provided and toiletries were top notch. What truly elevated the Palomar was the level of customer service. We needed help with El trains, directions, reservations, as well as architectural tour and restaurant recommendations. Concierges Mark and Bobby and desk clerk Brandon were especially knowledgeable and helpful, providing us with a number of handy tips and tricks. We can't thank them enough for going above and beyond the call of duty. This was the best hotel stay of my life.", "While Starwood/Westin are obviously at their best in Asia or at resorts... This is a very nice property with a huge volume of guests passing through their attention to detail could be better in terms of wear and tear on the rooms - ours room 1229 had a big dent in the front door from the bathroom door handle and very low water pressure... But otherwise was very updated and has the signature Westin heavenly bed (so comfy we bought one for our home). The best feature of the property is their little used heated outdoor pool which I had mostly to myself for the afternoon... Lovely California style landscaping and beautiful palm trees... A mini oasis in the midst of LAX concrete", "The Westin is a very nice hotel in any case. However, the park and fly deal is fantastic. For about the price of a round trip shuttle from Orange County, we had a room for one night and parking for nine days. Our return flight arrived late at night and it was really appreciated that we just went to the hotel shuttle, which arrived in a few moments, and about 20 minutes later we were taking a hot shower in our room. After 14 ours of travel, the excellent mattress was REALLY appreciated. The next morning we had a nice breakfast in the Daily Grill before driving home. The staff at the desk and in the restaurant were all super friendly. The overall experience was excellent!", "Let me start by saying that those who gave this hotel a negative review must have some extremely high expectations. The room I was in was excellent. From the moment I arrived at the hotel, I was treated with the utmost respect. The staff was extremely helpful and even allowed me to check in early. The room did overlook a doggie kennel, but the dogs played during the day. There was no barking at night whatsoever. There's also a view of the city or the airport from the room. I didnt try the food, so i cant comment on it. I spent most of my time seeing the sites of LA. I've stayed in quite a few hotels, and this one is on the top of my list. to the staff, I thank you for a wonderful stay.", "We arrived here totally exhausted and jetlagged! Staff were very pleasant and accommodating. The room was large and airy and beautifully decorated. The king bed was one of the comfiest beds I''ve ever slept in! There was also plenty of room for your belongings, though as we were only staying one night we didn't unpack. Bathroom was also spacious and well equipped. Breakfast was contintental but a very good choice of dishes. We used the bar in the evening and it was ample for our requirements and has access to free internet. There is also a restaurant and a swimming pool, but we didn't used either. Location is about 5-10 mins in a free shuttle, which worked very well. Couldn't have asked for a better airport location. Would definately recommend for an airport stay.", "We had planned to stay at another Starwood resort but due to the fact that the other location had insane pet policy, we returned to the Westin LAX. This facility is staffed with friendly, efficient people who want you to enjoy your experience. Our room on the preferred guest level was quite large (no view, but it was only one night) with a sleeper loveseat that could have accommodated a child had we traveled with one. The room was clean, the bed was the \"heavenly\" bed we expect and appreciate. Room service was too us within 30 minutes and was excellent. Our small dog was made over by the staff who offered a special bed (she has her own) as well as other guests. It was like returning to the home of long-time friend.", "Stayed here for one night before making a connecting flight in the morning. Very elegant hotel with friendly staff. Room did not have a view but didn't need one. The two queen heavenly beds were very comfortable. It had coffee maker and a tray of snack food and bottled water you had to pay for. Got a great rate via internet web site at the last minute. Would have expected to pay a lot more for the quality of this hotel. I have stayed at other properties at LAX and this was the most grand and under $100 w/o taxes. Took the airport shuttle from LAX to hotel. It seemed like a long wait for the shuttle to get to hotel. No wait in the morning to get back to LAX. Would definitely stay at this property again.", "We spent in The Westin our last night of staying in California. Since our plane was in the morning, we wanted to be close to the airport. We decided to book the hotel through a site which offer several deals, therefore the price we paid was very low. We expected to get to a simple hotel, average quality, but we were totally wrong! When we arrived to the hotel we were very (and happily) surprised! The lobby is huge, the staff is lovely. They gave us a room on the 10th floor which is dedicated to preferred guests and gave us also access to the lounge. The room was very big, on top of that we had 2 Queen size beds! Everything was very clean, but the best part were the pillow and the bed itself: the best I have ever tried. Even though the hotel is very close to the LAX, we barely heard any plane. Since we were at the end of our honeymoon, they offered us the american breakfast served in the lounge. It is a very simple breakfast but offers everything you need.", "I was here for a few nights at the end of my holiday trying to get home (stand-by ticket). Whilst not happy to be stuck in LA this hotel made it a bit more pleasant. Had a room overlooking the runways the first couple of nights and loved watching the planes land. Yes you will get aircraft noise but I like that. It never kept me awake.The room service was good and we had many meals downstairs at the Daily Grill - the food was always good.The pool was great except one of the days some guests decided to come and hijack the pool - they were unruly and more of them and bigger than me, so I left. The shuttle to the airport is great.", "Stayed here for just one night on my way to Anaheim. I was upgraded to a Suite that had a master bedroom and a separate living room. The room looked a little dated but it was OK otherwise. I found the location convenient and the hotel staff was very helpful and gave me information about the close by attractions, that way I was able to go to Manhattan Beach using the cute shuttle that you can take right up the street from the Westin LAX. Overall a very good experience. Nice restaurant, good food and they have a band that plays live some nights a week. The check in was fast and the service was what I expected from this property.", "I am a frequent guest at this hotel, as it is the best that I have found at LAX. The check in procedure is quick, but friendly. I am able to get from the front desk to my room within 5 minutes of my arrival. Likewise, departure is also expedited as I can select to have my bill placed under the door, emailed to me, or both. Selecting the emailed option ensures that I automatically receive any updates to my bill without having to stop by the front desk (for the breakfast, etc. charged to the room). The restaurant is run by a third party, and though pricey for an airport hotel, offers a high quality product. For those of you who have not tried the heavenly bed, it is the best in the industry.", "I travel weekly to LAX and have tried many hotels by the airport. I finally found a hotel that I can depend on my comfort needs and excellent service, The Westin Hotel. I have stayed their many times and sometimes I travel their weekly for my personal and business trips for the past 2 years and have not been disappointed at all. The location is convenient and safe which is important to a business woman traveling alone and the check-in/check-out process is quick and easy. The hotel itself is comparable to all the Marriots (I have stayed there as well but prefer The Westin) and the Westin is better in quality and bigger. The price is un-beatable for the quality you are receiving.", "Stayed overnight at LAX and this hotel is great. Clean rooms with plenty of space. Very nice clean beds. Bathrooms were very clean and neat. Hall ways were clean, well lit, and quiet. Room service was quick and fantastic and did not \"stick it to you\" with the prices. The lobby bar is amazing! The staff was friendly and happy to make any kind of drink you may order. You can also eat at the bar. Service there is fast too. Shuttle to and from the airport is free and runs 24/7. All and all this was a great hotel. The only negative thing I can even think of is that you hear the planes taking off and landing all the time......but you ARE at the airport after all !!", "I am a Platinum member of the Starwood Preferred Guest Program, and I recently stayed in this lovely hotel. There were so many good things about this hotel that I hardly know where to start. The first was the amazing upgrade I received, to the Chairman's Suite. Their upgrade policy doesn't usually give such a generous upgrade (so don't complain if you don't get one like this!) so I was especially pleased to become Chairman for a day! I also liked the parking convenience (if not a little expensive) where you could park right at the back of the hotel in covered parking, and be in your room in a couple of minutes. What a great hotel, I recommend it to everyone.", "I recently had two overnight stays at this hotel. The first occasion I arrived from Australia at 8.30 in the morning and was absolutely delighted when I was able to book into my room immediately. It certainly makes a change when you are travelling to have hotels who are willing to let you book in early and not wait until 2pm or 3pm. The second overnight stay my flight back to Australia was not until 11.30pm. When I checked in for a reasonable charge I was able to stay until 6.00pm the day of departure. A friend stayed at a more well known hotel and wasn't given the option to stay after check out time. The staff throughout the hotel were courteous and friendly. The hotel has a courtesy bus to and from the airport which is wonderful for overseas travelers. There is also a bus stop just down the road which makes it easy and cheap to do some sight seeing and shopping", "I attended a four-day conference here, from 8AM until 7PM each day, sleeping only one night in the hotel since I live within 1 1/2 hours. The hotel was comfortable and the prices very reasonable, especially considering that it is a stone's throw from the airport. (Note that you LAX isn't pedestrian friendly, take the shuttle.)I really enjoyed the layout of the atrium/dining/bar area. It was a great place to network after the event or hang out with a couple of friends. The food at the Daily Grill ranged from good to excellent and the prices were reasonable. The breakfast buffet was a little pricey, but that's my only complaint. All in all, for a hotel close to a major airport this is a great deal.", "We had been dislocated from our residence and were in need of a nice place to stay until we could go back to our home. The Westin Los Angeles Airport Hotel personified what home away from home should be like. They did everything to make our stay wonderful when we had such awful worry and concern about our future living environment. They accommodated us in every way with a helpful and eager to please staff. All you had to do was ask and it was done. The price was reasonable too and it was a pleasure to be treated with such caring and compassion. It lived up to it's Four Star rating and we know we will be back, this time though, not because we have been dislocated but rather because we loved the exceptional accommodations.", "The other reviews about the long check in lines are true. However, once you have checked in everything else is great. The parking is expensive but everywhere you go in LA you have to pay to park, except TARGET! The hotel is realtive close to a Target and a grocery store so you don't have to drink the beverages nor eat their snack in the hotel room. They charge for that also. The customer service is the best I have seen in a long time. Do the breakfast at the hotel Daily Grill, it is great. The staff inside the Daily Grill was nice as well. Everyone had a smile on their faces and it seemed genuine. You could tell they really wanted to be there. I would stay here again, I think they could do better on the parking. Also, there is a parking garage less than 10 yards away that you can use for about 8 bucks a day. Also, they do not provide a shuttle to the beach as claimed on the web site. Two car rental places are next door and California was extremely easy to navigate without getting on the highways.", "On every business trip to Los Angeles, I have booked my hotel stays here at the Westin LAX on 5400 West Century Blvd. For hotel guests with Platinum SPG status, there is a \"clubhouse\" on the 12th floor, hosted by the beautiful, kind and courteous Mrs. Isabel. She is the perfect hostess, hands down. Front desk manager Shavonna Cadle has gone out of her way to assist me, 24/7. Truly!!!! With a quick email to Shavonna @ the Westin LAX, I have set up my hotel bookings for the next 3 months without a hitch. And there's Roy Lawrence, who has brought a smile to my face at every visit. Roy brings a new and exciting story about the \"music scene\" at every one of my visits when I was fortunate to see him at the front desk; he's a busy man, assisting so many guests, with a genuine smile to show that he cares...and he does. Westin LAX rocks!!! 100%", "This hotel gives you almost everything you need for a comfortable business visit near the airport: Clean, quiet rooms; fast room service; a surprisingly good restaurant and bar; and a free shuttle to and from LAX. Plus the price can't be beat.My room was clean, quiet and up to date. I could see plans landing at LAX, but I'm a New Yorker, and so I barely noticed the noise. The hotel is far enough from the runways that you shouldn't be bothered. I was a little concerned when I hear a barking dog in the early afternoon and was told that there's a kennel nearby, but the faint barking did subside by the evening. And I'm particularly sensitive to sound, so I would definitely have been bothered if it had continued.Room service was exceptionally fast and the restaurant offers more than the usual fare. The fish tacos are especially good. It's a bit pricey, though.My only complaint: More and more of the hotels I stay at for business offer free Wi-Fi, and this Westin should follow suit.", "We stayed in this hotel both in the arrival and the departure from LAX. The room was great, modern and spacious! The bed... well... it was an heavenly bed, so no need to say more! I wish I had one like that at home...Very efficient check-in and check-out in both times.The soundproofing was not perfect and we could hear some street noise. Nothing that could prevent from a good night sleep, using my ear plugs (I'm really a light sleeper; my husband could sleep perfectly without any problem).FIrst time we could use a Lobby PC with internet connection for free; second time internet was paid (I think $5.95 each 15 minutes). That is a pity and it is a service that all Starwood Hotels should provide for free (some already have it).If I would stay here again? No doubt I would!", "I travel across the Country often and stay at many beautiful hotels and resorts. I live in the Los Angeles area and when Im home sometimes I like to stay at a hotel just to relax and chill. Whenever I do this I try to stay at a Starwood member hotel such as Sheratons, Four Points, Le Meridien, Luxury Collection, St Regis and my favorite of all Westin Hotels.I try to stay at the Westin Los Angeles Airport as often as I can. The rooms are spacious, staff is courteous, and room rates are always completive. When I stay at the Westin Los Angeles Airport, its like being at home with family that you dont get enough time to see. If you are in the area and looking for a beautiful hotel near the airport consider the Westin Los Angeles Airport. Who knows I might just be their as well.", "Any negative comments you may read here about the LAX Westin are absent now- June '11. 5 nights. Ask for SPG level if you are able. No noise. Ask for more towels, hangers, the usual for more than 2 nite stays in any hotel. Ask for room facing Century Bl upper floors.1158 extra large space. Earn extra points by not asking for houskeeping every day. Daily News- lobby-- good menu and not outrageously expensive. Open late- 10:00pm. No restaurants walkable. Thrifty car rental next door. Don't try concierge recommended $5 parking blocks away in alley at the Subway. $18/$22 nite parking necessary. hotel $$--restaurant open late in lobby. Save $$- don't use room service unless you are on expense account. Forget mini bar with snacks. Garage confusing re: payment. See front desk. No cash attendants. 5 miles from terminals. Easy shuttle 24/7. Very good value. Popular convention hotel & weekend weddings. Best for SPG Starwood members.", "Stayed here on 2 separate occasions on my recent trip and was extremely happy with the quality of the rooms. I was actually pleasantly surprised as it had been awhile since I had stay at an airport hotel at LAX and was not expecting something so luxurious. The beds were extremely comfortable, the rooms were quiet and clean. The bathrooms were very clean with no sight of mould. I used room service on my first stay and even though I had arrived after 11pm the lovely girl on the telephone organised for me to be able to order something of the \"day menu\" which had ended. I was very appreciative. The staff are incredibly polite and efficient. I will definitely be staying here again next time I'm in LAX.", "It easy easy to spot coming off the 405 and driving up to the entrance was a breeze. We had a rental car and the return locations for all car rentals were just about 4blocks away. We gave our luggage to the bell captain and he directed us to the check in desk. We were given our room quickly and told the bellman the room number and went to our car and returned it, which took only a few minutes. The rental return clerk informed us that there was a complementary van to take us back to the Westin. We took it back to the hotel. At the Westin, just off the lobby, was a Daily Grill restaurant. We enjoyed some nice cocktails and wine, crab cakes and fresh angel hair pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil and garlic. The room was spacious and the windows were special so as to block out the airplane noise. Starbucks coffee was offered in the room. The bed was fantastic. We liked the hotel very much and would choose it again when if we were to return to the area.", "My husband was traveling back to Iraq after a 30 day R&R and the Westin was close to the LAX with shuttles running every 15 minutes. We had stayed at Westin's before and were in love with their Heavenly Bed, (it is, truly Heavenly) and the quality of the hotel. Before our arrival I received an e-mail from the Westin anticipating our arrival with some helpful information. Much to our surprise we saw that they allowed dogs. We have 2 Labs. We called and spoke to the manager (since our dogs were over the 40 lb. limit) and were told there would be no problem and she would make a note of it on our reservation. When we arrived we were greeted with a very friendly and helpful staff, from the Valet and Bellman to the Check-in Staff. We were all made to feel very Welcome and the dogs were a great hit with the staff and other guests. Our room was spacious with a great view and of course the bed was heavenly. We had great dinner in the Restaurant and ended our evening in the lounge. Our stay was delightful and we will definitely be back.", "After a long international flight and going through customs in Los Angeles the first flight that would take us back home was the following day. My husband and I decided to spend the night at the Westin Los Angeles Airport. Tired from a long trip with another flight the next day it was a pleasure to first have a very short wait for the shuttle to take us to the hotel. The inviting lobby was was clean and welcoming. The staff was friendly and helpful and quickly checked us in. The room was large, quiet and the bed was extremelly comfortable. I recommend this hotel as a great stop over while in LA or a convenient location to some of the area's main attractions.", "It's hard traveling with our 30-pound dog. We knew we would be at airports and in the air for 8-10 hours, and we really wanted an airport hotel where the three of us could relax (or collapse!) after our ordeal. Checking online, the Westin LAX seemed to be a good deal, since they did not charge extra for the dog. Turned out even better than we expected, and the price was more than fair for the service we received. Everybody was nice to the dog, from the shuttle driver to the bell staff to the front desk. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise -- we chose comfort food and a glass of good California red wine, and were served by a very professional waitress. Our room and bed were so comfortable that we were actually ready to continue with our travels the next morning!We will return -- this is a great airport hotel for making a complicated trip less complicated!", "I had the privilege of arranging the hotel for my son's wedding night. They were leaving for Hawaii the next day and needed to be near LAX. He visited the Westin LAX and others and this is the one he chose. I had to make these arrangements from out of state and so called the hotel directly. From the first phone call to the night of their stay, everything was handled with efficiency and personal touch. Procedure for payment so that they wouldn't have to show a credit card was explained and handled perfectly. When they checked in they were treated personally and their breakfast the next day was excellent. I recommend this hotel highly and would stay or have my guests stay there without hesitation.", "From the very beginning of my stay here, the service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I had a slight issue with my room, and the front desk person made immediate amends and moved me to another room (someone had smoked in it!) The new room was clean and the beds were very comfortable -- even the pillows! I was at a conference and they had my conference materials delivered to my table, and then when the conference was over, they helped box them up and ship them out. The restaurant food was very good, and the staff in the restaurant was excellent. Oh, and I must mention the concierge folks; really amazing. Thanks for a great stay, and looking forward to next year's conference!", "The hotel was very convenient for LAX, just a quick bus ride, and inside was well laid out and attractive. The lobby bar is a nice place to relax over a beer and a bite to eat. All in all a very pleasant hotel to stay at - good in all categoriesBut the thing that tips my review into 5 stars is the service provided by the staff of the hotel. I left some property behind in the room that frankly I never expected to see again. But when I contacted the hotel a couple of days later they located the lost item and immediately shipped it FedEx to my house, saving my hundreds of dollars. Fantastic service from a great hotel", "The front desk personnel that checked me was totally wonderful as I drilled him with a \"thousand\" question about rooming options since I wanted to have a very special Valentine Day weekend but on a shoestring budget. He made me feel like a high roller or important VIP even though officially I am neither. However, it was a very good feeling to know that as a \"regular\" customer, the hotel cared so much about me and actually took the time to listen to me.I settled on a corner room which gave me windows on 2 walls and more square footage. The decor was very good and the bed of course was very comfortable. I was surprised by the quality of the food in the restaurant. It was really great and the staff was very attentive as well.The location of the hotel is far away enough from the airport to give you the feeling of not being in an airport hotel but close enough to get to the airport quick especially when you are running late.", "This is the 3rd time I have stayed at the Westin and it gets better each time. The staff are wonderful and very attentive. In particular all the staff I encounter in the restaurant are helpful and accommodating especially when I am there for a conference and we have a short time to get in and out with such a big crowd. The food selection is great and every meal was delicious. I now know the names of the staff, and they remember me when I come in. I will be travelling back in May and then again in December, and look forward to staying again. I should say that I am a sales manager of a hotel (not the same chain) in Canada and a former meeting planner so I can be critical of services and staff, but have to say that everything has been flawless, and I am delighted to give this review.", "I was traveling on business but I had my toddler and mother with me. Traveling across the country with a baby isn't easy but the hotel was very responsive and immediately fulfilled our requests for a crib, refrigerator and microwave. And when the baby came down with a cold, they even had a humidifier! The room was clean and comfortable. The housekeeping staff was extremely friendly and readily supplied the extra tissues needed to nurse the cold. I was attending a conference in the hotel and we were given a very reasonable rate with the conference along with free internet access. The staff at the concierge was extremely helpful when I needed to store some items prior to checking in or when I needed to leave a package to be picked up by another conference attendee. Overall it was a very pleasant stay.", "This was my fifth stay at this hotel in the past year. I like to stay here for several reasons: the location to the airport and rental car agencies; the service is always outstanding; the restaurant, while a little pricey, has great choices and great food; and the rooms are first class and surprisely quiet considering the close proximity to the airport. I admit I am a Starwood Platinum member and always expect first class service especially at Westin Hotels. The Westin at Los Angeles Airport never disappoints me. If you arrive late at the airport and need to spend the night, or have an early morning flight, or just have business in or around the airport I highly recommend this hotel for convenience, price and service.", "I stayed at the westin by lax and (not my 1st time) i must say that everytime i go there it's as wonderful and the 1st time. The staff is always on point with questions or whatever it is the you need. The food is superb. I was told that it would be 30-35 minutes but i got my food in like 20 minutes. The ambience is great at the westin. I like going to different hotels to see if theres a better quality place and i just can't seem to shake the westin. When i need a mental relaxation day i run to the westin hotel where i know i can get piece of mind and not be bothered unless i need assistance.", "The LAX Westin was a very pleasant surprise. It's not in the best part of city (actually most of LA is not the \"best part\" of that city) - but this property was an oasis in the middle of the bustle. The staff from the valet to the front desk to the housekeeping teams and everyone in between was exceptional. My only complaints were that this is NOT a part of town to walk around and get some air in, but hopefully the businesses will help renovate the area. My other is that the only restaurant - The Daily Grill - which has exceptional dinners... offered a very over-priced and underwhelming breakfast menu. No one should pay $20 a head for breakfast. Other than that, the Westin itself, is a fantastic option for any business functions and has a great open bar and seating area for socializing and networking.", "I called this hotel after choosing a different site and got the the Assistant Manager, Gerald Dotson! I was fortunate, he listened to my needs for a quiet room, etc.I had a wonderful stay, quiet room, excellent room service, most important the most comfortable bed I have experienced in a hotel. I loved their Heavenly bed so much, I have bought one for my home! Also, I was impressed that they provide Starbucks in the room, unfortunately the pod they use is special for Westin and not available for purchase like their fantastic just fabulous beds!! Needless to say I am now going to always look for Westin hotels or other Starwoods hotels when I travel. The staff especially Mr. Dotson, front desk and others along with the overall facility made my stay at the LAX Westin very enjoyable in spite of my short stay in LA .", "I love Westin hotel because they have the most comfortable bed, the heavenly bed. My friend and I chose to stay at Westin LAX to catch the next day flight to Cancun after staying in Las Vegas for our Christmas holiday. Since our plan was to come back to this hotel after our Cancun trip to catch our flight back to Tokyo, we had asked the bell desk manager to store our winter clothes from Las Vegas while we enjoyed our summer temperature in Cancun. Well, we had so much fun in Cancun and got back to Westin LAX once again to enjoy our cozy bed right before 11 hour flight back to Tokyo. As soon as we arrived at the hotel for the 2nd time, the bell desk quickly arranged our winter clothes to be deliver to our rooms. Because of the smooth transaction, our trip was stress-free in between the summer temperature and winter temperature across the ocean.Thank you so much for your hospitality.(Special thanks to the bell desk manager, Rob.)", "We were assigned the Westin after our flight to London was cancelled twice. We were tired, aggravated, and frustrated but the staff at the Westin could not have been more gracious and understanding. We were assigned a quiet corner room - standard double but very fresh and clean. It's true that like most hotels anymore, they don't give you freebies like shower caps with out asking, but we asked for and received shower caps, toothpaste, robes and slippers within a matter of minutes. We also dined in the Daily Grill, which is a GREAT step up from the hotel's former in-house restaurant. The prices are reasonable esp for hotel dining and there's a wide variety of food available in the bar. I really enjoyed our stay and next time may book a night before our departure to get to stay there again!", "I usually do not write reveiw although I travel often for business. This trip was different, one of my closest and dearest friend died unexpectedly in LA and I traveled to his funeral from Scranton, PA. My stay at the Westin was extremely peaceful. I arrived late Thursday 1/14 evening, once I informed the receptionist of reason for my visit she went out her way to accommodate me. The following day, after the funeral which was held at 10am, I returned to the hotel. My flight was not scheduled until 11pm that night rahter than book a room that I would not occupy that evening, I had lunch at the Daily Grill (awesome) and then worked on my laptop in the Preferred Customer lounge. I would highly recommend the Westin...not to mention the comfy bed!", "I stayed here four times in my life, and I always feel like a princess. My mum uses hotel points for this-- we could never actually afford it otherwise. Once, they bumped us up to an executive suite for free for a week, and they treated us like royalty. The rooms are elegant and beautiful and old fashioned, and the food is amazing. Afternoon tea is wonderful, and the room service, though pricey, is incredible. They will make anything you want. Anything. I asked for broccoli with cheese late one night and I was expecting just that-- but it was an actual sauce, so tasty, and not even on the menu. The concierge is helpful with booking Broadway plays, although I lived in New York for years and prefer getting deals on plays. If you want good seats the night of the show, though, and are prepared to pay, the concierge at this hotel will have them for you without question. If you can afford this place, I highly recommend it. I've never had a more enjoyable hotel experience in my life!", "I have stayed, on different occasions, at the different best hotels in New York. I had never stayed, however, at the Waldorf Astoria. We went just after the hurricane Sandy hit NY. As we all know, this is a hotel built quite some years ago, but it has been kept up and looks perfect. The service was impeccable, and staff very attentive. Our room was very nice and comfortable. A mal-functioning heating was immediately replaced by an electric heater. And because of the \"hardship\" they gave me a hundred bucks on checking out. Now, that is caring for your customer!The Waldorf Astoria has always some kind of promotion or another, so even though the list prices or name would scare some people away, look it up!", "just returned from 4 nights stay in the Waldorf Astoria, Manhattan and have to say I think the hotel is stingy beyond words for charging me (customers) $18.95 per day to have wireless access in rooms. We were paying $300 per night to stay and I think this is a very poor sign of customer service and downright money grabbing. The hotel itself is as would be expected superb from the level of room fittings, to service and food. We dined once in the restaurant where food was excellent, though the filet steaks were a little on the small side and service slow. There appears to be a small number of staff for the size of restaurant. At $288 for a three cours meal for two with no alcohol it is not cheap!! Had probably the best pizza ever via room service - the base was to die for!!All in all a very happy customer but come on Waldorf - this is 2012 - drop your charges for wireless.", "Went to new York for 4 day shopping trip decided to go in style and get junior suite at waldorf when we arrived no junior suite available so they upgraded us to a suite were gobsmacked at how fab it was felt like royalty 2 bathrooms separate living room fantastic. Found prices to drink or eat in hotel pretty outrageous so be warned bring a big fat wallet with u but if u want to make a spurge then this is the place ate in the pull and bear restaurant there one nite even though expensive fab. Loved this hotel old world charm step into 1930s in great location saw on trip advisor some people slating it and they said not 5 star well stayed in loads of 5 star and this definitely up there maybe only thing it falls down in is service if anyone wants to experience the best 5 star service there is go to Killarney park hotel Ireland", "This was my second time staying at the Waldorf and it was yet another great experience. The location is within walking distance for most attractions and if not it is only a short cab drive away. I also like that it is located within mid-town but without all the craziness of Times Square. The room had double beds, which were super comfy, very clean, quiet, and actually quite a nice size. Everyone I met that worked there was very nice and helpful and I liked that you have to use your room card at night in the elevator.Went to see the classic Lion King, which was amazing, along with checking out The Met (art museum not opera house), and the library for their Percy Shelly exhibit. Also checked out Steve Cohen's magic show at the Waldorf Towers. This is a definitel must see NYC show! One of my new favorite steakhouses in NYC is BLT - DELISH! The Boathouse in Central Park was great too, especially since it was perfect weather to sit outside.", "I stayed here in a King Suite, which consisted of a bedroom, bathroom and living room. The rooms were quite large and were very nicely decorated. The hotel is full of history and photographs of famous figures visiting the Waldorf adorn all of the corridors. The lobby is magnificent, as is the Park Avenue entrance.The food and drinks at the Waldorf are not cheap, but the cuisine is excellent. I recommend splashing out for at least one dinner in the Bull and Bear. Our meal there was incredible. Oscar's serves an excellent and extensive breakfast buffet, with very friendly waiters.This was my third stay at the Waldorf this year. Each visit has been superb and I definitely consider this to be my home from home in New York.", "Lots of bad reviews on here but I enjoyed it very much. The suite (in the Towers) was very comfortable and I slept marvelously. There was no sense of it being \"tired\" as some people have stated and we had a brilliant view of the Chrysler building. The only thing that I found slightly disappointing was the welcome on arrival. My flight arrived later than my friend's who had already checked-in but even though both our names were on the booking, the receptionist wouldn't give me the room number and told me to go to a house phone and call the room. It just seemed a little rude and it would have been nicer had he just called her for me.", "Stayed here two years ago and had a few credit card issues. Cant fault the hotel though. We stayed in suite 11R. What an amazing room. Looked out on corner of Park and 50th. Amazing old elegance. Heavy drapes, open fireplace, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Hotel is going through some reservations at present. Was a little disappointed to see the large chandelier has been replaced with more Art Deco lighting which I'm told is part of the restoration of the hotel bringing it back to its former glory. All said it was an amazing stay and can't fault anything. I hope I'm lucky enought to return again someday. Wouldn't stay in any other hotel in NYC. it's just perfectly situated!", "Our stay at the Astoria was part of a special birthday visit with our two children - 10 and under. Room was lovely, bathroom clean and the shower great. Service was fantastic and everyone was really helpful. We were there during Hurricane Sandy and although they ended up a bit short staffed the only thing they reduced was room service on one day when you had to request maid service if you wanted it. They laid on additional tours of the hotel for those of us who were stuck in as the storm came in. We wouldn't have done something like that normally but it was great and we got to see bits of the hotel we wouldn't have done otherwise and really learn about the amazing history of the place. Would recommend the hotel, the tour (I think they do them to a lesser degree normally) and simply the experience of staying in this famous location.", "Had an amazing experience at the WA. Guest service was excellent from all staff, genuine friendliness from George who we met in the lobby area and saw a few times during our stay. Barbara led our hotel tour and what a great lady she was, made us feel at home while sharing the incredible history of the hotel. Our room was clean, spacious and luxurious. The beds were the best we have slept in at a hotel, bathroom was marble with nice amenities and lovely scented soaps. We dined at Oscars which had an excellent quality buffet and delicious desserts, loved the red velvet cake! We were so fortunate to stay a the Waldorf for a special 60th birthday trip and we would return in a heartbeat if the opportunity arises. The location is idea for seeing all the major sights of NYC.", "I love the Waldorf as it is by far the most grand hotel in all of NYC. From the moment you walk in you are greated by the breath taking lobby. My first stay I had a suite which had two double beds in the bedroom and a huge flat screen tv; a living room with a huge flat screen tv and a huge bathroom. It was my birthday so I was greeted with a bottle of champaign. My most recent stay this past June I stayed in a large room with a large bathroom and good closet space. My room also had a great view of Park Ave. The rooms are a good size are very clean and the beds are very comfy. I truly love the old world feel this hotel has. I would recomend this hotel to everyone. The staff is great. George the bellhop is very kind and will answer all your questions the best he can. Also Peacock Alley in the lobby serves great burger slidders and fries (however it is on the pricey side but it is the Waldorf after all).", "We recently spent a night at the Waldorf Astoria, all I can say is WOW! we got one of our rooms early in the morning, so we had the continental breakfast on the 26th floor. This was no ordinary breakfast, there was bottled water Voss, omg, I could not believe it. There was fresh deli meats Ham and Turkey. Lox, all types of teas and more. Our room was great, we stayed in the Towers, when you stepped off the elevator it was as if you had stepped into Buckingham Palace. The bed, oh the bed, when I fnally got to bed I swear the comforters welcomed me and enclosed me in their warmth. It was like I was floating, I slept like a baby. The staff was very nice and I enjoyed the Piano player Saturday night in the Lobby. I would love to go back again..There was a group of 20 we had a great time.", "The Waldorf Astoria is old school at it's best - the glamorous interiors thrill you on entering, the staff the most friendly I have ever encountered in a Manhattan hotel, the room spacious and luxurious. Everybody, and everything we encountered during our 4 night stay was beyond my expectations - even to the point of being offered an umbrella one morning on our way out, as \"it may rain later\". Champagne in the Peacock Ally is a must - to people watch, take in the beautiful decor, and simply enjoy a moment listening to the pianist play Cole Porter whilst New Yorks finest head out for the evening ...... The renovations do take a little away from the exterior, but once inside you are in a magical place where nothing seems to be too much trouble ....... the Waldorf Astoria cocoons you in a world where everything is just fine!", "Travelled on the 9th December 2012. 3rd trip to New York and 2nd time to the Waldorf.Had a little hick up upon check in but finally got our junior suite we had booked (very busy).2 full bathrooms, bedroom separated by a proper door and sofa bed in a massive living area.Some may say the decor is shabby but you have to remember this hotel is never empty and considering the age of the hotel I was presently surprised how elegent, clean and comfortable the room was. A few marks here and there on the walls I would accept.We have previously stayed here in a superior guest room and found this also a stunning elegant room.The only slight down side is the lighting, 3 lamps only I feel is insufficient for the size of the room.Perfect position, fantastic views - just stunning.I will definitely be back.", "My son and I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria from the 30 August until 4 September 2012 and we could not have asked for a better hotel to stay. And the weather was brilliant too.....Everything was perfect. We had a problem with a leak and damaged cameras...but the staff promptly moved our room and paid for all the damages.My sister had stayed here for her 30th and I thought I'd do the same for my 50th. From the time we arrived we were treated like important guests. The breakfast is pricey in the actually hotel, so we found one just across the road, an all day breakfast place....the people in there were so nice and so was the food,In fact the whole experience of being in New York will never be forgotten, it has left us with nothing but brilliant memories.Thank you to all the staff for making that happen :)", "We had a group of 6 people who were supposed to spend a week in NYC, but at the last minute, we had to cancel one reservation for 3 people. The Waldorf staff was extremely accommodating with the cancellation. Three of us continued on with our trip and checked into the Waldorf. The location was great and the concierge suggested a fantastic restaurant around the corner from the hotel. We did have one challenge, which was resolved well above our expectations. The hotel had a flood which affected our room. The hotel staff moved us from the Waldorf to the Waldorf Towers. We felt that the staff and management truly understood the impact the flood had on us and took very good care of us during the remainder of our trip. I'm sure we would have still be very happy in the Waldorf, but I'm pretty sure when I return to NYC, I'd want to stay in the Towers again.", "We booked into the Waldorf Astoria as part of our silver wedding trip in 2005. Everything about our stay was fantastic, even more so when we were given the Presidential Suite as we were Hilton Honors Diamond members. The front desk was very helpful but unfortunately we did not get our usual access to the Executive Lounge.We also stayed in the Waldorf Astoria Towers which is above the hotel, that experience was sadly lacking, we paid for the romance package of $550 approx per night, but it didnt arrive until we went to bed.The suite we were given was also in great need of refurbishment ,the bathroom had mould and broken tiles, with the wallpaper peeling. The decor looked as though someone had went to a second hand shop and just picked up bits of odd furniture. Not what you expect especially from a hotel of this standard.The only down side for us was the breakfast , more like scramble to get it and the quality was not very good, maybe just a bad few days we were there.", "Great location in Midtown.The Hotel was everything what we expected, Hotel lounge was even more than expectation, what a feeling entertained with live music played with Cole Porters piano, extra vibes for Pianist and us, with same time fantastic cocktails.We stayed at seven nights and legendary service as well as the staff were all very lovely, the queue at reception to check in and out were very quick. Concierges gave us good tips for very best and different jazz clubs, etc. The room was comfortable and spacious enough for us, the bed were comfortable too with very best pillows, the wardrobe has room for luggage and the bathroom was lovely, powerful shower and plenty of room, in the mornings was newspaper at our door. The air conditioning was adjustable.We stayed in the Hotel in July, the front of the hotel was undergoing renovations, so we used mostly the Lexington entrance which was also closer to several subway lines.Value for money, we would definitely recommend this hotel for couples", "I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria on the evening of September 4th, 2012. Delays into LaGuardia Airport caused me to arrive well after the check-in time of 3pm. I arrived at the front desk at 11:30pm and was told that the king bed room that I had reserved was no longer available. To compensate, I was upgraded to a luxury room with two queen beds, a sitting room and a beautiful art deco bath. Double the square footage to boot! What a treat after a long day of travel. This is my 4th time staying at the Waldorf and each time I am reminded of what a great value it is for the service and the location in Mid-Town. Great lobby bar/restaurant as well. Thanks to Andrew from Deleware who gave my husband and me great tips on where to eat. All in all, a terrific stay!", "We stayed at the Waldorf for a long Weekend & what a great choice we made! As you enter the building you can't help but be blown away by the size & opulence of the Reception & lobby area. When we went to our rooms the corridors were so wide you could drive a car down them. Our room was stylish & spacious & just what you need after \"shop til you drop\" days. The breakfast was beautiful with lots of choice & you should really go for the Sunday Brunch which is served at the restaurant in the Lobby from 10 until 2-30 & is $98 per adult. Everywhere you go in the Hotel you feel the History but without it looking dated. every US President has stayed here since Herbert Hoover. Everything about the hotel is amazing including the location. We think you will love it!", "Stayed here July 6th for 3 nights and was kind of expecting to be a little disappointed as was expecting so much from this icon of New York. I was NOT disappointed at all, walked in and my mouth dropped but the sheer beauty of this place, yes there are more opulent rooms with more modern decor in other hotels but if that is what you want then I suggest you book one of those hotels. If you want to immerse yourself in old world glamour and style then you will not be disappointed by it. Just around the corner is a lovely bar at St Bart's which is relaxing and food is lovely. Waldorf is a great central location to get to the sights and I would recommend this hotel as an ideal base.", "This was the second time staying at the Waldorf and I wasn't disappointed on my return visit. First class room, superb building and friendly helpful staff.We didn't eat in the restaurants but ordered room service which was really good, although a little slow in arriving (1.5hrs wait but we were told about this before we ordered). The sheer opulence of this hotel is enough to take your breath away. We had interconnecting rooms on the 6th floor and it was more like a two bed room suite with dressing rooms and amazing bathrooms, I could go on and on about the great rooms. Our rooms over-looked Park Ave and although you could hear the traffic, the doorman's whistle and never-ending horns it just added to the vibe of NYC for us.Great stay in a great city, thanks for the memories.", "Just spent a week at the Waldorf Astoria on our first visit to New York City. The hotel is absolutely fabulous and as we were celebrating our Silver Wedding Anniversary we were happy to push the boat out. Restaurants and bars in the hotel are expensive but there are plenty of others in the locality and we were happy to go out to eat. The reception area is just as I imagined it would be. Our room was a bit tired but had everything we needed for our stay and we had a great view over Lexington Avenue. Scaffolding on the exterior meant the main entrance was closed but this was never a problem as there were entrances on all the other streets. A great location for visiting all the sites and easy walking distance to Times Square. All in all a fabulous trip and would have no hesitation in recommending this fabulous hotel.", "I stayed at the Waldorf with my family for 6 nights recently and thoroughly enjoyed the comfortable lodgings, great service and historic atmosphere. While the hotel is undergoing a face-lift at the moment, the staff went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and convenient. Speaking of convenient, the location can't be beat...it's close to just about everything, or within a short walk to the subway and Grand Central Station. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms are large and clean. However, the thing that stood out for me was the service...from Eric at the door, who welcomed us and helped us find our way, to Shioban (sorry if I misspelled it!) at the reception desk, who was cheerful and efficient. Room service, albeit pricey (what's not in NYC?), was rapid and the choice and quality of the meals good.I would definitely stay here again.", "When I booked this trip for my 14-year-old daughter and myself, I looked into competitively priced hotels. When I saw that the Waldorf Astoria was consistent with and even better than moderately-priced hotels, I didn't hesitate in booking it -- I wanted to brag that I stayed at The Waldorf! We were not disappointed -- upon check-in (we were a little early), they didn't have any of the queen bed rooms we we reserved, so they upgraded us to a king. My husband and I stayed in NY when we were younger and on a more limited budget and had a room we couldn't both walk in at the same time -- this room was fabulous -- the bathroom excellent. We didn't splurge on any of the restaurants on site -- they looked very fancy for a teenager and I, but the location was very close to everything we wanted to see: Rockefeller Center was a short walk, not to mention great shopping, Times Square, etc. Very pleased with our stay and the staff was excellent!", "Just left a stay at Waldorf and must say I was impressed with the quality of service by the entire staff. I was greeted quickly at reception, received friendly assistance from housekeeping and bellman. Concierge did an excellent job of making recommendation for dinner. The service felt personal and professional. Also, I left my glasses in my room and remembered as I was leaving for a meeting. Within 5 minutes, the security officer, Sam, called on my mobile having retrieved them. They were waiting for me when I returned. Just a really impressive job by the entire staff, and I'm a frequent traveler. I'll definitely be back. Oh- rooms were spacious; towels were not over laundered and bed was very comfortable.", "The Waldorf Astoria holds a very special place in my heart. Perhaps its grandeur needs a to be polish somewhat recently; nevertheless, the history it holds can go beyond limits. It is New York. In my book, The Waldorf, is simply a \"New York Landmark\". I remember staying in a very nice suite and loved the \"Art Deco\" look of black and white floor tiles and style of the bathroom and elegant suite; as if I had travelled back in time. It has that \"Classic and Elegant style\"; Cole Porter music playing in the lobby and what a grand entrance!, Manhattan luxury hotel indeed. We enjoyed a charming dinner at the Peacock Alley; a break at Bull and Bear Bar and at Sir Harry's. I will always recommend to experience the atmosphere of this wonderful and timeless hotel in Manhattan for its history and charm.", "My fiance and I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria for 4 nights at the end of july and it was without a doubt the most beautiful hotel we've ever stayed in. The location is great, walking distance to everything. The staff is very friendly and the room service is impeccable. If I could give it more than a five star I would. The lobby is beautiful as well as very secure, you need your hotel key to have access to the elevators after 6 p.m. which I found comforting. Everybody in this hotel is friendly. It is a pure joy and makes New York an even better city ! Will definitely be staying here again on our next trip. Worth every penny.", "The hotel is magnificent, very elegant and old style, it reminded me of those old movies with Audrey Hepburn. For me, this is the esscence of New York.The room was big and the decor is old style, bathroom was very good.What i liked the best is the location, walking distance to everything, and on a saturday, the street next to the hotel was closed off to traffic and made into a bazaar, which by itself was a lot of fun.It is a stop for the tours, so i bought bus tour tickets and it would drop me right in front of the hotel, so i never had to take a cab.Room service was great, i LOVED their pizza, their steak restaurant is excellent, and so is the brunch on sundays, everything is worth trying.", "Stayed here in July , had booked a small suite but on arrival we were upgraded to an executive suite .WOW. It was fantastic , massive and immaculate . The staff were lovely , tip your maid on arrival and she will leave tons of extra towels , toiletries etc . Reception is busy but they have lots of desks and we never waited more than a few minutes . Eating in the hotel is expensive but the food is superb , you have to do it even just for the memory . Gift shop in hotel was really nice and classy and cheaper than the rubbish in the tourist areas . Buy your snacks and drinks in there to as it is cheaper than surrounding shops and mini bar . I have been to NYC six times but nothing compares to our trip to the Waldorf . AMAZING !", "I had a wonderful stay at the Waldorf=Astoria this past weekend! I was concerned about many of the reviews recently written, but was very pleased with my stay. Yes, the Park Ave lobby area is under contruction so that was a minor issue, but it was very easy to find the main lobby for check in. Beautiful lobby and excellent service at check-in. The room was clean and very comfortable. Had a little difficulty managing the temperature control in the room. No matter what temp I put the air conditioner on, the air stayed the same temp. So, at night, I just turned off the air and was fine. All in all, it was a wonderful stay, and I certainly would not hesitate to go back for another weekend at the Waldolf.", "When our car arrived in the drive port, we were greeted by friendly porters who tagged our luggage and told us it would be in our room (it was). The front desk was fast, friendly, and arranged for a suite upgrade for very little. Our corner room was spacious, clean, with eight fluffly pillows on the king bed. The towels were soft and the robes a nice touch. The layout is full of small details that most hotels never include and are too numerous to mention. The concierge was very helpful, providing guides to all the attractions. The hotel's location to events made it within walking distance to most venues. However, a cab ride was only $5-7 on average to Times Square or Central Park. We had cocktails in the Bull and Bear, reasonably priced and very comfortable with no waiting. The security here is extremely good and we felt very safe the entire time. The room includes a large safe (we never used ours). Shopping is close with Fifth Avenue less than five minutes by cab. I will forever remember our stay, one of the most pleasant of any hotel in my sixty years of life.", "If you want to be in central New York, you couldn't wish for a better location. The rooms are luxurious in an era gone by fashion, with lovely toiletries, and as one reviewer mentioned, even umbrellas in the rooms. Unlike one unfortunate reviewer, we were met at the entrance of the hotel, our luggage carried into our room and experienced the zip in/zip out check in process. The staff were very polite and helpful with tour/show bookings, restaurant recommendations, etc. and it was nice to be greeted like an old friend every time one came back to the hotel. Free internet access was only available in the main lobby and predictably the lobby was always full of hotel guests using their electronic devices and hence nowhere to sit, unless you ate or had a drink in the lobby restaurant. Despite this, I would stay at the Waldorf again.", "I was a little concerned about staying here because of some of the reviews I have seen. Fortunately not one thing about this classic old hotel was negative. Every person we came in contact with was warm and welcoming, from the reception desk to the cleaning staff. The entire place just sparkles, and makes you feel as though you are royalty. Our room was 610, no view to speak of, but the room itself was spotless, and had so much charm. Bed was super comfy, and the bathroom was larger than I have seen before in city hotels. There was some renovation going on, so some of the hotel exits (main Park Ave for example) were closed off. No matter, since the hotel takes up a whole city block you could find your way out with no problem. One other thing to note is that I found this a very quiet hotel, you could hear some street noise ( the lullaby of manhattan :) ) but not bothersome at all. Heard no noise from rooms on either side of us, and no loud cleaning staff in the mornings. I will stay here again!", "Ever since seeing Scent of a Woman I have wanted to go to e Waldorf and order a John Daniels at the bar. I finally got around to it and, despite the $17.42 price for a single JD, it was superb. The hotel is quite nice and my room spacious. I was a bit put off by the cashed up bogans in the foyer but I think that they were probably more sticky-beakers, rather than actual guests of the hotel. Service was swift, room was spotless, concierge aloof but ok. All in all, I have always wanted to stay here and I finally got around to it. Would definitely go back and would recommend. Even though my room was a cheaper room, it had a great view of Park Ave. loved it. Also if you do stay there, there is free postage for hotel guests in their business centre up to a pound a parcel. I sent 8 parcels home. Giddy up.", "Celebrated my 40th birthday with 5 nights in the Waldorf Astoria and it did not disappoint. With ourselves and another couple travelling, we had two excellent rooms. Staff very friendly, everyone speaks, good morning etc. Ensure you treat yourself to breakfast at the Peacock Alley restaurant or a beer at the Bull and Bear, both excellent, although pricey. My only regret is that we did not do the Waldorf Astoria Hotel Tour to take in all the sights, although on our last day I did get a sneak look at the Grand Ball Room on Floor 3. Even though we are from the UK, are have an interest in American history and the walls are adorned of black and white photos of Presidents, Kings and uens who have stayed at thh Waldorf. Also, you see hotos of famous actors attending gala dinners there etc. The place is stepped in history......Brilliant, will go back some day.", "Could not fault many aspects of the Waldorf Astoria after our recent stay in New York, from the moment we arrived at the hotel until our departure the staff we friendly and very knowledgable and only to happy to assist. The hotel is currently under refurbishment so access to the hotel has changed but this does not hinder any entry or exit to the building. Within walking distance to many restuarants and Times Square and short taxi ride to many other attractions. Visited the resturants within the Waldorf and the Bull & Bear is a little expensive as most mains are in excess of $50 but their nips of alcohol/ glasses of wine are very generous and the service is above average with attentive staff so not a place to visit if dining on a budget. If you enjoy buildings with heritage and charm as well as modern luxuries will not be disappointed with the Waldorf Astoria. Highly recommend.", "My husband and I were in Manhattan in June 2012 for 4 days on a combination business/vacation trip, and had a GREAT experience at the Waldorf Astoria! During our entire stay, everyone on the hotel staff, from the doormen, to the bell staff, to the front desk staff, the restaurant servers and especially housekeeping, were incredibly friendly, professional, knowledgeable and accommodating! We loved it! There was a slight mishap with our room assignment when we checked in (they gave us a room that was already occupied by other travelers - oops!), so they immediately more than made up for it by upgrading us to a corner suite with an incredible view of the NYC skyline, including the Chrysler building and East River. It was amazing! In addition, the 24 hour room service menu was extensive and all of the food was delicious and delivered to our room exactly as ordered and within the time frame promised. Their restaurants and bars were also wonderful, and the hotel tour was incredibly interesting! Last year, we stayed in the Waldorf Towers, which were also luxurious, and where we likewise had incredible views and even a private balcony! We can't wait to go back!", "We were staying in the Astoria for the June back holiday and the hotel was everything I expected and more. We arrived to a glamourous welcome but too early for our room (11:30am to be exact).The reception staff told us to start enjoying New York and took our number, kindly advising us they would text us when the room was ready. In less than an hour we received a text that the room was ready! The room was splendid, truly casts you back to Sinatra days with opulent, traditional glamour, traditional decorations and all decorated immaculately! Unfortunately our room was right by the lift so we rang reception to complain about the slight noise from the lift and within 15 minutes the staff moved us to another room. This was an even better room with a bathroom almost as big as the bedroom! Really helpful staff and a stunning hotel! Great central location too, just 2 minutes from Central Station! Fab breakfast too, homemade Granola is a true delight!", "It is all about the people. I have had the pleasure to spend lots of time at my NYC home. After all, it is the Waldorf. Charm at every turn,property and people wise. I love, love, love walking through the door and I feel as if it is my home. Big smiles, the team wanting to know where I am and truly are. AC isn't t perfect, beds are great, cocktails are great at peacock alley(ask for Crystal(mgr), Austin or babu. The best! It all centers around Jackie, Mary, gena, rebbekah, Agnes, servando, michael, George and many others many others. Consider yourself the luckiest person ever, if you end up here...kudos to Eric long for having the best ever team!", "Our trip to Houston was for business as well as for pleasure. We booked 2 rooms and stayed for 4 nights. The location is good only if one has a car as there is nothing nearby within wakable distance. The parking is adjacent to the hotel and is around 8$ per day The front office staff are excellent and were willing to go extra mile to make our stay confortable. The room is spacious and has all amenities including microwave and refrigerator. The view from the room is great but only from upper floors. The breakfast is available in the restaurant for $ 10.99 but does not include beverages. The galleria mall is about 5 miles from the hotel and there is complemetary shuttle provided by the hotel. On one of the days i took a city tour and NASA and the operator picked me up from the hotel for extra cost. Above all it was an excellent stay which we throughly enjoyed.", "We were planning our 53rd wedding anniversary celebration and the best gift was finding Mandy Bates, the Concierge at this hotel. She went way beyond what we expected, not only with our room reservations, but also with recommendations/suggestions which made our whole trip memorable. The accommodations and staff mirrored Mandy's excellence. The room was spacious, clean, quiet and the beds were most comfortable. From the front desk to the bar and restaurant, the service was courteous and attentive. The food and drinks were well prepared and quite tasty. We are new to the area and plan on spending some time in Houston and we will certainly make the Crowne Plaza Houston River Oaks our headquarters.papa and bear, Mont Belvieu, TX", "My husband and I decided to stay the weekend here for our anniversary, the rates were very affordable so we were not expecting much, but boy were we surprised!!! As we were checking in we were greeted by Sherry who was very friendly and outgoing, as we made small talk while she checked us in Kirk (manager) overheard that it was our anniversary and upgraded our rooms to a king suite. Once we got to the room we were very pleased with how spacious it was. Sherry and Mandi knocked on our door with a fruit and cheese tray decorated with fresh flowers. I would definetly stay here again!! These hotel employees Sherry, Kirk and Mandy deserve awards for going over and beyond their duties to ensure that we had great stay!!!", "I travel extensively for business and this hotel is the Whole Package.  The staff is fantastic. Shaila at the front desk, Mandy the Concierge, and Debbie & Claudia who manage Sales are all very professional, kind and interested in making your visits most enjoyable. The hotel management will look you up at the Wednesday Mgr Reception. Nice! They care.  Within walking distance are plenty of restaurants of all star ratings and cuisines so no need to drive. The River Oaks area has a great neighborhood feel and a small park is across the street from the hotel.  This is the best central location to access all highways heading any direction around Houston. All the amenities and decor are very nice quality and nightly rates are reasonable.  This is the best place to stay in Houston and I look forward to my next visit. Darin E.", "I travel to Houston once a month for work and every time I stay it seems they have a new surprise for me. the first stay they had cookies and milk waiting in my room when I arrived because I am a member of the priority club... I called the front desk to tell them they put me in someone else's room cause there was food on the desk. It was pretty funny for us all when I found out it was supposed to be there and it was for me! They have very friendly and caring staff from the front desk to the house keepers. They seek to fix ANY problems you have for whatever makes you feel less than extremely satisfied. Tonight I attended my first Priority Club social where they offered free hors d'oeuvres and cocktails, they have drawings for free stuff like breakfast, more points, desert... Etc. This is a well kept hotel, comfy beds, heavenly fluffy pillows, good location, and overall my first choice stay when in Houston.", "I stayed at this hotel this past Saturday night with some of my close girlfriends for a mini reunion and a much-needed night out in our hometown. As soon as I pulled into the driveway, the staff were already extremely attentive and very service-oriented. They immediately made me feel welcome! Mandy was especially helpful in giving us suggestions of where to go and how to get there. We initially went to Rice Village (just about 1.5 miles) for dinner and a few drinks, and we ended up in Midtown (about 2.5 miles). Cabs were easy to catch, and very inexpensive to and from the hotel. The hotel has a great location, wonderful staff, clean/comfortable rooms and if you're a Priority Club member, you get complimentary cookies and milk in your room! Boy, was that a nice treat! I will most definitely be staying here again.", "We come to Houston quite often for Medical reasons for my husband...he has ALS. On our last visit we had a mix-up and my husbands bag with his pain medicine, his medical records, and I-pad were left in someone's vehicle and we had to figure out how to get in touch with these people. So I was crying and came downstairs to use the computer, but they were all being used by other guests So I waited and they weren't getting off anytime soon. And that's when your Concierge...Mandy Bates came over and got me and let me use her computer and even helped me search for what I was looking for. To make a long story short, we got everything back the next morning. She didn't have to do that but I was so glad she did. AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!", "The Crowne Plaza River Oaks Houston, Tx. is where I am currently staying for my business travel on the West Loop. The staf here at the hotel are some of the best I have dealt with in a long time.From checking in with Tiara to the hospitality where Mandy welcomes you it always with a smile on their faces and calling you out by name. If your thirsty for an adult beverage, go see Carlos down at the hotel bar and he will make you at home there, just like walking to the set of cheers and making you feel like Norm. I highly recommend this hotel for your next stay even near the Galleria area. Just got to watch out for the parking garage the spots are little tight.", "This was my first time at this hotel and I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly service. I had a problem with the TV remote and called for a replacement, not only was it replaced but the front desk called me twice to make sure that it was taken care of, they were considerate and genuinely friendly. They were helpful with directions,etc. The breakfast buffet was excellent for 8 dollars. The restaurant was clean, the service was prompt and the food was fresh and well prepared. It was not fancy by any means but it was well stocked and great for kids. The swimming pool was clean and never crowded, it is next to the street so you here a lot of car traffic. There was ample parking in the lot. My room was clean and it had a good sized refrigerator, microwave and a small sink. Overall, I highly rate this hotel it is definitely fairly priced and has great service.", "I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza River Oaks a couple of times now and, by and large, the staff is exceptional. This last time I checked in, Mandy remembered me, knew me by name & greeted me with the warmest of welcomes. Having to come back in to Houston repeatedly for medical appointments is tough, but it is a lot easier knowing that my accommodations will always exceed my needs & expectations.I also want to give a shout out to Anna Marie and Alex at the front desk. They make checking in easy & painless. They are both extremely professional, competent, and friendly.The rooms are very nice. The beds are very comfortable. The marble topped furniture and bathrooms are classy. The shuttle is convenient. Parking is in a garage, so there is a fee, but it is covered (which is a pretty big bonus in Texas- think scorching sun). But it is the staff that make this hotel a standout and a winner my book.", "I have to travel to Houston off and on, often, throughout the year, and I stay in hotels in different cities throughout the country, as many nights of the year as I do in my home. Every time I come to Houston, Crowne Plaza River Oaks is my choice! Mandy, the concierge, makes my stay each time, just like being at home! I cannot say enough great things about her, and the rest of the staff here, everyone has a great attitude, and they make being on the road...as pleasant as it gets! The hotel property is always super clean, the rooms are consistently spotless and the staff is great! Thanks Mandy for always being cheerful and helpful and efficient...keep up the great work!", "I stayed at the Crowne Plaza the 3rd week of June for 4 nights. I travel alot and I know how hard it is to love any hotel for 4 nights. This hotel exceeded my expectations in every way. Their front desk agents on the first day I arrived were awesome. The bell captain was patient and courteous. The bar and banquet staff were astounding. The DOS and the concierge were very helpful to me as I had not been in that area in a long time. The Wednesday reception was one of the best I have ever been to in a hotel. Room service meal and waiter were perfect. The guestroom was clean and comfortable and had everything I needed. I would stay at this hotel again and again and have recommended it to several people already. I hope the GM and the owners appreciate the staff they have at this hotel - it is hard to come by. I hope the owners appreciate the GM and how he leads his staff. I hope the staff appreciates their bosses. You can tell that this is a full circle of excellence! Job well done!", "Wow! I made a reservation on-line through priceline, and dont regret it one bit. We stayed a total of 4 nights while house hunting. Nicholas the Manager at night was remarkable!! We came in at 4am, and he was the most pleasant person we have ever encountered at a hotel. You can tell he genuinely cares about guests. \"Southern Hospitality\" runs through his blood. He knew all the great local places to dine, and I was quite impressed with his knowledge. My two kids absolutely adored \"Nick at Nite\". They would ask to go see him every night upon returning to the hotel. I cant say enough about this young man, but to sum it up... Congrats to whomever hired him, and keep him around for years to come. The lobby was beautiful, with a decent pool. The room we stayed in was fabulous, with some extremely comfortable beds. The breakfast in the restaurant was GRAND. The only complaint I had was the INTERNET was slow at times! Way to go Nick, hope to see you again soon.", "I have been a regular business traveler to Houston and stay at Crown Plaza River oaks frequently. I also stayed at near by Galleria hotels as well as the ones at West belt area. This is a great value considering the price paid and service. I work at Green way plaza and Crown plaza river oaks is walkable. Location is fantastic. Costco, LA fitness are with in a mile. Lots of parking in a near by deck. The rooms size is good, but the color scheme and carpet is little pale. Time to update the paint. The pool is very small and not much use. Breakfast is very good with hot and cold options, but little expensive. Reception staff are excellent. Especially Shaila and Anna Marie are super nice, very friendly and always been very helpful. In summary an excellent value with an outstanding frond desk staff", "We got a 10 day reservation for my brother through Priceline at this hotel. For health reasons, my brother was not able to travel to Houston. Due to the nature of the illness and the nature of my brother's health care provider plan, we were not able to comply with Priceline's requirements for refunding the large prepaid bid. When the situation was explained to a certain manager at Crowne Plaza, they showed considerable kindness and refunded the reservation to Priceline, who then refunded us. I hesitate to write this review: on one hand the benevolence of the manager must be recognized; they did not have to refund our considerable bid, on the other hand, Tripadvisor readers should not get the impression that they can change their minds and expect that this hotel will help them evade Priceline's blind bidding process: our situation was unique and unusual.By the way, we have stayed here in the recent past and thought that Crowne Plaza was comfortable and a good value.", "I've been staying here for 12 years when I come to Houston for business (it was previously a Holiday Inn). This is truly a great hotel! First, I'll begin with the rooms. The beds are very comfortable, the rooms are clean, the air conditioning is great & the water pressure is perfect. Next, the conference rooms are excellent. The lighting, sound, food, etc. is great. Last, the staff makes you feel welcome. They truly do a great job & they appreciate your business. Some of the folks that standout are Mandy Bates who is the concierge manager (she goes out of her way to make sure you know where the nearby restaurants are located, the folks in the banquest staff starting with Juan Rovira, Jorge Ramirez, Joel Rodriguez, Sylvia Alvarez, Immer Salgado (I apologize for not knowing the rest of the banquet team), Harold Lucas in sales, Sammy ( I don't know her last name, she is the phone operator & is very pleasant), & Ron Arthur who is in charge of AV. Keep up the great work!", "Came to Houston first week in May and stayed here after finding much of downtown hotels were booked and really high- priced....loved it. We had a huge view of the whole skyline , it's 7 minutes to downtown, you can walk around the block to tons of restaurants and bars in this \" upper Kirby \" area. It's clean, and the amenities are great ! They give you the morning paper everyday, microwave n fridge in your room, huge bathroom and they leave a sign informing you that you can get complimentary razors, toothbrushes, toothpastes etc. stuff no other hotels will give you for free if you forget. Pool is nice and they have 2 restaurants and a business center where you can use the computers and print for free. I'll definitely stay at crown plazas after having such a great experience after this one.", "Last month I visited Houston while making a business trip. I stayed at the Houston River Oaks Crowne Plaza, and I had an excellent experience. The location is really good, the room was in good conditions, and the cleanliness also good. Beyond everyghing I have to mention the best service I have ever get from a hotel's staff member (and I travel a lot, since I coordinate presidential business trips), I refer to Nicholas Ervin. He really helped me solve a lot of issues, for the week I stayed there. His excellent attitude made my work much easier, and he definitely made the diference.I really appreciate his kidness and efficiency, at all times.Thanks for giving such a great service. I am one happy and satisfied customer.Best regards, Maria Campos", "My wife and I spent 2 nights here for a quick visit to see a baseball game and enjoy some of Houston's restaurants. We were pleasantly surprised by all aspects of this hotel. When we checked in on Wednesday afternoon we were met with smiling faces and accommodating staff. We were then informed of a reception they have on Wednesday night for Priority Club Members which was outstanding with hors d 'oeuvres and open bar. Mandy who hosted the event and the rest of the employees present at the event were all great.The rooms were very comfortable and good size and the beds were comfortable. We didn't eat at the restaurant but did have a drink at the bar with a friend from the Houston area and it was nice for a hotel bar. I would definitely stay here again if and when I return to Houston and I know others already do so as we met several people at the reception that stay here regularly for business.", "The Hotel is nice and the Management is very professional. I first met with Debbie Hollier - Director of Sales & Marketing regarding my long stay package about 3 months. She provided very helpful info and offered a good package that made me confirmed the reservation without hesitation. Anyone who need to stay in a nice hotel in Houston with a good deal should contact Debbie for details.Upon check-in, I met the Front Desk Manager - Jackie Frank who was helpful and patiently gone through all the details. In fact, Jackie helped my check-out too and she is very helpful and efficient. During my stay in the hotel, I met some other employees that are also doing great jobs such as the Concierge, Mandy Bates; other members of the front desk team including Roxanne, Tara, Shaila, Christopher, Anna Maria, David and Marcela. The last but not the least, I will surely come back to live in this Hotel again in future when visiting Houston and do not hesitate to recommend this Hotel to anyone who is visiting Houston.", "We had the wedding party and out of town family and friends stay at this location for a wedding in the museum district. They were very accommodating with distribution of gift bags, extending hours in the bar and provided a great suite for the girls hair and makeup sessions. I must say that a bridemaid misplaced a jacket that the bride was to take on the honeymoon with her new monogram and their Lost and Found located it for us on Monday. It was in a paper bag! When they cleaned the room, all items went to lost and found. What a save! Being the MOB, they assurred the weekend to be stress free concerning the accommodations. Many thanks to Dimples B. for helping us set up the 20 rooms.", "We have relied on Crowne Plaza River Oaks for many guest visiting from from out of town. Not only are the rates fair, but the service is outstanding. Dimples Boettcher works with our group regularly and goes above and beyond with her team to ensure that our lodging requests are accommodated. I can attest that the rooms are fabulous, dining is wonderful and the decor is warm and welcoming. Several individuals from my company have had formal meetings, lunch, dinner or breakfast meetings here with no complaint. The location is most convenient, as it is in proximity of the Medical Center, the freeway, Rice University and more. Also, Crowne Plaza River Oaks has a very dependable shuttle service that many of us have used used time and time again. This is a great place for lodging. I recommend this location regularly.", "This was my first experience arranging this large an event. From beginning to end the staff was absolutely amazing. Starting with Angie Techmanski who arranged the event and gave me the who's who to work with. I met with Harold Lucas who was simply wonderful and fully understanding of my needs. Harold was very gracious in helping me with any questions I had at any time. The accomodations, food was fabulous. Juan Rovira the Banquets Director took care of every detail in our meals and refreshments. They took away any stress or worry about being able to have a productive meeting instead of worrying about the accomodations or meals. I felt as though we got the royal treatment from everyone on your staff. I can't thank them enough.", "Jackie Franks checked us in. She was the friendlest check in staff I have ever had. She went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with our accomadations and even got a maid to get a room ready before time because we were so tired and needed rest. She checked on us through out our two night stay to see if we needed anything. Wow! Never been treated so royally! Had a few issues with bellman but the concierge, MANDY BATES, was right on it. She did everything she could to make sure we were happy and she addressed the minor issue and resolved it to our satisfaction. She could not do enough to assist us with directions, suggestions and just good conversation, when she was available. Both staff members made our stay special. We ate breakfast in dining room and omlets were out of this world. I would recommend hotel to any one wanting a friendly, quiet and comfortable stay. We love staying at HI properties where there are \"no surprises\" and wouldn't stay anywhere else! Powell's from Louisiana", "I would like to offer a tremendous amount of gratitude for Roxanne, who was assisting customers at the front desk on the second morning of our stay at this hotel. We had a difficult previous evening with noise from an adjacent guest and the next morning we asked Roxanne if she could help us move as we had several days left to stay. This was a very difficult stay for us as we were attempting to help my sister who recently had a stroke and was at a Texas Medical Center facility. Our days were very long and difficult. Roxanne was able to secure a very comfortable and quiet room for us. We just want to offer a very large thank you to Roxanne, and if anyone needs some help at this fine hotel just ask for Roxanne, an absolute customer service professional!!", "Recently I stayed at the Houston Crowne plaza river oaks and I can describe my stay nothing short of fantastic! I was there for a training event with a great group of people! I had the opportunity to interact with the front desk staff a bit as well as Mandy the MOD/Concierge. They were all more than accommodating and took the next step to ensure I had everything I needed. I was given personalized suggestions of where to go hang out and have a little fun on my time off. The hotel decor is very nice for that of an older hotel! I ordered room service each night and had the same room service girl who remembered me and used my name each time. You can tell service is an important thing instilled in each and every employee at this hotel. I give my congrats and best wishes to the entire hotel and staff! Keep up the great work because you certainly met all my needs and made me leave feeling great about my stay! Thanks again. And special thanks to Mandy for all her help in making me feel comfortable and entertained ;-).", "Recently, I had the privilege of an overnight stay at this exceptionalhotel. (with several others) The hotel employs an unusually courteous and respectfulstaff. One of our employess had lost a watch. The concierge couldnot have been more concerned. She telephoned to say that theydid indeed have the watch, and sent it to my home at no cost to me. Wow!!The watch was not expensive, however, these are tough economic times,and well, it becomes costly to replace lost items.We had an opportunity to eat breakfast in the morning.The buffet was simply outstanding. It was such a pleasurable experience.The rooms are beautifully appointed, clean and comfortable.We could not have been more satisfied with this hotel.Again, the concierge did more than she had to, and it has left a lastingimpression on us. We would highly recommend this hotel. Thank You.", "Our company travels every day of the week and are in Houston at least once a month, if not more. We all love to come to the Crowne, the banquets staff is the best in the U.S. Everyone one of them are the best ever. They are all set up first thing in the morning and are there for you every minute of the day to make sure you are taken care of. I have never seen a staff this wonderful. If you ever need to have a conference or meeting in Houston, go to the Crowne and check them out. You won't be disappointed. The other hotel staff are great too, from the minute you check in, until the minute you check out, they are there to help you.", "Let's just say the staff is the most hospitable and efficient you can hope for. Any problem or assistance needed is immediately addressed with friendliness and courtesy only a 4 star hotel provides. Thank you Shaila and Nitashah for being great at the front desk and Mandy who is always ready to assist and provide the best places to go in town and help with anything you might need. I must congratulate Jackie Frank, the front desk manager for being the best in the business who addresses all problems and needs with warmth and courtesy. We can't wait to go back to Houston for more of that fabulous hospitality. Thank you all for a fabulous stay. The location of the hotel is perfect and easy to get around. There are many great restaurants nearby and the convention center is a short distance away.", "Stayed a couple of nights. The place is pretty far from the International airport, about 60 odd miles, but then Houston is pretty spread out. The hotel is not located in the downtown area but is about 7-8 miles I guess, which is ok. Overall, the hotel is an excellent 4 star property. The buffet breakfast served is pretty good as well. The front desk in particular is awesome. They went out of their way to help guests. Rooms are well kept, a little bit darker, but all that can be ignored. If downtown visits isn't your priority, this hotel is excellent and value for money for a 4 star. There are several restaurants just across the freeway. If you are looking for an Indian meal, a veg South Indian restaurant \"Madras Pavilion\" is just 2 min walk from the hotel as well around the corner.", "I stayed there for the first time last year (2011) and I can not believe I forgot to post a review..I am currently in the Military and I come home for a visit a lot since returning from Afghanistan, I choose to stay in a hotel for the comfort and quietness that my family lacks. I tell you what, from the time I cheched in to the time I checked out, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. From the hot shower, to the soft pillows and the quiet hall ways...Being in the military, I travel and it has taken me a long time to find my \"just right\" hotels...This is it!! The ONLY thing I can say bad or not happy with is the Parking, we have to pay for that...Other than that, I am booked for June 2012 already!! I can't wait...", "I was looking for somewhere not too big and not to small to host a baby shower. I talked to mandy the concierge who told me about their hospitality suites they have available that is perfect for showers and parties. Saw it and loved it not to mention the hotel was very accommodating to all my wants and needs. Through out my party they checked on us to see if we needed ice, trash taken out and etc. The valet guys were great help with helping us unload and loading the cars. Plus I got great compliments on how it was such a good idea to have it in a suite!! Overall we had a great time at the Crowne Plaza and thank the staff for helping make this exciting event run smoothly and fun!!", "We have made several trips to Houston for my mother to have treatments at MD Anderson. First, I appreciate the reduced rate for patients. We found the hotel through the hospital and have been very pleased with each of our stays. We like the fact that there is a restaurant on premises so we don't have to go out. The food is good and the staff is wonderful and very caring. I especially look forward to seeing Asmer when we dine. The hotel is clean and bright and the entire staff is extremely helpful and friendly each and every stay. When we had questions about the shuttle service to the hospital, or just about the area, Shayla, Pierre, and Christopher have been kind and sincere in their efforts to help. We really feel like they are glad to see us! Thanks to Jackie Frank for assisting my mom and to Debbie Hollier, as well. The employees here have made a very difficult time as comfortable as it can be considering the reason we are there. Thanks for all you do for MD Anderson patients. It means more than I can say!", "My husband is a patient at MD anderson. We have stayed at Crowne Plaza on two occasions and will be staying again next month for 8 days. After a flight to Houston and a cab ride to this hotel, we were greeted by the friendliest young lady by the name of Shaila. She was most helpful in accommodating all of our needs. Before arriving, she had already noted we might have medical needs and had placed us near an elevator. I cannot tell you how much this helped my husband. Thank you Shaila! I would also like to thank Debbie Hollier for helping us with reservations. You can feel the dedication of these two young ladies to their jobs and helping their clients. Crowne Plaza is lucky to have both of you. Rachel RuddockAlabama", "I was in town on business and decided to stay here since they had excellent rates and a great bonus deal which included a $50 gas card per each night of my stay. The service is great and you will realize this as soon as you walk in the door. Every staff member was very accomodating. If you are a priority club member try to go on Wednesday nights as they have a welcome event which provides a great networking opportunity and a chance to win priority club points. For all you point junkies out there, they also have up to 10,000 bonus points for your stay! There is a reason why this hotel is ranked high in Houston! I will definitely be back when I am in the area again!", "I celebrate the anniversary of my first kiss with my girlfriend. Her best friend that I had not yet met since she lives in a different state needed a medical procedure so my girlfriend took her to Houston to get it done. I had to do something to let my girlfireind know I was was thinking about her. I called the hotel - they put me in Mandy's hands. Mandy gave me some places to call for flowers - she knew exactly what i needed to do. Mandy made sure the flowers got to my girlfriend and the florist she recommended was incredible!! Mandy later met my girlfriend and made me out to be a HERO! I cannot thank Mandy enough or the rest of the staff that were so nice and friendly. They did a great job of taking care of their guests!! Awesome experience.", "I arrived at the Hotel to attend a conference with 16K participants. When my reservation was checked, Pierre stated that it was cancelled. Being a little taken, I stated that I had a confirmation two days before I arrived. It was brought to my attention that the credit card that I gave him was cancelled. I cancelled the credit (for personal reasons), forgetting that I had put the reservation on that card. After I explained that I drove from New Orleans, I was thinking there was \"no room at the Inn.\" Alas! Pierre came to my rescue. A situation that was all my fault, but in the end I was helped and was put up for the conference. It is a story that I have told several times, and each time it let me know that Pierre came to my rescue!!!!! Hats off to Pierre!!!!!!!", "I enjoyed the stay while in Houston during 10/19-23 for a Women's Conference, the hotel is beautiful, clean and the Reception Desk people were great, very friendly and courteous. The rooms are spacious. The Hotel is centrally located, close to shops and restaurants. Just want to highlight to wonderful ladies: Miss Gwen who was the greeter and the first person to take care of me while I was checking in, she was wonderful and also want it to mention Mandy; who was in charge of transportation, Mandy did an excellent job trying to accommodate all the women to go back and forth to the church where the conferences will take place, Mandy walked the extra mile to help and organize all of us. I am very grateful for her patience. Thank you Mandy! Thank you Gwen!", "I stayed here for 3-weeks as a patient at one of the nearby facilities. The shuttle service was excellent, and I saved money knowing I didn't need to rent a car during my stay. The room was chic, clean, and the bed was especially comfortable. The room's refrigerator and microwave was convenient and functional. The amenities were excellent. Being that I stayed here by myself, I was also able to socialize at the downstairs sports bar and restaurant. The food was excellent, and the breakfast buffet was superb! The buffet was very affordable and included an omelette and pancake/waffle bar, with those being made to order. All staff were very friendly and helpful, starting from the Concierge, front-desk staff, restaurant staff, and room service. AND, as a Priority Club member, I was able to attend their weekly afternoon gathering in their prime suite every Wednesday from 5:00-6:30p. High Standards!", "I travel to Houston frequently on business (and the rest of the state for that matter) and I know I have a choice in hotels! I prefer the Crown Plaza River Oaks because of the location and the amenities. I am always greeted with a smile by the front desk staff and the rooms are very clean. It has easy access off and on HWY 59 and the breakfast choices are fantastic. And if you do not want to go out at nite to eat they a have an excellent dinner selection and a bar for the adult beverages. We have even stayed at this location on weekends because of the friendly atmosphere and location. They even have conference Rooms for you next business meeting, give it a try and tell them you heard it here on TripAdvisor!!", "I gave this property a top rating because it ticked all the boxes for me. I just wanted a base for 3 nights in new york in a central location and it was great. Granted the decor was a bit dated but room was very clean and bed was huge and very comfortable. Staff on reception were very helpful and friendly even though they were under huge pressure always queue's but from arrival to check in mid afternoon it was 30 mins which was fine. If you want a fancy hotel in NY you will pay big money I prefer to spend mine on shopping...... I would definitely stay there again you are right across road from penn station and subway which was very handy the express bus from JFK drops you to penn station for $15.50.", "When visiting New York this is always the place I book. Right in the center of it all, the Hotel Pennsylvania could not be more perfect. First off, you are right dead smack in the middle of the city once you check in. From the hotel you can walk to wherever you need to be, or jump on one of the many train lines that are just a block or two away. I spend so much time in NY out and exploring the city that I am barely in my room. Mostly I just use it to relax a little at night and watch tv, and to sleep and shower. This hotel is perfect for me. The rooms are always quiet and CLEAN! And did I mention the price is right for New York City! You will not beat the value you get here.I would recommend this hotel for business travelers as well as families. The staff is always helpful and I never have any trouble checking in. Also, the pizza restaurant on the side of the hotel has great sausage slices if you get a chance to have one, and is also open VERY late!", "Hotel was very good, the reception was very nice and had many seats so you could sit down after a long day out in the city. The staff were very friendly and helped you whenever you needed it. The staff who advised you about the local trips and sights are extremely nice and know it alls, they know everything so ask them anything and they will help you. The room was a great size, there was no bed bugs and the rooms where all clean, and cleaned everyday. The hotel is in a great location, 20 min walk to times square and 10 mins from empire state. If you are going to New York this is the hotel, great price, great location and great hotel.", "I found my stay in the hotel last week a really great experience. The location could not of been any better it was so central to everything in New York. It was cheap and a bargain in my opinion. it was cleaned every day and the bed made. fresh towels and the bins were emptied. i dont know what people want when you are only spending the amount of money that we did but i would recommend it and would definitely stay there again. if you want luxury then spend the money and get luxury. at the end of the day you are in the city that never sleeps it was ideal and comfy to sleep in and somewhere to shower. you do not go to new york to sit in the hotel room. it does not deserve any of the bad reviews that it got and i myself was a bit worried about staying there after reading the reviews. i am very glad that i didnt take them seriously and went to see for myself.", "Stayed over new year, was a little scared before I went as read other reviews- I am not massively fussy but I want somewhere clean. (Having read some of the previous reviews I took slippers as I was scared of standing on the floor!!!) However, in my opinion it was fine. A little run down, but in a kind of charming way! Perfectly clean and functional and the location is second to none. I would definitely stay here again. They don't let you check in until 3pm but we just left our luggage in the storage area (about $4) and came back later- didn't have to queue. The lobby is lovely. May have just been very lucky given some of the other reviews but it is possible to have a nice visit to this place!", "five nights in NY could be very expensive, but the Penn is the perfect place to stay. Is a big hotel more than 1000 rooms ( I guess), I booked the 5000 pen with breakfast included. The room was quiet tiny for the no-european standard, but confortable.: two single beds, closet with iron board and a lot of space for luggage, sat tv, bathroom with tube.....everything do you need after a busy day between shops and museum. The breakfast was served in a room: coffe, thea, bagles, muffin, jam...everything you need to satrt a new day!!!I think that in NY is better to save money for shopping( a lot of shopping) so Penn hotel is THE PLACE!the location is perfect, few block from Time Square, I've never use the metro ( I prefer to walk or call a cab) but there is the metro station in fron of the hotel.The room was clean and the amenities good.I'll come back again.", "This hotel was just fine and served its purpose. We got a cheap package deal; the price was right and the location is perfect, right smack dab Midtown with subway stops steps away. I imagine this hotel was quite grand in its day. The building has been declared a historical landmark (to prevent tear-down) but so far none have stepped up to put $$$ into it for renovation. Yeah, our room was shabby, the baseboards were scuffed, the bathroom lavatory was missing a leg but so what. Everything was clean and the bed was comfortable. Nary a bedbug to be found. The shower was forceful with plenty of hot water and our room, located at the rear of the hotel was blessedly quiet. I'd stay here again for sure. It had a pleasant haunted vibe and the staff provided good service.", "There are some terrible reviews but i was extremely pleased. The room was nice, good bed, great bathroom, shower was brilliant. I have heard there are some rooms that arnt nice but we where on the 2nd floor and the room was spotless and decorated to the finiest quality.The location is great, 5 min walk to times square, 5 mins to empire state building.Also next to a subway station and railway station so new york sites are easily reachable. it look 10 mins on the subway to reach statue of liberty and 20 mins on the train to reach the airport. i read the reviews and upon opening my room door i was dreading the room, but i was so suprised.this was my first trip to new york.....i would deffinately go back and would 100% stay here again. maybe we got lucky with the room i dont know, but take the chance! Also cheap cheap cheap!!!!!!", "My boyfriend and I booked our long weekend getaway stay at the Hotel Pen based on the recommendation of a friend who frequently travels to NY. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a hotel with a great location at a reasonable price. Next to Pen Station, it was easy to get to the hotel from Newark Airport by public transportation. It is a stone's throw away from my favorite attractions', the Empire State Building. My boyfriend is also a huge sports fan / wanta be musician, we enjoyed being next to Madison Square Gardens. There was always something exciting happening 24/7!!!! We spent the days walking around the city, recuperated for a couple hours by watching tv and then headed out for a fun night on the town. The room was clean, spacious and an awesome location ....exactly what we needed for a fun and relaxing weekend in the big apple!", "I stayed in this hotel at the start and finish of our holidays in the states, we paid more then the basic rate for the first three nights and got a lovely room on the 11th floor, it was spacious, clean and very quiet. On our return stay we paid less and we got a smaller room on a lower floor, not the best room but I thought it was fair, considering the fantastic location and how cheap the hotel was. If you like fresh paint and a spacious room, then dont go for the cheapest room available, you really do get what you paid for here ! The location of this hotel was soo good, we walked everywhere. It was perfect for us.", "It really is'nt that bad remember. That you are paying for what you get the location is perfect.The hotel is in a prime location, 5mins walk from anything of interest and 2secs from penn station to take you anywhere further, for the price you pay for this hotel you cant ask for any better, i come to new york every year and always try and stay in this hotel the years i have been unable to stay in this hotel i have been extremely dissapointed if you think this is bad go and stay in the new yorker then you will be able to Complain!!! just go to new york and enjoy your self just remember while your there shopping and site seeing how long will you actually be spending in the hotel?", "You can't really ask for a better location in Manhatten. Directly across from Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building and 5th Avenue Shopping is directly behind the hotel. Times Square is 5 min walk. Subway is across the road, so perfect location for a hotel. Lobby is huge, Rooms were huge. We had 3 double beds in our room. The rooms do look a bit dated, it's an older style hotel, so don't expect a plasma tv, buts its got everything you need. Only complaint is the shower, took 3-4 min for hot water to come, and the water pressure was very very very high. Shower was abit small, but good enough. Can't stress how good it was to be in this part of Manhatten, you can just walk outside the hotel and theres heaps of things to do. Would definatley stay here again. Great value, If you can afford it, get the Affina Hotel, which is next door.", "This hotel is centrally located for anything worth doing in New York City. I went there with my girlfriend and we both loved this place. It is undoubtedly old but this just adds to its charm as far as I am concerned. The staff were efficient and friendly and although (as many other reviewers have pointed out) the check-in queue was a mile long, they worked really hard to keep things moving. In a city like NY most people will be spending a great deal of their time out and about so all you really need is somewhere to lock your bags and get your head down for a few hours a night. This hotel is perfect for that. Nice comfy bed as well!", "i would just like to say that this hotel was a great surprise!after reading the awful reviews about it on this website i was very nervous!however the hotel turned out to be excellent.the location is excellent, you step outside the door and madison square gardens is cross from you and macys is beside you. it was easy to walk to all the different attractions in new york!the hotel was very comfortable. the only problem is that the hotel is a bit dated but at the end of the day who cares!the beds were very comfortable and the shower always had piping hot water. i must say i thoroughly enjoyed my stay and i would highly recommend it. i am planning on going back to new york nxt year and i will defintly be staying in this hotel again!!!!!!!!", "We stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania for 3 nights in early October (Columbus day weekend, as we found out when we were there!) and it was brilliant! We were there as part of our honeymoon, and although I had mentioned it in the notes when we booked online, we were too tired to mention it when we were checking in! Nevertheless, the lovely lady who checked us in (in the Penn 5000 room) upgraded us to a 2 room suite! It was fantastic! Even a kitchenette in there!We loved the sightseeing of New York and the location of the hotel was just perfect, you can't go wrong! Everything is at your doorstep!And of course we were addicted to Starbucks, and the DELICIOUS ginger cookies they have in the NY stores only! so good!!!anyway, for the short time we were there, we found everything to be fantastic and have not one complaint!", "This hotel is in the middle of it all! And it offers affordable rooms. We upgraded to a Club Level room which are on the top two floors of the hotel. We had breakfast with great food/coffee/internet, inc in the upgrade. Also our room had two fab views and windows one of the Empire State Building. The check in was excellent and when our TV wouldn't work we were helped by hotel staff instantly and effectively. I would and will stay again at this old world hotel. The lobby is beautiful and grand and our room was large and clean. I don't know why people are complaining about chipping paint and green towels. I liked my stay and the hotel and had a great experience here. We left or luggage with the hotel after check out to sightsee some more and everything was in order. I got more then I expected and had a great stay here. I suggest you upgrade your room for a slight upcharge the breakfast and lounge itself is worth it.", "Travelled to New York for fun weekend break with brother hoping to see all the sights of the big apple so a good location to base ourselves was a high priority. We had read reviews on this hotel and were a bit worried. However, we found that although the hotel rooms are very basic, they are clean, secure and we found no major problem. The location of the hotel is the best thing though-it is centrally located in manhatten and in easy reach of all means of travel. Everything you could want is in the immediate area (as is probably the case with anything in new york!).So basically, don't believe all the negative reviews that you may have heard about this hotel-if you are unhappy with your room, apparently the staff are more than happy to relocate you to another room; so just ask. But like I have said, we were more than happy.", "WOW i was so apprehensive as to whether or not to stay in this hotel, after all the awful reviews i had read!it looks amazing on the hotels website, so i rang the manager and he assured me i would get a great room, as they were renovating the hotel, he explained why some of the reviews i had read may have been of a distasteful nature!!OMG i think we got the best room available, very spacious, maids v. pleasant and the place was spotless when we arrived back each evening!the desk staff were more than helpful and v friendly!And to top it all off My Fiance proposed to me in central park!I am DEF goin back next year for my anniversary!GREAT HOTEL!!!!", "Our trip to New York for a career forum held next to Hotel Pennsylvania got off to a sour start when our flight out of LasVegas was cancelled due to bad weather in other parts of the country. We finally arrived at the hotel at 2 in the morning, without our luggage! My son asked the receptionist if there were two beds in the room and she took the extra time to find a room with two beds as he requested. The vintage decor of the halls and rooms was so charming. The beds were very comfortable and the halls were always free from clutter. The next morning when I asked about the Internet connection, the receptionist recommended we use the business center on our floor where we could also have a continental breakfast. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and really made us feel at home with their hospitality. This was my second visit to New York in six months, and I must say that I would recommend Hotel Pennsylvania over the more expensive hotel where I stayed in August. Hope to be a loyal customer in the coming years.", "I stayed at this hotel last week for the remaining 3 nights of my trip to NY beacsue the original hotel booked was awful we had to move.I found the hotel staff very helpful and I was upgraded free of charge to a more superior room, the room was much larger than expected, clean and very comfortable. A couple of friends had stayed here previosuly and had said it was great value and clean, they were not happy with the first room they were given, complained and were given a much bigger room.I think the higher up you go in this hotel the better the rooms, I was on floor 13 out of about 18.For the money it's a great place to stay and somwhere you'd take your parents, friends or partner.I'd definitely book this hotel again and not bother researching others, what you see on their website (photos etc) is exactly what you get.", "I dont understand why people are complaining so much about this hotel. When my family and I went I was 15 and had a great time. The hotel staff was amazing at helping us find things around the city. The room was a little smaller than I thought, but you are not in NYC for the hotel. The hotel was clean, and welcoming. Also this is the best location for a hotel to be!! It is by everything! Times square is walking distance, and shopping is just a miniutes walk! I had a great experience at this hotel, and I am planning on staying here in april. I hope that everyone can please ignore the rude comments, this is a great hotel to stay at.", "After reading reviews about this hotel my two companions and I were really worried . We arrived and found the hotel reception staff more than helpful and very friendly. The 3 of us were sharing a room and we had asked for a fold up bed. We asked at reception and within 10 minutes a bed had been delivered. We were in room 1012a and the room was spotlessly clean, large and airy. The bathroom was immaculate - though to be true there was a cracked tile!!The bedding and towels were changed every day and again they were all spotlessly clean. The location was terrific. The only drawback i had was when we came back to the hotel each night - someone kept moving it back a few blocks - or at least my feet felt it had!We wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else and if anyone wants to check with me they are more than welcome!!Maureen", "We were concerned when we read other reviews with bad reports about this hotel - we need not have worried. On checking in we were offered a large room or a smaller but recently renovated room. We chose the renovated room and were very happy with it, clean, comfortable and enough room. Staff were good and check-in/out where no problems although the reception is very busy most times. We really enjoyed our stay in NY and at the Pennsylvania. This is a large hotel with >2,000 rooms and I believe the room quality can vary a lot depending on how recently they were last renovated, ask for a renovated room at check-in. The hotel is old (1916) and has had 27 million visitors since then. The location is great and we would not hesitate to stay there in the future. See the photo for the view from our room. Enjoy New York.", "Me and my partner stayed at this hotel for 3 nights!! We had an amzing trip!! The hotel was great if you are only stayin there a short time and all you want to do is explore!! As you can imagin when visiting NEW YORK you are rarely in your hotel... its just like a base!! The hotel was very busy and not that welcoming and the room basic! However..... I had the best time ever on my trip... it doesnt matter what hotel you stay in as there are sooo many things to do and see!! I would recommend this hotel if you are not looking to spend a great deal of time in your room!! Plus great location!!!", "We stayed here for 4 nights and can honestly say we had no problems with it . If you are looking for 4 star accomodation then pay 4 star prices but if you are looking for a large clean room with sheets and towels changed daily then this is the place for you.You will not find a better location for the price of this hotel.The staff are friendly and there is a coffee shop and restaurant attatched. There is also a small bistro type place that called lyndys that claims to have world famous cheese cake ..... we had coffee and a slice each and for the 2 of us the bill was $36.50 ..... they should tell you it's the price and not the taste that is famous.Will be booking for new york for next year as soon as it goes on sale and it will be the penn hotel i will be booking and recomending to my friends to do likewise.", "im just after returning from the big apple and we stayed in new york's hotel pennsylvania, we went for 5 days and it was the best 5 days we had,the hotel is lovely, the staff are helpful & friendly, our hotel room was huge there was 2 double beds in it plenty of space for all the shopping, it is a bit old fashioned but it didnt bother us its what you make of it yourself for all the time you'd spend in the hotel room anyway.ii is so central to everything it' s across the road from madison sq gardens 10 mins from empire state building, the mahattan mall is only around the corner from the pennsylvania hotel, times square is just down the road rockefeller centre is only about 15 mins away all worth goin to, its brillant, i would definitely go back in the morning without a doubt i just fell in love wit the city", "We styed at this hotel from 2-7 sept and i loved it, i am depressed since i am home, fair enough when you check in there was bit of a que we waited about 20 minutes before it was our turn to check in after all its such a big hotel you have to expect this bit of delays and there was 5 people working at the receiption desk.

I stayed last november and left positive feedback. Once again im leaving positive feedback!The location is the best thing about this hotel, it is smack bang in the middle of a lot of great shops, opposite penn station and madison square garden.We waited about 5 mins to check in and found our receptionist pleasent and professional. We were given a room on the 14th floor and we had a huge room with two double beds, average size bathroom, and lots of room for suitcases etc. The bed had clean sheets and pillows, the carpet could do with a good hoover but not so bad and the bathrooms are old but clean. Overall the rooms are fine, considering the amount of time you are actually in your room.The first time i stayed and had a good experience i thought we were just lucky to have a good room after reading the reviews but this time we were once again given a fab room! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is on a short,shopping/sightseeing break to the city and wants inexpensive accommodation. I will be staying at the pennsylvannia again!", "Stayed at this hotel specifically because of it's superb location, and Madison Square Gardens venue right across the road where I had tickets for a band. Was taken aback at the splendour of the huge, glistening lobby. Found my room to be quite large compared to other more expensive hotels I've stayed in, in this city. Apart from the brown carpet (not my colour) I thought the room to be very clean, spacious and cosy. I had all the room facilities I needed - iron, hairdryer, bath AND shower, tv and radio. For the excellent rates I paid, I can not fault this place one bit, in fact I've told anyone I know who is thinking of going to New York - to stay here!", "I was excited to go to NEW YORK, but a little scared too because of what I read about this hotel...When we arrived, I was astonished !! What a big hotel !!!!! And very well situated. The lobby is wonderfull. There are like 12 elevators that can take you to your room ! About our room, it was nice. We had an amazing view on the street and the buildings. The bathroom was clean : toilets, shower...Everything was OK ! The two beds were clean and comfortable, we had the TV...I liked this hotel a lot. Next time I'm going to NEW YORK, I go back to this hotel. This hotel is nice and not expensive! It is situated in the heart of MANHATTAN, close to the subway. I loved it !!!!", "I was very apprehensive about staying here after reading reviews, especially because I was going to be there for a night by myself before my partner arrived.The lobby is fantastic and so was our room. After reading reviews I requested a refurbished room above the 9th floor. We stayed on the 11th and the room was lovely. Small but brand new super king and super comfy bed. News drapes and furniture, big TV, desk and plently of closet space. Bedroom was serviced each day and linen was lovely and new. Hotel is very central and there is a restaurant in the building if you can't be bothered going out to eat every night. It is one of the oldest and largest hotels in NY which further adds to it's charm.", "We stayed for 7 nights in May 2006.I've stayed here twice before, so I know it aint exaclty the best hotel in the world. We checked in, queued for around 5 mins max. Had a room on the 2nd floor. After reading everything on here...........i was like ohhhhhh no, we are under the 5th floor, thats bad. We got to the room. IT WAS HUGE. 2 double beds, 3 walk in wardrobes. 21inch TV. Fridge. Everything was clean and tidy. I personally think the floor was getting done up at the time mind, there were painters around in the corridors all week. NYC you basically need a place to shower and crash, thats all we wanted. WE GOT ALOT MORE THAN THAT. IF you go to NYC and worry about what the inside of the hotel is like, its kinda worrying. You sleep in the hotel and thats about it.Excellent location.............and I will stay they again for the 4th time, probally next yearX", "I can't believe all the bad reviews I've read, its a cheap hotel! What exactly were you expecting?!I went in Feb 06 and happened to be staying over the period of the dog show which made it very busy, but it was still a briliant stay, staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were very clean, everything worked, it was comfortable, I had no problems whatsoever I spent a week there with my friend and because of the snow we did spend a lot of time in the hotel, the corridors do make u think it is going to be dreadful, but there rooms are fine!All in all, I had a briliant stay and nothing whatsoever to complain about....If you book a cheap hotel, don't expect 5 *", "Anyone who has just booked here and is now worried, Don't be. My family and I stayed here in march this year, and obviously we were expecting something from the shining from all the accounts we had read!! Checked in at about 6pm, no queues and really friendly staff. Got straight into a very new lift that took us to the twelfth floor, where we found our room, tidy, clean and most importantly comfortable and secure. We had hot running water at all times of day. It snowed heavily while we were there so the warm cosy beds were heaven after a long day of sightseeing! Lobby is beautiful, Staff are efficient, sure the hotel is old and maybe some rooms sould do with a lick of paint, but remember there are 1700 rooms, and you are not paying plaza prices! for 100 a night, a central location, handy for just about everywhere, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG!! STAY HERE!", "My family and I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania in NY City while my daughter ran in the NY Marathon.There were a lot of other Marathon runners staying there too. They too must have been on tight budgets like us.We had a total of 8 people staying in 4 different rooms. I stayed from 3 nites, and the others stayed a week and went shopping and further sight seeing.We had great service from the Front Desk Manager making arrangements to stay there, all the way through to housekeeping and until check out.Our room had two beds, nice curtains, lamps, and etc. a couch, and a large walkincloset with an ironing board and iron in it. The hotel is located directly across the street from Madison Square Gardens,one block from Macy's, several blocks from Time Square and etc. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to save $50 to $100 per night and use that on the finer sights of New York. Call the hotel, and tell them what type of room meets your needs and they will comply with your requests.", "Este hotel  muito bem localizado, pois fica bem em frente ao Madison Square Garden e a Penn Station, com acesso a transporte publico para qualquer lugar de New York e do pais.

La stazione si trova sotto il Madison Square Garden, per altro centro di snodo della metro che a NY  davvero fenomenale. Altra nota positiva del Pennsylvania  che se siete fortunati proprio dietro si erge il mitico Empire State Bld, quindi se vi capita una buona camera come  successo a me, vi svegliate ed andate a dormire con uno dei pi favolosi e classici simboli di NEW YORK, nonch uno spettacolo di panorama.", "L'hotel Penn  terribilmente vecchio.

When we arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly young lady at the front desk, who made our check-in quick and painless. Our room was clean, comfortable, and had an aura of class and distinction. Our wake-up call came exactly on time and the breakfast downstairs was excellent.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely return in the future.", "We recently stayed at the Sheraton Gateway on our trip to Los Angeles, and we couldn't have been happier with our stay! From the second we walked in the lobby, we were treated like family. Our room was spacious and modern. We had the suite, and there was room to stretch out and really relax.

The staff were all very cordial and friendly, and made it very easy to settle in. I'll definitely be coming back.", "My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles last week while he was attending a convention. We had to change rooms because the room to which we were initially assigned had a toilet which did not work. We spoke to the manager and she was very quick to find us a new room (with a larger bed, in fact) and it all amounted to a delay of a few minutes. Most everything was clean, comfortable, and to my expectations overall. The only point of contention I had was having to pay $13 a day for wireless internet access; this is an amenity almost everyone offers for free these days and charging what amounts to almost a week's worth of my home internet bill seemed unreasonable. All in all, I found the experience to be satisfactory, I just wish that they would not be so stingy with the internet access. If so, we would happily stay at the Sheraton LA next time we're in the city.", "from the moment I walked in the door I knew it was going to be a great trip!  The Valet and doorman were both prompt and pleasent, The front desk was quick and efficient, when I got to my room I melted into the bed(it was amazing!)

Had a great time at the casino nearby and spent a lot of time at the pool in the sun... they were so good about all the towels I used!  I am a late riser and was not once bothered by housekeeping either!  Definitely will recommend to all my friends and family.", "If you want to enjoy the happening city of Los Angeles in its full grandeur and splendor, stay in Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel. The hotel is conveniently located in close proximity of Los Angeles Airport where a complimentary shuttle came to take me to a 50000 sqft property with 802 guest rooms. The moment I entered the hotel property, awesome was the word that came out. With that many rooms, I do not think it will ever turn a guest down. However, I found the hotel very busy, still its check-in was very fast. The speedy elevators took me to my floor quickly. The room had natural light and was quite spacious. I could not have imagined that a hotel room in Los Angeles could be so spacious. The room was neat and clean. Its linen choice was immaculate. Television and refrigerator were located at an angle to the bed and I found that very interesting. The bed was very cozy. I found the concept of two bathrooms in the hotel room very interesting. The bathrooms were spacious too. The closet had at least 10 hangers for me to conveniently hang all my clothes. What I found equally interesting was the presence of a separate closet for shoes and used clothes. The room offered a very nice view to the city through its balcony. The presence of four chairs and a table allowed me to hold a business meeting in my room. I was pleasantly surprised by the positive response of the hotel when I had inquired if the hotel could offer me complimentary milk instead of coffee at nights during my stay in the hotel. Overall, for the price they charged, my stay in the hotel was very comfortable.", "I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles for a business meeting and my boss treated me to a suite. I was pleasantly surprised to find out about the 24-hour room service. Since my flight arrived in the middle of the night, it was great to have the option of dinner when everywhere else was closed. This Sheraton has rooms for business meetings on site, so it was a real treat to just have to take the elevator down a few flights in the morning. It saves a lot of the hassle of car rentals and taxis, especially with Sheraton's shuttle from LA International.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't bring my swimsuit - that heated pool looked very inviting!", "Review: Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles\n\nIs located blocks from the Airport, the hotel provides a shuttle for guest to and from to the airport or hotel.

We had never been to the area before and were looking for suggestions/directions/advice and the hotel staff was very knowledgeable about many of the key tourist sites and gave us great restaurant recommendations. Along with being a clean, neat, up to date location, with a grade A staff, it was also unbelievably reasonable. It was so affordable that my husband and I vowed to go back again and take the kids next time!

I would definitely recommend this hotel and I'll be using it again in the future.", "I had an unexpected and irritating layover in LAX, but was relieved to get a room at the nearby Sheraton Gateway.

Next time I am heading to LA for business, I will certainly keeping this place in mind.", "My husband and I booked this hotel for its convenience to the airport and surrounding points of interest while on a mini vacation.

If you are in the Los Angeles area and looking for a place to stay by the airport, definitely stop by and check this out.", "I only stayed here for one night to attend a business meeting. Everything was to my expectations for a hotel of this rating and location. I actually didn't rent a car because it wasn't really necessarily since my meeting was just down the block but the on-site hotel was more than favorable and Starbucks was good in the morning. Overall I'd come back hopefully for a more lengthy stay.", "If you are going to be staying in the Los Angeles area, I highly recommend the Sheraton Gateway - especially if you're there for business. This hotel provides many different packages and even includes things such as a valet. I'm someone who is adamant about carrying my laptop with me everywhere, however the Sheraton Gateway provides computers, printers, and high speed internet access. This hotel made me comfortable enough to bring my business partners to me due to all of the beautiful meeting spaces in the building. Whether you're in Los Angeles for business or play, the Sheraton Gateway is the most luxurious place to stay - yet you still get the biggest bang for your buck.", "Absolutely beautiful. Lobby is decorated with modern furniture and lighting, giving a great first impression as you walk in the front doors. And the rooms continue this impression. They are large and comfortable.

Although we didn't spend too much time at the hotel, we did manage to enjoy the hotel's spa service before we left. My husband and I both got facials and a massage. This was our first visit to The Westin but it definitely won't be the last.", "I had the opportunity to stay at the Westin Los Angeles Airport hotel recently & was very satisfied with my stay. I generally try to stay further away from the airport, but my secretary booked me here for a last minute meeting I had to attend. \nFrom the moment the shuttle driver gave me a big smile as he loaded my bags to the warm greeting the hotel clerk gave me on checkout I was completely impressed. \nThe lobby/foyer was beautifully decorated in a modern style. I was booked in a junior suite, which was more than enough room for just me. The bed was better than the one I have at home, so I slept like a baby. Some of the other things that really stood out to me from my stay were the outdoor amenities. The warm & very clean pool with the palm trees (I'm from Boston) was nice & I was able to enjoy conversation with a co-worker by the fire pit on the outdoor patio, where a full bar was staffed not too far away. For dinner I had the Blackened Ahi Tuna Salad, which was comparable to any fine dining restaurant I've been to. I was also able to get into the Spa for their signature \"Be Well\" massage & facial. While I don't travel with my 120lb dog Bella often, it was nice to know they also offer pet massages! \nI would DEFINETLY recommend this hotel to anyone flying into or out of the Los Angeles area.", "This hotel was really lovely and comfortable with good service.

I'd highly recommend to anyone, from tourist to business person.", "While staying at The Westin Los Angeles Airport Hotel, I was suprised. I was not expecting their beds to be that comfortable and their service to be so on top of things. From the outside looking in, the hotel reminded me of a regular Embassy Suites. But once we were inside and checked in it was like one of those swanky New York hotels. The greeter at the desk was very pleasent and had everything set up ready to go. The rooms were the cleanest rooms I have seen in a long while. The sheets were so soft and smelled so great! I am a big stickler if my bed isn't super comfy and soft.

And we got the breakfast package thrown in, which was actually quite surprisingly tasty. We had breakfast at the hotel all three days during our stay, and everything was fresh and delicious.\n\nThe hotel staff was very accommodating. Every little request we had, from an extra towel to room service, was met with a smile. The spa staff was also extremely professional, and I had probably the best massage there.

Speaking of vacation, their 4-7pm happy hour at the bar was very nice and I had my fair share of discounted cocktails!", "I spend much of my time traveling for business. So comfortable accommodations while away from home are of paramount importance to me. I'm happy to say I found that and more at The Westin Los Angeles Airport. After a long (often boring and frustrating) meeting, I always feel the need to get a good run in to clear my head. The Westin's fantastic gym allowed me to do that in the safety of their hotel. The gym was top notch. The equipment was well-maintained and clean, not grimy looking as I've seen elsewhere. Afterward, I soaked in the hot tub and did a few laps in the pool. It was an extremely relaxing experience, which I topped off by treating myself to a Filet Mignon at the Daily Grill, located within the hotel. When I finally retired to my room, I was fully ready for a good night's sleep, which I got thanks to Westin's amazingly comfortable beds. After one night's stay, I was actually reluctant to leave! When I next travel to Los Angeles on business, you can bet I will be staying at The Westin Los Angeles Airport.", "From the friendly and accomodating staff to the nice clean room and wonderful bar and Daily Grill, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Westin LAX.

From dining to relaxing, you can fill every need all in one convenient location. After checking in all I wanted to do was relax, so I went ahead and treated myself to their one of kind spa. With so many forms of massage I didn't know which one to choose. Luckily for me their staff were well educated on all the services and helped me to make the right decision. After that I was starving, but I didn't feal like leaving the hotel. Looking back I'm glad I didn't, because their Daily Grill had everything I was looking for. Fantastic service and delicious food.\nAfter all that all I wanted to do was go to sleep. Talk about a great sleep, I don't think I've ever had such a wonderful rest. The rooms are quite and the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. \nThe only problem was the fact that I was there on business, which meant I had to get to work. After enjoying a triple latte mocha from the Starbucks, located right in the hotel, I had to get started. Although I did not know it, this place was going to help me again. They had a Fed Ex business center right on the second floor. They simplified all my business needs and actually saved me so much time that I was able to go back and enjoy the spa treatment again.\nAll in all, I would have to say that this was the best business trip of my life and I owe it all to the Westin Los Angeles Airport Hotel and Resort. And when it was time to leave they even had a shuttle that took me to the airport. I will never forget my trip nor will I forget all the helpful and friendly staff of the Westin.

I can comfortably say this was one of the best hotels I have stayed at. I was able to work out at the indoor gym while my girlfriend decided to go for a swim in the pool. The hot tub was incredible and we got one all to ourselves to spend a romantic evening together with some champagne. The cost was definitely lower than what the hotel was worth. I was genuinely surprised it was so cheap, because it felt like it was at least a 4 star hotel. The spa is worth checking out. The massages they give were to die for.", "The Westin Los Angeles is an excellent modern and comfortable hotel.

I have been on a workout plan 4 days a week, and I can continue that plan on my vacation with the hotel's brand new fitness center! The rooms have your basic essentials, mini fridge, coffee maker, voicemail, premium cable. Very close to Minute Maid park, which is handy to see the Houston Astros play! After Jeremy Lin and James Harden joined the Houston Rockets, the team became a contender for the title! I saw them play in the playoffs at the Toyota Center which was a great time! Overall it is a great place to stay, I recommend you check it out", "I recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza hotel while taking a weekend getaway and visiting some friends in the Houston area. I was very pleased with everything during my stay. The staff were extremely courteous and approachable and so I always felt like I would be well taken care of if I had any problems, which luckily I didn't! My room was clean and comfortable, and they have a great free shuttle service to the Galleria Mall which I loved! Will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Houston.", "I enjoyed my stay very much! The staff exceeded my expectations, they were very nice and courteous. The room was spacious, and the beds were REALLY comfortable. I loved how they designed everything, my room, the restaurant and even the lobby looked and felt wonderful. My room was also relaxing, i didnt have to listen to busy traffic all night. \n\nThe location is convenient, i was able to get a little shopping done, and go to a great restaurant. If im ever in Houston again, i will most likely stay here again! I loved it", "First of all, I would like to thank the hotel registration for being so helpful for such a short notice booking.  All of the other hotels in the immediate area had no vacancy and weren't helpful directing me elsewhere.  Knowing my dire need for a room for the weekend, Crowne Plaza Houston River Oaks took care with my reservation.  Every staff member was extremely helpful during my stay, especially the concierge. \nRooms are quite comfortable, with fantastic views of the metro area.  Even the pool had a great view, which is a plus.  Very hospitable staff made sure that I always was being served.  I can't wait to visit Houston again.  Excellent hotels are difficult to find at this value.  When the time comes to return, I will definitely be staying at the Crowne Plaza Houston River Oaks.", "This hotel truly lives up to the Crowne Plaza reputation for exceptional service to the business traveler. I stayed there four nights for a sales conference in the hotel. I had a long flight, then a long cab ride to get to the hotel. What a welcome sight! The lobby was immaculate and luxurious looking. As soon as I stepped in the door, I was greeted by each employee I passed. The front desk attendant was extremely gracious. She gave me an upgrade to a great room without my asking. The room was clean and welcoming. The view over Houston was stunning. The event rooms were spacious and modern, with large LCD screens for PowerPoint presentations. The business office had Internet, fax, and copy services, in addition to fresh coffee for the weary businessperson.  The location also is great. The hotel is within walking distance to great restaurants and evening activities.", "The Crowne Plaza Houston River Oaks is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location. If you are coming into town for an Astros or a Texans game this is the place to be! The hotel is minutes away from downtown Houston and all the shopping, plus the huge The Galleria Mall is just down the road. The lobby is fresh and beautiful with trees lining the walls so you feel relaxed and rejuvenated when you walk in. The rooms are spacious and look recently renovated with nice touches like flatscreen televisions and granite tabletops. If you're coming to Houston, this hotel is the place to stay.", "I stayed at the Crowne Plaza - Houston River Oaks - for several days last month when in the area on business.  Like other Crowne Plaza's I've stayed in, this one was super clean, with large rooms (at least mine was). I definitely appreciated the self-use laundry facilities because I like to pack light but prefer not to spend my life's savings on hotel laundry services. The internet connection was fast and easy to connect to, and the room was setup conveniently  for \"office\" use. I really appreciated the hotel's gym. While not large, it was well-equipped and clean. I didn't get to take advantage of the spa, but like that it's available if I had the time. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Clean, lovely rooms, with helpful staff.", "I stayed at Crowne Plaza Houston River Oakes for four nights as I was attending a conference for my company in Houston. I can honestly say that this was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at in quite some time.\n\nUpon check-in, I was presented with a welcome packet and a gift; the welcome packet contained a coupon for a free drink at the bar and a map of the local vicinity, which was nice because this was the first time I had visited Houston.\n\nMy room exceeded expectations. The room provided a beautiful view of Houston and was extremely clean. The beds and pillows were comfortable, and the showers produced hot water and included an adjustment shower head. There was an assortment of coffee in the room, which was good because I could brew a fresh pot in the morning while I was getting ready.\n\nThe staff was wonderful as well. Their recommendations of local restaurants were outstanding, and each morning they called with a prompt wake-up call so I wasn't late. In fact, they also organized transportation each day, whether it be a shuttle to the conference or airport or a taxi to the restaurants. They also took care of dry-cleaning for me as one of my suits was a little wrinkled from packing. They even left messages reminding me to contact them if I ever needed anything.\n\nThe business center contained up-to-date materials, the internet was always fast, the pool was clean and big, and I always felt at home when I was staying there. I know people talk about Texas hospitality, but the entire experience was above and beyond my expectations. I will definitely stay at the Crown Plaza Houston River Oaks in the future, and I hope you do too!", "Enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza/Houston River Oaks. Great Hotel. Location perfect for shopping and easy access to Southern-style entertainment. Rodeo! Ha! Has Wifi. Unfortunately, no pets but will refer you to nearby kennels for your furry children.

If any of our friends are ever in the area, we will be recommending your hotel.", "Wow, I cannot say enough about my stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Houston! First of all, I was traveling with my grandmother, who only speaks Hindi, but the staff has someone who speaks Hindi, so that was no problem!\n\nIn addition, the rooms were clean, spacious, and a great deal for the quality we received.

Next time I am in Houston, I know where I'm staying!!", "Our stay at the Crowne Plaza was exceptionally pleasant. We arrived late, but the receptionist and nighttime staff were ready, welcoming, and energetic in helping us get settled. That makes such a difference! \nThe real attraction of the Crowne Plaza is its location. My husband was in town for business, and appreciated the ease with which he could get to his downtown clients (Occidental and Chevron, for example, are not far from the hotel). I myself wanted to visit Rice University and the University of Houston -- also within fairly easy reach. But there's still more to the location: we decided to bring the children back here for a vacation, too, because it's just a brief drive to the zoo, the well-known Minute Maid Park, and a huge mall (the hotel runs a regular shuttle there and back). And, of course, the hotel has its own pool and fitness center.\nWe heard someone say that the Crowne Plaze is known as \"The Place to Meet in River Oaks\" -- and we can see why!", "I recently stayed here for my friend's wedding, and I highly recommend this hotel after my experience. I was impressed by the front desk at the get-go, because I had originally asked for a non-smoking room. But there was some sort of conference going on when I was in town, so they were really booked. They did not have any rooms in the range I book that were non-smoking. To accomodate me they upgraded me to a nice room at no extra charge. My room was huge and extremely comfortable. I slept like a baby! \n\nThe morning before I left, I had their buffet for breakfast which was delicious. The hotel was also in an area near a lot of resturants, so when I had to wait between the wedding and there reception, I had lots of ways to entertain myself.\n\nNext time I'm back in Houston, I would for sure stay here again!", "Our stay was excellent, awesome room, great location, perfect view and good people.  I really enjoyed staying at Crowne Plaza Houston River Oaks! It was very nice and so was our room! The staff was very nice as well. Overall our stay was great. Pool is awesome too.

I spend 3 nights there while I was on a business trip. As soon as I arrived, I was greeted warmly and checked in immediately. All the staff was always so cheerful and helpful. I chose to stay in the Suite, and it was perfect, very clean and spacious! I ate at the Reeds Restaurant everyday and never had a bad experience with their food or service. The location was great, you are just minutes away from so much, including Downtown Houston, the Houston Zoo, and Galleria Mall. The hotel also provides a complimentary bus service to such locations which is great for people like me who didn't want to rent a car. The pool was also really nice, maybe it was due to the time I stayed there, but it was never crowded and most of the times, I was the only one in it, which was really nice! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that needs a hotel near Downtown Houston, whether its for a week or just a night!", "This is an impressive looking hotel not far from downtown Houston.

The location could not have been better, right in the heart of the city all of the major sites I wanted to visit were very close by.

The minute I entered the hotel I was treated exceptionally well. The staff is just phenomenal. They seem to go above and beyond what you expect of them. The rooms are comforting and make you feel right at home. The pool is great and refreshing for those hot Houston summers. There is only one restaurant in the hotel but there are many places to eat around the hotel so that really isn't a big deal. All that being said I will make sure when I return to Houston for business or pleasure I will make sure to stay at the River Oaks.", "We travelled to Houston this past weekend.  Although a little pricey compared to the national chains, the rooms were magnificent!  We were actually glad we stayed at the Magnolia Hotel Houston, and the next time we visit the area, this is where we will be staying!", "The first thing that impressed me about this hotel was the professionalism of their website. I was able to easily book the room I wanted, and later change my reservation around with little to no hassle. What initially drew me to this hotel was the beauty and elegance of the architecture. At first I thought that a place this beautiful was going to cost me an arm and a leg, but I was surprised to find that it was cost effective and affordable. The customer service was another reason I decided to choose this hotel. When I called the front desk, I was not put on hold and was connected to a live person immediately who was very good at answering my questions thoroughly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the areas they are located.", "The Magnolia Hotel provided me and my girlfriend a very exciting weekend. The rates were reasonable and the experience was just extraordinary. We flew into Texas from Michigan and it didn\u2019t seem very far from the airport.

I can\u2019t wait to go back and hope to have the same experience all over again!", "My wife and I spent a few night in one of the Magnolia Hotel's suites. The room was not only spacious, but decorated and furnished with a real eye for customer comfort. The beds were extremely comfortable, and I had some of the best night's sleep I've had in months! After staying out a bit late to see a Texans NFL game, we were too tired to go out to eat, so we ordered room service. Again, Magnolia shone as the service was impeccable and the food tasted far above what the average room service food tasted like.

The architecture of the actual hotel was beautiful and helped me enjoy my stay that much more.", "The Magnolia Hotel in Houston is not just a temporary residence, but an experience. They have all the regular amenities, such as high speed internet and complimentary breakfast, but what makes the Magnolia exceptional is what the other places don't have.

It was very nice. \n\nThe bed? Very, VERY comfortable. It's odd, I always thought of my own bed as comfortable, but as soon as I got under the covers I wondered how they managed to make it so comfy. It was one of the best rests I've had in months, and for a business man, that says a lot. \n\nI didn't get a chance to check out their fitness center or pool, so I can't comment on those, but hey, they have them. \n\nA very stylish and comfortable hotel, if I'm ever in the Houston area again, I know exactly where I'm going.", "Magnolia Hotel Houston, a home away from home while working on business.

I must say, I'm glad I didn't stay with a friend like I initially intended to. The 3 day stay at the hotel during my work trip felt like a vacation during the toughest time of the year. It's located in the heart of the State of Texas... Houston. They say everything is bigger in Texas and this was no different. The food was first class and they served large portions.. the leftovers tasted just as good the next morning. The decor inside and outside of the hotel absolutely blew me away. I felt like the most important man alive for being there. They treat with you so much respect and the service from the workers is sublime.

First class all the way through.", "I recently stayed three nights at the Magnolia Hotel in Houston for a business trip and the stay was great in every way.

The hotel is one of the best that I've stayed at in the Houston Area and I've been coming here quarterly for the past 5 years.  The building itself is an the old post dispatch building and is exceptional.  It has the look of an old hotel with five star accommodations.  The concierge was able to help me get reservations at local restaurants and transportation to the airport, and around town to my business meetings.  The room was clean, modern and had a great view of downtown.  Overall, no complaints during my stay and I will definitely be coming back.", "My stay at the Magnolia Hotel Houston was excellent.

I found Magnolia Hotel on yelp and liked the look of the place; it has that 50's, 60's, swanky feel that feels authentic within the sprawling tech center that is Houston. In addition to the decor of the place, there's a restaurant that serves authentic Southern Style cuisine which I'm a fan of. You can't go wrong with a hotel in downtown Houston that's in walking distance of all the attractions Houston has to offer that is well priced and has a great rep!", "Beautiful hotel located in downtown Houston. Set amid a modern city, this hotel matches it's environment flawlessly while providing spacious meeting rooms, gorgeous views, and wonderful amenities.

They have an assortment of very nice conference rooms which served our company well as we stayed.

Taking care of children was funny and children felt very well. the pools were totally agreeable, also there was a water park, etc.. The food was great and there were Turkish gala evenings. The grill food was very delicious. At the beach bar, there were daily delicious pastries baked, just like pizzas. All in all, it was a nice vacation. We thank all workers of the Palomar Chicago. It is a hotel to be recommended", "My wife and I stayed at the Palomar Hotel in Chicago, and the stay was as luxurious and great as the website makes it look. I am a runner, but came during a snow storm so I used the indoor workout facility to get some miles in, and it was very clean and the TVs on each piece of equipment made it feel like a very high end gym.  After the workout, the wife and I dipped in the pool and it was very nice, but there isn't much to say about an indoor pool in Chicago.  \n\nChecking in was a breeze, and the lobby was very elegant and quiet too.  The staff was fantastic, friendly and looked like they were attentive and on their toes everytime we saw someone.  We stopped at the bar for a drink because it was snowing and didn't want to leave, but that turned out to be a good decision as the bartender and bar were both awesome.  The room was luxurious as well, the bed was ridiculously comfortable and they had all the amenities, like a fridge and a desk.  \n\nNext time I'm in Chicago I'll definitely stay here again, it is definitely worth the price.", "I was able to stay here when I was in Chicago for business and I wanted to say how beautiful this hotel is.  My room was wonderfully decorated and made me feel very cozy and at home and my views were gorgeous.  Like I said, I was in town for business, so I really appreciated the large desk and laptop safe for security.  I am also very health conscience so I was thankful for the opportunities to get my exercise in on this trip.  I took full advantage of the state-of-the-art fitness center and pool.  But when I was tight on time I would squeeze in some yoga in my room, thanks to the mat provided and tv channels.  I was also pleased to find not only an adjacent restaurant and bar, but a top-notch one!  It was so convenient for me to order room-service at whatever time I took a break. To be able to order scallops (my favorite) and other seafood was a plus.  In conclusion, my stay at this hotel was a welcome vacation while I work.", "I'd made our reservation online and everything went smoothly both on the site and checking in. The Palomar was incredibly elegant.  This was my first time staying in Chicago and I was amazed at how friendly and helpful the staff was, even though things were hectic for them with a lot of people trying to check in at once.  We had dinner at the Sable Kitchen and Bar on the mezzanine and had impeccable service with reasonably-priced four star quality food.  I found our suite to be spacious and so artfully decorated that I forgot we were even in a hotel. I can't believe how lucky we were to booked there for the weekend. I'll definitely use Kimpton hotels again the next time I'm traveling.", "This conveniently located downtown Chicago hotel provides all the standard amenities and then some. Adults will appreciate the modern chic design of the lobby and rooms, kids will love the indoor pool. Access to wifi and an adjacent well-rated restaurant are the cherries on top. This hotel has everything.", "I have stayed at the Palomar several times.  The first time I was just put there on accident when one of those travel booking websites messed up and gave me an upgrade...quite the upgrade though! I felt like royalty when I walked into my suite!  (You can tell you like a place when the first thing you do is start taking pictures. I had an awesome view of Chicago at night from my room.)  The staff is very polite and extremely accommodating. After the first time I was here, I made it a point to come back the next time I was in town, even though I had to pay full price I knew it was money well spent.  I even treated myself to a massage at the spa...here's a tip, even though some of the prices can be high, ask the lady there and they will often find you a deal.", "During my stay at Palomar Chicago, I felt like royalty. It was a feeling I would definitely recommend everyone have at least once in their life. Not only was their breakfast (that I had delivered to my room) very well prepared, but I was able to spend luxurious evening in the pool and then later socializing during the wine hour that the hotel hosts. I ended up making a few friends who were also on business trips. I must say that during my week long stay, the highlight of the day was always returning to the Palomar after a long day of business presentations. The hotel staff was very polite and accommodating. The atmosphere of the hotel is very uplifting and classy. I would highly recommend the Palomar Chicago for a weekend getaway, a honeymoon or just a place to stay while visiting the windy city.", "I greatly enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Palomar in Chicago!

My stay was during a personal vacation, and being so close to Downtown Chicago was wonderful. The lobby is absolutely beautiful; it's clear it was designed with a very modern look in mind. It's very open and inviting, and very bright and colourful unlike many other hotel lobbies that tend to be quite the opposite.\n\nI absolutely loved my room; it had a very modern and clean look. A surprisingly comfortable bed and an amazing bathroom don't even scratch the surface on how great this room was. Although I didn't need it, I was also provided a wonderful workspace. Despite being located so close to Downtown Chicago, the rooms were also quite quiet, I had no problems getting to sleep at night.\n\nEverything about my stay was very enjoyable. From the staff to the rooms, from the fitness center to the great bar, there wasn't a single thing for me to complain about.

So relaxing!", "I had a chance to stay at this hotel for about 3-4 days around September of last year during a business trip, and am happy enough with my experience that I'm planning to book a stay here again on my next business trip to Chicago. The rooms were nice, cozy and clean without too much frills, the views were excellent (it's possible that I lucked out on this, as I my room had a full view of the city), and had all the usual amenities like wi-fi, etc. What actually impressed me, though, was the amenities provided for outside of the room. The fitness room and swimming pools were available around the clock and not too crowded when I went there. We also had a business meeting at the hotel's meeting room which was very well organized and professional. Finally, the food and wine bar was excellent, with good food / drinks and stylish decor. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel if you're in the area on a business (or personal) trip.", "My husband and I stayed here at the Palomar for a short weekend getaway and we had such a blast! The hotel was VERY clean and the staff was super friendly. The lounge area was very fashionable and very pleasing to the eye. We had no problems checking in or getting to our room. I was quite surprised to see that they had supplied a yoga mat, free of charge, to our room. Being a yoga fanatic I was very pleased. I also had realized that we had both forgotten our toothbrushes. I mentioned this to the front receptionist and the hotel supplied them free of charge. The staff made us feel welcome and we really enjoyed a weekend of relaxation.

The environment surrounding the hotel was definitely lively, and shined a bright light on the hotel before even arriving inside. When walking inside, I was welcomed to the heartwarming atmosphere that was the living room. The light came through the many windows that surrounded it, and it definitely felt inviting. When given my room, I noticed the warm atmosphere that definitely contrasted from the liveliness of the outside. The serenity brought from the simple, yet elegant rooms definitely warmed up to me. I didn't use the In-Room Spa services, but from what others in the hotel were saying, it must have been quite the treat. I went to the indoor pool, which was kept clean at all times, and I definitely had a good time. Overall, this was a wonderful hotel, and I definitely recommend it to anybody staying in the area.", "staff was extremely friendly, informative and attentive. the waitstaff in the restaurant was the best! when our party kept complimenting the chef, the hostess had him come out of the kitchen to talk to us. he was the nicest person ever!", "I visited the Kimpton Hotel in Palomar Chicago on a business trip and I most say I was very happy with my stay.

As for the room, it was very clean and seemed like new construction!", "This hotel has a modern day speakeasy if you dont know what that is its an old school bar that was once a underground club when they outlawed alcohol. The place was very realistic and seemed like a nice little quaint place to settle down after a long day of work. On the other Hand the staff in other parts of the hotel were rude and showed a lack of care. My room took longer to get ready when i got there and they said they were sorry but did nothing to prove it making me wait after a long business meeting and i just wanted to relax especially after flying in from California earlier that day.", "My husband and I checked into the Palomar Chicago and although we were late for our reservation, they were extremely helpful and accommodating. The hotel was beautiful and our king-size bed was very comfortable. We had no problem settling into our room after a long day. Our room had all of the amenities we were expecting and then some!

The Palomar is a Kimpton Hotel and is conveniently located near all the sights and activities that the made Chicago famous and makes a welcoming sanctuary after a busy day of sight-seeing, shopping or business meetings.  Unwind in the comfortable lobby or dine on New England lobster roll or a New York strip steak topped with a cocoa infused espresso butter sauce at hotel's restaurant, The Sable Bar and Lounge.  Met with friends over a weekend brunch featuring chicken and waffles or shrimp and grits, then take in a Sunday matinee at the nearby Goodman Theater.", "This hotel was amazing for my wedding! We chose this hotel because of the many extra commodities it had. We wanted to have the wedding reception in their event space, and spend the night in the hotel afterwards. My wife loved the in room spa treatment that she received, and I personally loved being able to workout in the weight room also. We loved having the bar available for our reception, and everyone had a lot of fun with that! \nThe rooms were excellent also. While we didn't choose to do it, we liked that the hotel was pet-friendly. We initially thought each room would look roughly the same, but were pleasantly surprised to find out that they each had a lot of different style associated with them. \nThe room we chose was the City View King Deluxe Room, and I must say that it was absolutely beautiful. The skyline view of the city took our breath away, and made for an amazing wedding night with the love of my life. \nFinally, we must look at the service provided by the hotel staff. The front desk workers were very professional in their job and had a genuine smile that made us believe they actually enjoyed their job there. The various staff that worked the bar, reception, and cleaning areas were also very professional, very kind, and always helpful.\nI would recommend this hotel to anyone I know, it is a beautiful, well run hotel.", "A few months ago I traveled out to Chicago for a business conference and stayed here. I had never heard of the hotel but was happily surprised by the accommodations! The room was excellent, they had a fitness center in-house as well. Everywhere I needed to go was easily accessible, which is probably why the company chose it. I loved it though, would definitely stay here again.\n A note on the maids though - use the Do Not Disturb sign, or they WILL come knocking.", "Wow! I am really impressed with Palomar Chicago. It was clean, comfortable and the staff was so courteous.  The rooms feel like you are in an elegant home rather than a hotel.  I enjoyed the wine hour and the indoor pool at the hotel.

Great for weddings and you can also stay in shape with a pool and fitness area.  Also a spa is on location.  Come out to he Palomar there's no better place to stay.", "This hotel was great! Being at the Palomar Chicago, which is a Kimpton Hotel was very nice. It was clean, had fresh sheets, and towels were already ready in my shower!

I really felt right at home. \n\nWould recommend highly!", "This hotel is fantastic. It is located in downtown Chicago with great chic rooms. They look fantastic with very comfortable bedding. I enjoyed staying here with all the spa services that were offered. My little husky Kayla did too. She enjoyed being treated like a queen for the entire stay. It was great they let me use a leash to walk Kayla. I forgot mine at home as we don't have a leash law. My room itself was perfect, I could't even tell if a pet had stayed in this room before. Very clean and the customer service when checking in was top notch. Thank you for a great stay I will return again", "My family stayed at this hotel last summer and loved it! The location can't be beat -- River North is definitely the place to be if you want to get some shopping done given its proximity to the Miracle Mile, and it's extremely easy to get to the rest of Chicago via train.  The front desk staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the surrounding area, and we even got a free room upgrade since the one we booked wasn't ready when we arrived.  The room was clean, comfortable, and featured a huge 50\" television with all the premium cable channels. The attached restaurant, the Sable Kitchen & Bar, was superb as well.  If you're staying at Palomar you really owe it to yourself to have dinner here at least once, or at least stop by for their excellent happy hour!  All in all, the Palomar Chicago made our trip an unforgettable one.", "My stay here was very pleasant. I was able to rest very well thanks to a very comfortable mattress, and very little noise in the hall. The maid service was great, and they even left little chocolate mints!  They already had travel size soap, shampoo, and other necessities out for my use. I forgot my toothbrush, and one call to the desk resulted in one sent to my room in record time. Definately will stay again!", "I truly enjoyed my stay at the Palomar hotel, in Chicago. Of the Kimpton brand, the Palomar was perfect for my trip. An attentive staff paid attention to my every need. The room in the hotel was spacious and my stay could not have been better.", "I came to this hotel for a business conference held in several of their many business meeting rooms.  The hotel offered free Wi-Fi and the main meeting room had a beautiful crystal chandelier hanging from the center - the place looked like a ballroom in an old palace.  The conference was catered by the hotel as well and the food was top-notch, the service excellent.  As for my room, the accommodations were very nice and seemed to have all the amenities of a much more expensive hotel at a fraction of the price (although we probably got a discount conference rate) and the indoor pool and fitness center were an amazing bonus to an already pleasant stay.  I didn't have a chance to take advantage of the in-room spa offer, but maybe on my next stay ... there will certainly be a next stay!", "My wife and I stayed for 2 nights at this hotel while in Chi-Town back in March 2013 because we stayed at The Hotel Palomar while in Los Angeles last year and loved it. \n\nThe check-in process was quick and the gentlemen checking us in, Ryan, was so friendly and you can tell geniunely loves his job. The rooms here were gorgeous, clean and so welcoming.\n\nAfter a day of sight seeing, my wife and I were so sore and a swim in the indoor heated pool they havhere was amazing. We felt so good after our hour swim.\n\nNow on to dinner...once we found out that Heather Terhune was the chef at Sable Kitchen And Bar at the hotel, we were there. My wife had a steak and I had the fish and both dishes were AMAZING!! The place has an amazing fireplace and as beautiful.\n\nSo after staying for 2 days we definately didnt want to leave, but had to. I can't say enought positive things about Hotel Palomar, so next time we visit Chicago, we will definately stay here.", "What can I say about the Palomar that hasn't already been said!!! I love this place! I travel to Chicago often and am a big fan of the Kimpton brand so of course I'm going to stay there! It definitely lived up to the standard of Kimpton Service that I am used to receiving when I stay in one. This place is unique as well. The location could not be better right in \"the loop\" in downtown and having an indoor pool on those cold Chicago days was a real treat. I'm a self proclaimed yogi so imagine my thrill when a yoga mat was provided for me in the room. Says \"Kimpton\" all over it. I was a little early for check-in which is not a problem at this hotel as I was right on time for wine hour, a must experience in any Kimpton hotel. This hotel honestly could not have been better, believe me when I say \"I'll be BACK!!!\".", "My girlfriend and I were invited to a friends wedding in Chicago, and we decided to treat ourselves and stay at the Palomar. The hotel was pricey, but we found a decent deal online. Everything was fantastic. The hotel is modern and has a great atmosphere.

There was a great bar downstairs too, although we never managed to make it down there in time for their happy hour. If we end up coming back to Chicago, we're definitely coming back here!", "My family recently stayed at the Palomar Chicago hotel where a family member got married. Hands down it is probably the most beautiful hotel we've ever gotten a chance to stay at. We got it with a AAA discount and so the price was great. The hotel is at the heart of Chicago's River North, close to everything. When you first enter, the furniture and decor is so contemporary. We wouldn't have minded waiting in the main room but we got our room right away.  The people at front desk were very nice and friendly. As soon as we got into our room we were shocked at the size. We had a family suite with double beds. We also had a living room and full kitchen. Everything was modern looking and the decor was beautiful. It had everything we needed. My husband works out a lot so we were amazed to see how much equipment was in the fitness area. There were multiple treadmills, ellipticals, and a weight bench. We were happy that it was right next to the pool area, so the kids and I were near him as he worked out. There is also a very comfortable lounge area next to the pool with comfortable lounge chairs. Our friend had ordered the bridesmaids an in room spa treatment which was perfect so I didn't have to leave my kids to go anywhere. The room for the rehearsal dinner was beautiful too. The night of the wedding was spectacular. There was a lounge area which was perfect for the large size wedding my friend had. The main ballroom was beautiful. The view of Chicago from the ballroom was amazing. The food was delicious. There is a restaurant called Sable Kitchen & Bar which had great food at a decent price. The hotel itself if superb. It is so clean and well maintained. The decor is exquisite. My friend made a great decision to get married here. Next time we go to Chicago, we are definitely staying here again.", "What style and class this hotel had.  I had an exceptional stay at the Hotel Palomar.  The customer service was outstanding and everyone was very friendly.  The rooms were top of the line and very home-like.  The maids also did a very good job of cleaning up the rooms in our absence.  I also very much enjoyed the bar in the lobby, it was very classy and I met a bunch of cool people during my stay! Thank you very much for such a pleasurable stay!\n\nAll the best!!\n\nTJN", "I went to Palomar Chicago expecting great service, and I can definitely say I got what I wanted. I stayed for three nights, and enjoyed the gym, pool, and room service. They have a decent selection of machines, but what was really great was the pool. It was a great temp, and relaxing to swim in. The room service was actually better than average, and my room was as tidy as I keep mine at home (so very tidy). I went to the bar on my last night too, and I thought it was worthwhile. Great hotel, 4/5.", "My wife and I recently visited some friends in Chicago, and had a very nice stay at the Palomar.  The staff were very polite and helpful, our room was spotless, and we felt very well taken care of.  We are both very into fitness and taking care of ourselves, and we were very pleased with the fitness center.  All the equipment was modern and well maintained.\n\nWe stayed for three nights and would happily stay here again next time we find ourselves in the city.", "I recently stayed at the Palomar Chicago in Downtown Chicago. I have nearly always stayed at another hotel while downtown previously. I'll definitely stay here again. The staff was excellent, very helpful and courteous, and the rooms were very nice. They were somewhat larger than the rooms at the other hotel I have patronized and completely up to date. The bar and restaurant were quite good too. Although I was on business I think it would be a good choice for a family trip to downtown Chicago.", "The staff is great they really do their best to make you feel welcome! The room is absolutely beautiful, clean and very organized with modern furniture. \nTo relax even more, I recommend getting one of those In-Room Spa Features they offer, I did a massage treatment that was the best one I had by far.\n\nOverall is a great hotel, amazing location close to a lot of shopping centers and museums. I will definitely come back!", "I recently made a trip out to Chicago and stayed in the W, more specifically, the \"Spectacular\" room, which easily lived up to its name.  I loved the modern design of the room and the lighting was great (I really cannot stand fluorescent lighting).  The room itself was quite small, but it made up for that in quality.  I would much rather stay in a small, cozy, and clean room as opposed to a large room that smells of musty basement, like some other hotels I've experienced.  I was pleasantly surprised by the amenities offered, I even had a place to dock my iPhone and listen to some music.  The location is wonderful, but, honestly, I didn't make it out much; I spent much of the trip curled up in bed relaxing.  If you are looking for a relatively cheap place to stay that does not sacrifice quality and character, this is the hotel for you!  I will definitely be staying here during my next venture to the Windy City.", "This hotel is modern, sleek, and clean but best of all it is close to all of the fun things in Chicago! I always felt that the staff always worked efficiently to meet my needs and I was very pleased. The bar in the hotel is also very fun!", "My wife and I recently stayed at the W Chicago City Center hotel for the weekend while visiting Chicago and we had a blast. Firstly, the rooms of the hotel are aesthetically incredible by themselves. Just walking into the hotel to see its beauty was breath-taking enough. The lighting, artwork, and architecture were all pleasing to the senses. Checking in only took a couple of minutes, one of the fastest check-in times I've ever had. The prices of the rooms were great as well! The location of the hotel is PERFECT for those who wish to do some shopping as it is right next to a large amount of stores and seemed to be in the center of everything. The valet service was great and when my wife asked for extra towels they were delivered to our room in less than three minutes. The room we had was incredibly clean and the bed was super comfortable which gave us the chance to have an amazing nights sleep both nights. The bathrooms were more spacious in comparison to what we were used too and the shampoo and conditioner they came with were great as well. There was also a really great looking fitness center, thought we were too busy looking around Chicago to check it out further. Overall, I give this hotel a 5 out of 5 and my wife and I will be sure to visit again! Oh, and don't tell my wife, but the bar was amazing.", "The W in Chicago is hands down the best hotel I've stayed at in years. It's so trendy and modern and clean, you can't help but be excited about what Chicago holds in store for your trip. The in-room spa service was amazing and I loved that I could bring our pets with us with no extra charges. The bed was extremely comfortable, which is always a plus when far from home, not to mention the exceptionally friendly staff that went above and beyond in their levels of customer service. I would definitely stay here again!", "My husband decided to surprise me with a getaway weekend for our tenth anniversary. He surprised me with a two hour limo drive to the W Chicago City Center Hotel. It was beautiful, and I was so excited just seeing it when we pulled up. My husband was so excited to show me around Chicago, but we ended up not leaving the hotel.  We ate the finest food in the most spectacular hotel room I have ever been in.  Their Whatever/Whenever concierge service was amazing, and is just what it sounds like.  The staff was terrific, and all too willing to accommodate us.  I slept in the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in, and we have made a plan to come back here every year for our Anniversary.  If you are going to Chicago for one night or a week, I would highly recommend the W Chicago City Center.", "The W Chicago- City Center hotel is one of the best hotels in the entire city.

The name couldn't be more fitting, it is positioned right in the center of Chicago.  The view was breathtaking from the room.  We could see the Chicago Institute of Art and everything.  We found it really conveniently located around a lot of museums, parks, and shops.  We went to this one park that had a really amazing fountain, and it's really close to the hotel.  A great place to stay and take pictures.  The architecture in this hotel is exquisite.  From the marble topped bar counters, tall ceilings, and perfectly positioned dining areas I felt like I was a king.  I will definitely be coming back to Chicago,and staying at the W Chicago.", "I visited W Chicago - City Center hotel when I was on vacation in Chicago. Immediately when I showed up I was greeted by the lovely front desk worker. She was very kind and helpful. In fact, every service member that worked their was extremely nice and friendly. When we got to our room it was a 2 queen sized bed room and the matresses were one of the most comfortable matresses I have ever been on in a hotel. The quality of all the furniture in the room was superb. We had a room with a fantastic view of the hotels pool with an overview of a nice part of the city. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel to stay in while in Chicago. We never encountered any problems while we were staying there. But even if we did I'm sure the customer service would have been grateful to help us. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Chicago.", "My wife and I are big White Sox fans, and we recently took a trip to Chicago to catch a series. We were looking for a comfortable hotel that's centrally located. The W City Center was immediately a front runner. We loved the location and the photos enticed us. Cost was in line with what we expected. The clincher for us, though, was the PAW program. Most hotels disdain dogs. The W not only accepts pets but pampers them with their own beds and treats.\n\nWhen we arrived, we found the hotel even more alluring than the photographs we had seen. The architecture and furnishings are top-notch and made us feel at home. We checked in for our 3 night stay quickly and made our way to the room. We walked in to a luxurious setting and started to unwind from our travels. The concierge recommended a local Thai restaurant where we had a delightful dinner before heading to the first game.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed having a restful place to return after enjoying the attractions of Chicago. The W elevated our entire trip experience. Oh, and the Sox won the series! I would highly recommend the City Center W to anyone.", "The W Chicago-City Center provides the highest level of quality and elegance for your stay.

With all the services included in the price for the accommodation, our vacancy became extremely pleasurable. We had breakfast and lunch at the hotel's restaurant, which offered some interesting meals for our tastes. But it was amazing.\nWe could visit any place we wanted, as the hotel was perfectly placed near some of the most important places in the city.\nIn the end, choosing W Chicago - City Center was the best decision and I really hope that I'll be able to repeat this experience some day.", "I spent last weekend at the W Chicago City Center while I was in Chicago and absolutely loved it. Everything from the art in the lobby to the furniture in the rooms just screamed sophistication. \n\nMy reservation was for their \"Fabulous\" room, and I can tell you this. It stood up to its name. The TV was huge, the desk was big enough to work on, and they even supply an IPod dock so that I could play my music and charge easily.\n\nIn addition to all the wonderful rooms, the hotel's location made it really easy to get to site-seeing locations in Chicago. The Art Institute of Chicago was less than a mile away. There was a shopping mall about a half mile away. And Soldier Field was even in walking distance (it's a little far, but walkable and probably better than trying to drive there on game day). \n\nAll in all, I loved this hotel. 10/10, would stay at again.", "My stay at the W Chicago - City Center was wonderful. Located in the heart of Chicago, the hotel was a short walk from all of Chicago's main attractions, including restaurants and shopping.

Since it was my first time being in Chicago for a business meeting. They were very helpful in telling me how to find my way around the area. The hotel is in the heart of entertainment, such as several performing arts theaters, restaurants, and shopping centers. What I really loved, was the fact the hotel had a 24/7 fitness center. I've been to many hotels which have fitness centers but only stay open latest 7-10pm. I like going late at night with less clutter. The room I chose to go with was the \"Wonderful Room\". These rooms do look alot nicer and more up to date than other hotels Ive been to. Very spacious, especially if your by yourself. Above everything was the view I was on the 11th floor. The view was out of this world, well at least for me. I love watching skylines at night. I would definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone whether it be for business or pleasure. Rating for me: 4.5/5", "My husband and I stayed at the W Chicago last weekend for a brief getaway.  We wanted a room that was well-appointed, in a hotel that was close to everything Chicago has to offer.  This hotel did not disappoint!  The lobby was great - very trendy and comfortable.  Both desk clerks we interacted with were friendly and helpful.  And the room - fantastic!  It was very clean, stylish but not obnoxious, with a super comfy bed.  It was great to return to it each night and settle in after a long day of sightseeing and shopping!  We'll definitely be staying at the W on our next trip to Chicago.", "Overall a great experience had here!\nThe staff was extremely helpful, polite, and attentive to all of my needs. The room was very clean and was tidied up every day without exception.

It's central location offers guests the opportunity to be close to many local attractions, including the Chicago Art Institute Museum and Millennium Park. Once we arrived at the W Chicago - City Center hotel, we  were very impressed with their upscale decor and fast service. The staff was friendly and ready to help. A bell hop helped us to our room, which was clean and elegantly decorated. After we were settled, we headed down to the hotel lobby to ask for recommendations for dinner. A very friendly concierge pointed us in the direction of the hotel's Living Room Bar. The food was great, the atmosphere was lively and we really enjoyed our stay at the W Chicago - City Center hotel. We cannot wait to return when we visit Chicago again.", "I came into the Chicago area last week and was looking for a nice hotel to stay at. I was pointed in the direction of the W City Center. I went there and was impressed with the outside of the building before I ever went inside. This being my first time in the windy city I wanted to get a good hotel and have a good nights sleep before setting off for the sites and sounds of the city the next day. I walked into the hotel reception area and was very pleased by the layout of the area and friendly staff. As I had an open account with the company that I worked for and an option for whatever room I wanted I opted for the Wow suite, and believe me I was wowed alright. I was struck by how the room was set up and the fantastic space of the room. The colors of the room were crisp and clean, as were the lines and shapes of the furniture. A living room and dining room fit for a king. I could not wait to get into the spa tub and relax from my flight. It was fantastic and the terry robe provided the right mix for some tv, which I was also impressed with. A \"42\" inch plasma gave it that theater feel. I made a drink from the inside bar and had some munchies. I knew that my guest would also enjoy and love the room and all its features. It was gonna be very good vacation in W Chicago-City Center", "very elegant hotel; gives it a romantic setting. from the pictures i would give it 5 stars", "Beautiful. Extremely upscale feel.

We stayed at the W Hotel in Chicago at City Center and were overjoyed with our choice. Our beautiful suite was clean, comfortable, and very spacious for the price. We were even able to bring our pets with us! The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating to our entire family, and really made us feel welcomed. They provided us with information about the city and recommendations for daytime activities, along with family friendly restaurants for dinner. They even have a \"whatever/whenever\" service to help with purchasing tickets and making reservations! We had such a great experience that we're now planning a return trip. We have certainly found our hotel of choice in Chicago from now on!", "Coming to Chicago has become the highlight of my work year, and it certainly isn't because I love my job. The real joy is staying at the W Chicago. During my first stay their I was sure I was in for a miserable time, meeting with other, putting my dog in a kennel back home, meetings 12+ hours three days in a row, my aversion to filthy cabs, and living off of takeout food for 3 days straight. The W Chicago negated every aspect of travel that I had previously  disdained. One of my coworkers informed me that I pets were welcome, so I was relieved, bringing Rufus with me avoids a lot of anxiety and extra planning, not to mention paying for a kennel. \nThe rooms themselves, were IMMACULATE, stylish, modern, but not overly so, and large, the sort of quality I would expect to see only in a high rollers suite in Las Vegas or some other such place. The hotel, actually offered dog foods, and dog walking, even doggie turndown service! They also offered a complimentary luxury SUV and driver, so I gladly avoided the disgust of taking a cab back and forth, (reserve the SUV service well in advance as it is very popular). After my meeting everyday, I came home,yes it is a true home away from home for people like me, and after my meetings, I would pet Rufus, and hop into my personal spa, afterwords, getting a world class massage. However, what truly sets this apart from everywhere else I have stayed, they offer the whatever, whenever service. I personally took full advantage of this, having them pick up my dinner every night from different restaurants. This is the type of service, that again would only be seen in Las Vegas for the biggest gamblers. My company makes the choice to stay at the W Chicago year after year, and we have never been less than astounded at their excellence.", "I stayed at the W Chicago for a few days when I was in town for a conference, and I was blown away by the level of customer service I received from the entire staff. My room was impeccably clean and the people behind the desk were very helpful when I had questions about where to get dinner. I also ate at the hotel restaurant- amazing short ribs! I loved the modern style of my room, definitely didn't feel like your standard boring hotel decor. Will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.", "W Chicago City Center Hotel is fantastic. I loved every minute of my weekend stay in this hotel. The valet parking rate and service are great. The moment you enter the lobby you know you are in the most comfortable hospitable place imaginable. The wait or my room keys at the front desk was only 2 or 3 minutes. The rooms are so clean! I am a very picky person and I can't say enough how impeccable everything looks in the rooms. The house cleaners were so friendly and knowledgeable. Breakfast was served hot and fresh. Everything I need is here inside the hotel. It has a fitness center that i used as I exercise everyday. Pets are welcomed. My stay was so delightful that I even forgot about all my financial problems. I can assure you that I will be coming back very soon!", "I cannot imagine having a better experience at a hotel than the one I just had at W Hotel in Chicago City Center. First of all, I was immediately greeted by friendly personnel when I stepped inside the beautiful front doors. My check in process went smoothly, and the bellhop quickly attended to my bags and helped me to my room. The room itself was immaculate. The level of sophistication in design was great and I can assure you that anyone staying here will more than get their money's worth. The location was also great. Being in City Center meant I had easy access to cabs and public transit. I look forward to coming back to Chicago so I can stay at W City Center again.", "Here are my thoughts about the W Chicago City Center Hotel. The facade of the building is striking, especially when paired with the beautiful Chicago skyline. The hotel is very close to several areas of tourism interest in the city such as State Street, the Sear's Tower and Millennium Park to name a few. The lobby is huge and ornately appointed as you would expect the iconic hotels of yesteryear to be. The W also features meeting rooms, a business center, very nicely equipped gym and my personal favorite, the \"Living Room Bar\". The bar serves up all of you favorite adult concoctions at reasonable prices. The guest rooms were very clean, sleek and modern with a  sort of art-deco twist, which, is usually not my style but I made an exception with this hotel as it was decorated tastefully. Being a pet owner I also loved the PAW or pets are welcome service that allowed me to bring along my extended family as well. All in all, it was a wonderful hotel in an even more wonderful city and I would highly recommend this place for your next visit!", "I just love this hotel! It has an amazing living room style bar with the most relaxing environment. Not to mention all of the great restaurants that are right in the area. I am looking forward to my next stay here!", "W Chicago City Center has the most beautiful setting for all kinds of get-a-ways. It's chic, and has the most up-to-date style. Service is friendly and willing to make your stay unforgettable. It's close to the theater and shopping centers for fun shopping and great entertainment. The most amazing food served from the Executive Chef Trevor Hoyte's New Urban Cuisine at IPO Restaurant Chicago or delight in a sip under the vaulted ceilings of the Chicago Hotel Bar. This is my number one choice for staying in Chicago. I would not go anywhere else.", "The W Chicago - City Center hotel is an outstanding site for whatever kind of stay you need while you are in Chicago. Be it business, pleasure, or a special occasion, the hotel will meet all of your needs. \n\nThe hotel is steps from the bustle of downtown Chicago.

We stayed in the Fabulous Room style and everything was very clean and modern looking. The beds were very cozy and it was nice and quiet in our room. The best part though was the location, we were right in the middle of the city and were able to see all the great sites. Overall I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Downtown Chicago.", "The sky's the limit\n\nThe W Chicago stature is breathe taking. As soon as you walk in the hotel your eyes are all over the place. You are greeted by employees and fine art. The costumer service was great, and the food wasn't bad. if you like to drink they have a full bar that's open all night. the rooms were very nice and spacious with an awesome view. overall great hotel!!", "We stayed here at the W Chicago last weekend.  We had tickets to a show downtown, and decided to stay for the weekend and explore the city.  This is a GREAT hotel.\nIt had everything we were looking for-\nPerfect location!  We were just a few minutes walk away from some of Chicago's best restaurants.  And while I took a few minutes for handling some work problems, my wife loved the  shopping close by.\n\nGreat staff.  They staff were universally friendly.  The concierge was especially nice as he made several dinner reservations for us during our stay.  It was so nice having a \"local\" make recommendations and then to make the reservation to.  \n\nThe room itself was exquisite.  So nice we almost didn't want to leave the room.  The Super Comfy bed was perfect.\n\nAll in all, we plan to stay here if we ever get back to Chicago.", "My wife and I travel to a different city that has a pro baseball team once a year, to try to catch all the Major League stadiums. This year we chose Chicago to see the Cubs, and we chose to stay at the W Chicago. It was one of the best experiences we have ever had with a hotel. We look for more than just a comfortable bed, relaxing atmosphere and an iPod docking station. Those amenities now seem like requirements, instead of bells and whistles. What made our stay at W memorable was the friendliness and service of everyone from the front desk, room service, concierge and bell hops. We carry singles on us just in case something comes up and need to tip, and everyone refused. They must pay their people well, and that is a great way to retain good quality employees. They made great suggestions for food, gave us a spot-on route to get to Wrigley Field in a timely manner, and had the quickest response I had ever seen when requesting fresh towels. My wife and I will be recommending the W to all our friends, and won't even be shopping for hotels next time we come to the Windy City.", "After a long and tedious day of dealing with stressful flights and long delays that made me want to tear out my hair, I came to the W Chicago hoping to relax and unwind. And I was SO not disappointed. The staff that greeted me were friendly, polite, and so willing to offer me anything I might want. If I hadn't been so tired, I probably would have asked for more than peace and quiet.\n\nAnyway, checking in took mere moments, and then I was whisked away to the WOW suite where I was welcomed by a living room so cosy that it put my own to shame. Once I was alone, I kicked off my shoes, and took a long nap on the beautiful black plush couch. I have to say that nap was one of the most refreshing naps I've had in my life! I really wish I knew where W Chicago got their couches from so I could have one for myself!\n\nBut the couch was just the beginning, as I soon found out. Once I started to explore the rest of the rooms, I found myself at a loss for words. A dining room? One and a half bathrooms complete with a spa tub in the larger room, complete with a Bliss - which is such good soap you cannot believe it - six pack by the sink? A-MAZ-ING! And everything was so clean - not a spot of dirt or dust was to be found anywhere. I hope the maids get paid well for the job they do in keeping things so tidy!\n\nOnce I made my way back to the living room (after stopping into the bedroom and admiring the feel of those beautiful plush covers and downy-soft pillows on my king sized bed), I realized I'd completely ignored the humongous 42 inch plasma. Shame on me, cause it even had hookups for my laptop  (goodbye tiny laptop screen, hello awesome Screen of Bigness!) so I could get some work done while I relaxed.\n\nUnfortunately, being pampered had its drawbacks. By the time my weekend in Chicago was over, I didn't want to leave. I had been so spoiled by W Chicago's lush accommodations and lovely staff that I just didn't want to leave. \n\nThat said, if you're in the Chicago area anytime soon and you want to be as spoiled as I was, you would be well to come to the W Chicago, where your wish is their command.", "I recently found myself in the Chicago area for an annual business meeting and decided to try out a new hotel (given that my choice last time was pretty awful.)  I came across this hotel online and was immediately sold with their offerings of a 24 hour fitness center, wifi access and overall, the beauty of the rooms pictured on their website.\n\nI had a surprisingly good stay. Well above and beyond my expectations. I travel on business a lot and frequent hotels nearly weekly in various states, so when I say that this hotel is nice, it is definitely NICE!\n\nI chose the \"Marvelous Suite\" and while it was a little on the pricey side, the company is paying for it, so why not?  I am glad that I did and it was well worth the money spent.  The room was immaculate and practically everything brand new.  I walked in and was greeted by a flat screen tv, very spacious work desk with hookups for everything I brought with me and a nice living area with a couple of couches to relax on after a hard days work.  Nice plush carpeting which was so very nice to walk on in my bare feet and the bathroom complete with everything, from lotion, to hairdryer, plenty of plush towels and virtually everything I needed for my short stay there.\n\nOverall just a wonderful experience and on my next trip this way, I will definitely be returning!", "Chicago City Center meets all the needs of both old and young alike. With plenty of activities to do such as putt putt golf in one of many local meeting areas. You can also sign up to have your own meeting with others of like minds such as flower   decor to photo shopping in the meeting rooms. The sleeping quarters are just as fabulous as you would like with candle fragrances of your choosing to the color coordinated sheets/ towels coloring.

Decorated in a very contemporary style with lots of amenities.  The staff was polite and helpful. I enjoyed using their gym, it was better equipped then most hotel gyms are. I lift weights and very few gyms have free weights available. It was especially nice that I was able to bring my dog.  They even included a turn down treat for him on his doggy bed.  All in all it was a wonderful experience and I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Chicago.", "The hotel's location is very convenient being close to many notable sites in New York.

I had a great experience and would defiantly go again!", "I decided to stay at this hotel for two nights, a Friday and Saturday. I arrive and am greeted by a clean atmosphere and friendly staff. I get checked in in under 5 minutes, and get happily on my way to my room. Wow, the room is nice! Everything is spotless, the bed is perfect and soft and the pillows rest my rather large head nicely. The food in the morning was great, as goes for the dinner and lunch meals! The only thing I found wrong is that it was hard to find staff members to assist me, and closet spaces were a bit too small to fit all of my stuff. Also, it wasn't too quiet at the hotel.", "New York's Hotel Pennsylvania is a smart idea for any parent, couple or professional: free wi-fi offered, discounts for long visits, and packages and special offers to fit your every need.

It was my first trip to New York and I was a little nervous about going alone. My manager booked a room for me at the Hotel Pennsylvania, located on 7th Avenue, and I was so pleased with the place. My room was great. I had a room with a comfy double bed, chair and a work space so that I could write up summary reports of the meetings I had to attend. Though wi-fi wasn't available in my room, it was available in the lobby and in the hotel's business center, so I had no trouble checking my email. \n\nHotel Pennsylvania is in a wonderful location as well. It's convenient to great shops, Broadway and all the best Manhattan has to offer. I wish my schedule had allowed more time for sightseeing, but at least I was able to take a day and see the some of the city and do some shopping.\n\nBut the staff is what made this hotel really special.

For the price of the $200 per night package, we got the $260 instead, which included free tickets to go see the Empire State Building, which neither of us had ever seen before!\n\nThe maids did an amazing job cleaning every day, and not once did we notice them other than the room looking great and fresh when we got back. Every employee we encountered during our stay acted truly professional towards us, and like our comfort and enjoyment was their only focus.\n\nI wish we could have stayed longer! This is definitely going to be our go-to hotel for staying in New York from now on. Five stars!", "The hotel is located in beautiful New York. It seems to portray a classic business-like look to the outside, but once you step in you are swept off your feet by the beauty of the lobby. Marble floors and pillars are everywhere, including leather couches as well. This hotel also has a state of the art work out facility for people who need to relieve some stress. Every room is accompanied by a marvelous view of New York.", "I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania overnight for a business trip. I booked a superior double bed and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the room.  The furnishings surpassed my expectations. Everything was scrupulously clean and well appointed with quality linens and plenty of plush towels. While there I used the fitness center and was impressed with the number and variety of the cardio machines.  I also used the computers provided in the Penn 500 lounge to check email with the gratis internet. The complimentary breakfast was handy and kept me from running late to my meeting. I plan on staying again the next time business takes me to the city.", "\"Good value\"\n\nThe hotel had everything I was looking for- great location, clean room, access to fitness equipment, and free wi-fi- all at a great price!  Walking distance from restaurants and shopping, friendly staff.  Basic accomodations, but I would definitely stay here again.", "During my recent stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York I was immediately impressed with the hotel's atmosphere. The minute I stepped into the lobby, I felt like I was a member of a high class society. The location of the hotel was also a big factor in determining whether to stay; there are a lot of different places to go from its convenient location just a block away from the Empire State Building. Everything about the hotel felt classy--from the room, to the elevators, and everything in between. Even the complimentary breakfast was of high quality with a lot of great choices, especially considering my experience with other hotels in the past. The staff members were all courteous and professional, as well. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and I highly recommend the Hotel Pennsylvania to anyone looking to have a great time in the greatest city in the world: New York City.", "The location of the hotel is what really makes it stand out.  The hotel is directly across the street from Madison Square Garden!  The price for this place was actually a bit less than what I was planning to spend.  We received continental breakfast with our stay which saved us a lot of money.  The hotel had one of those make-your-own waffle makers which are my all time favorite!  They often run great deals for this place so it is affordable.  Our room had HBO which was a great bonus, not that we were spending too much time in our hotel room, but it was a plus for sure.  The staff was great and very helpful when I asked them for directions to the conference I was attending.  all in all I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay again.", "Stayed in this hotel for two nights a few months ago. The location is probably the most attractive aspect, as it was fairly close to downtown. I stayed in a single bedroom during my stay, and I found that it included everything I needed. Although they do charge extra for wifi, I got it for free by booking online. Hotel Penn has pretty much everything you look for in a hotel, including a tv, gym, pool, and breakfast packages. The interior of this hotel is very nice. This place had marbled walls everywhere and was beautifully furnished. Overall, I would definitely recommend Hotel Pennsylvania, it's absolutely worth it.", "My stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania New York was incredible.  The staff and amazing and very helpful for our needs.  Travelling is always a stressful time, but even with my family's forgotten items and stress potential, they were very accommodating.  The location near to Macy's and the Empire State building were exceptional especially since we were there for the Thanksgiving parade.  We were able to enjoy our time, enjoy our stay and feel safe in heart of Manhattan.   I would recommend this to any of my friends and family in a heartbeat.", "This is a very glamorous hotel - one of the best I've ever stayed in. The hotel lobby was large and spacious and the room was comfortable. The staff helped with everything I asked for and were genuinely interested in making sure my stay was great. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll make sure that I see if the Hotel Pennsylavania is open", "I stayed at Hotel Pennsylvania in New York 2 summers ago and it was without a doubt one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The price was hefty but it was well worth it. The hotel is in a great location and came with many amenities such as a full-fledged gym and high speed internet. The rooms were very pristine and well-stocked. Our window had an excellent view of New York City. \n\nService was great. My wife and I arrived back at the hotel late at night and we needed extra sheets and pillows and so we phoned up customer service and they immediately brought them. \n\nOverall it was a very pleasant experience and its location is definitely worth the price tag.", "My husband and I just made our first trip to New York - and what a trip it was! We are both originally from Montana and neither of us have been east of the Mississippi before so we felt completely out of our element when we started planning our trip. Fortunately, one of our better traveled friends suggested we check out Hotel Pennsylvania! \nThe hotel was right next door to the Empire State Building and walking distance to the theater district. We couldn't have asked for a better location. The hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, making fabulous dining suggestions and helping us secure theater tickets at the last minute. \nThe lobby of the Hotel Pennsylvania is gorgeous. I felt like we'd stepped back in time. Our rooms were quiet and comfortable, and better yet, affordable. I would absolutely stay there again - now that I know first hand how exciting and amazing New York City is, I can't wait to return!", "What was not great about this hotel? I loved every minute I was there.\n\nThe food they serve there is great, they have great employees, even the rooms were superb!\n\nThe whole entire hotel was very spotless and clean. The pool and gym at the hotel were very nice and I enjoyed using them.\n\nGetting a reservation at the hotel couldn't be any simpler as well. The location of the hotel is unbelievable aswell, very close to stores and such.\n\nThe inside of the hotel once you walk in is very nice and I never wanted to leave! I can't wait until the next time I go there.", "At first i was skeptical about this hotel because I have never heard of it before but was recommended about it by a friend. The registry was nice and helpful. When I got to my room, I opened it and it smelled fresh. I got a nice view from my window much better than that time I was at circus circus and received a room with horrible view. The bed was neat, I checked the sheets because I had a bad experience with dirty bed sheets before. It was clean. This hotel isn't like one of the usual looking hotels, it has a kind of unique homely feel to it, even though it's not quite the size of a home. The bathroom was nice standard clean toilet clean sink and bathtub. Overall I would give this hotel a 8 out of 10.", "Hotel Pennsylvania in New York is a beautiful hotel that is open and has wonderful customer service.\n Their accommodations are truly amazing, especially for my eight person family! The employee's are helpful and knowledgeable about concerns you may or may not have.\n One thing they had that many other hotels didn't is household necessities. My daughter constantly to bring her hairdryer on family vacation, and sure enough she did it again! The only difference was the hotel had provided one, and trust me that saved hours of bickering and whining coming from my daughter. \n I slept like a baby for the first time in years! Usually, I wake up and either my back or neck hurts like crazy, but not this time. I was amazed and honestly surprised, since even the softest mattresses cause some discomfort. \n If someone asked if I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family then I would indeed say that I would. I give this hotel a five star!", "I recently stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania and enjoyed it immensely.  The staff were very friendly.  The Hotel Pennsylvania has different rooms available depending on the size of your family.  I couldn't find a single staff member that wasn't happy to see us; from the valet to the front desk, everyone greeted us with a smile and was more than happy to assist us with anything we needed.  The rooms were spacious with a mini-fridge, flat-screen TV, and high-speed internet (at a cost!).  There was also a convenient restaurant located in the lobby if you wanted to get some food on a rainy day, and the business center has a printer should you need to print off directions or reservation confirmations. The cost is definitely reasonable for what you get, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice hotel in New York!", "My family and I stayed at the Hotel Pennsylvania during our trip to New York, and we couldn't have been happier! We arrived in the dead of night, exhausted and hungry - and got exactly what we needed with a quick meal at Lindy's 24-hour restaurant. The high-speed internet in the lobby helped us plan our day, and the accommodating staff even helped us set up a baby crib for our littlest one! \n\nBut the hotel's greatest feature, by far, was its location. In the course of a day, we not only made it to Macy's and Times Square, we were able to take a peek at Madison Square Garden and to visit the top of the Empire State Building itself! And when we found the time to take in a show on Broadway, that was within walking distance, too! We almost went the entire week without hailing a cab!\n\nThanks to the Penn, we were able to do everything we had planned and more. If you're visiting New York and want to get the whole experience, I can't recommend the Penn enough!", "Although Hotel Pennsylvania would seem like a hotel found in a woodsy area of Pennsylvania, it is in fact located in the heart of New York City. Besides the perfect location, located a block away from any necessity (a few more for any restaurants or sight seeing locations), the hotel is quite wonderful itself. First seeing the beautiful building and being greeted outside by staff who will help you with luggage, (as well as flag down a taxi if needed), the start of your stay is made comfortably. The lobby is large, clean and beautiful and the check in was a breeze. All the staff was helpful and friendly, from check in to check out. Staying in their Penn 5000 room was a great experience. The room was lovely and the service was amazing (delicious room service and great housekeeping). Having accepted the breakfast package, the morning of our check out, we had dined in the hotel. Not much to our surprise, it was just like every other amenity in the hotel; wonderful! I would definitely visit this hotel again and recommend to all my friends and family.", "The Hotel Pennsylvania was a great hotel to stay at with great food, amazing staff, and a lovely place to stay for a long weekend. It was an amazing price to stay here, and it was right next to all the main attractions. The breakfast package was a great added bonus, I loved the waffles. The staff was so kind and the room service was amazing. I would recommend this hotel for anyone that wants to enjoy the sights and sounds of New York, and return to a room that feels just like home. So next time you are in New York, stop by The Hotel Pennsylvania, because I know I sure will.", "New York's Hotel Pennsylvania is one of the best hotel's I've stayed in. This is the only hotel, as far as I'm concerned, where the longer I stayed the more I'd saved. The rise & shine breakfast was one of my favorite presents from the hotel. The package that I got when visiting and staying at this hotel included receiving coupons to some of New York's stores. Being the coupon guru that I am, this came as a very satisfactory gift for me. The WiFi is absolutely free and the internet connection is excellent! With my accommodation, I also received a free pass to bally total fitness, which was also super amazing! Moreover, the location is excellent because it is right in Midtown, so all of the touristy attractions are very openly accessible to you. Walking out of your hotel and onto the streets of new York, you feel very safe. Especially for someone used to a very quiet suburban environment. If ever I am in New York again, Hotel Penn will definitely be my hotel of choice. I'd recommend anyone visiting New York or looking to stay somewhere to getaway to come to Hotel Penn.", "My wife and I stayed here for two nights on vacation and I highly recommend it. For the price, you can't get a cleaner hotel room with friendlier service. Breakfast was good and on time and the Wifi working is a nice change from other hotels.", "Want to get the most out of your trip to New York? Want to relax luxuriously and comfortably after a day of sight seeing and entertainment? Then Hotel Pennsylvania New York is for you. I have stayed in hotels all over the country from motels on the side of the highway to high end suites 200 stories above ground, and I have to say that Hotel Pennsylvania is definitely one of my favorites. The staff made me feel more like an old friend than a customer, and met my every need with a smile on their face. The room was beautiful with an amazing view, and all the amenities that you could ask for. The price was also very reasonable for the quality of the hotel. I couldn't ask for a better place to stay during my vacation. It made the entire trip that much more memorable!", "Very enjoyable stay at the Hotel Pennsylvania. Right in the heart of midtown Manhattan, and was able to travel to the city in no time. Hotel service was great, and the staff was very friendly. The complimentary continental breakfast was well prepared and had a good variety. I would definitely recommend staying here, and would stay here again myself!", "The Hotel Pennsylvania New York was amazing.  This was my first time to stay in the Big Apple and I couldnt have picked a better place.  I was in love as soon as i walked in.  The entryway/foyer was amazing.  The lighting and the art everywhere was breathtaking.  The service at the front desk was top of the line.  Some of the best hotel attendants I have had.  They took care to make me feel special and personal.  Asked for any further needs and gave great directions to the room.  I have heard horror stories of New York hotels, but this room was amazing.  The view was incredible.  The decor was great.  The bed was amazingly comfortable.  I didnt want to get up in the morning.  Once I drug myself out and took a nice hot shower.  Perfect.  To top it off we took advantage of the breakfast package and was not disappointed at all.  The meal was delicious.  If I return to NYC again I will do by best to book here again.  Thank you Hotel Pennsylvania.", "After reading the reviews for Hotel Penn, I booked a room for my wife and I's first trip to New York. We were very pleased with the location as it was centrally located to the Midtown area and other local attractions. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and the bed was the most comfortable I've found in a hotel. The free continental breakfast was great! There's even a desk to help you plan and book sight-seeing trips and tours around the city. We will definitely be staying at the Hotel Penn again on a return trip!", "What better way to spend a great time in Manhattan then with a stay at Hotel Pennsylvania. Almost immediately upon arrival, my family and I felt completely welcome from the staff and the cozy accommodations. The beds fit our needs perfectly and the bathrooms were in top shape. Special props go out for the free wi-fi which was lacking at other hotel options we looked at as well as the fresh continental breakfast in the A.M. Next time I am in town for business or pleasure I will be sure to stay at the hotel.", "My stay at Hotel Pennsylvania in NY was everything I could ask for from a hotel. The free wifi they provide is one of the most basic necessities for such a busy city, and I was glad to have it included in my stay.\nSince it's New York, nearly everything is within a block of any hotel, but what I found exceptional about Hotel Pennsylvania was the free pass to use Bally's Total Fitness facilities literally right next door.\nService at the hotel was great, and even included a free breakfast, which was much appreciated. The hotel's decorations are luxurious, but the price for the stay isn't ridiculously high to match.\nOverall, I thought that the hotel was excellent, and I'll definitely consider staying there again on my next visit to the city.", "AMAZING - Absolutely had the best time and the service was amazing!  There on business but staff made me feel like one of the movie stars.  Immaculate, friendly and the best food I have ever had.  Sets the standard for 5 star.", "I recently stayed at the Waldork Astoria Hotel in New York and it was a great place.  Their website explains that they have \"set the standard worldwide for fine dining, lavish rooms and elegant events for over a century.\"  I would agree with these statements and add that the employees were also very helpful in showing me nearby places to eat as well as landmarks that were nearby.  An employee specifically recommended Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park, and I greatly enjoyed the park when I visited the next day.  I stayed at the hotel for three days and I will definitely be staying there when I return to Manhattan next month.  I will also be recommending this hotel to all of my co-workers who constantly visit Manhattan.", "My family and I took a vacation to New York city.  We wanted a lavish hotel to have a true vacation.  We found our goal in the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel.  It was wonderful, because we were in walking distance of many of our initial vacation destinations, like Central Park, Times Square and Rockefeller Center.  The wife was also very excited, because she planned to go to the Guerlain Spa located in the hotel.  After we booked our initial 3 nights, they had a special deal to give us a 4th night for free!  We had to talk it over, but having longer vacation at no charge was definitely an incentive!  The staff at the hotel were very friendly and did a wonderful job of cleaning the room.  The check-in process was very simple.  I will definitely be coming back here if I'm in New York City in the future!", "I had a great stay at Waldorf Astoria New York, they had amazing customer service I brought my girlfriend here we stayed a couple of nights, they gave us free champagne and really let us have a good time.

We will certainly stay here again and recommend to family and friends. It was a great part of our trip.", "The worldwide reputation of the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel is well-deserved. From the moment you walk into the famous Park Place hotel, you know you are guaranteed a great experience. The decor of my room was exquisite. I stayed in a simple double room but I felt like I was the president with the luxurious drapes and carpet, ample space and marble accents everywhere. A trip to the spa made all my travel stress simply disappear. I only got to try the steakhouse, but it well worth the price. The angus beef was unbeatable. And my dining partner had some smoked perch that was the best seafood I've ever had the pleasure to sample. The staff was always there at a moment's notice to meet my needs. They helped me find my way around Manhattan and made me feel like I was their only customer, even during their peak hours. The price is a little bit high, but if you can in any way afford it you won't regret one dime you pay them.", "I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in New York while on a business trip and it was phenomenal.

If you have the opportunity to splurge on a hotel, the Waldorf Astoria is the way to go.", "There are not enough positive things that I can say about our stay at the Waldorf Astoria.  The lavish entry way when we walked into the main area was breathtaking and set the tone for the whole hotel!  The rooms were so warm, cozy and rich feeling that I thought I died and gone to heaven.    The Waldorf offers fine dining and some wonderful services.    I was able to get a good workout the three days we were there in the first rate fitness center.  Just walking thru the halls made me feel like I was on top of the world.  I highly recommend the Waldorf for your NY stay.  I would imagine that a wedding here would be breathtaking.", "I would stay there again. The staff is very friendly and on top of their game.

There are plenty of access points within the hotel to the city, plus there's a spa, a fitness center, access to the wireless network within your room, and valet parking if you're the type of person who wants to be pampered during your vacation. Entering into the main lobby was a visual treat and our room had a lovely design.  We ended up eating at the Peacock Alley Restaurant at the receptionist's suggestion, and really loved it.

Made for a lovely weekend trip where we went shopping and my husband had a conference in one of the business rooms.", "When they say luxury hotel rooms they mean it!

If I ever find myself in Astoria again, I know where I will be staying.", "I had just passing by New York on a way to a conference and was looking for a place to stay. A friends recommended the Waldorf and I'm glad he did. I had never been to such an elegant hotel before. The staff was nice and courteous, especially Michelle at the front desk who was very accommodating even without a reservation. The room itself was nice and clean, which was expected given the price. Though I mostly slept through my stay and did get chance to visit the spa, and let me tell you I had the most relaxing time, it was thoroughly relaxing experience and a must if you're staying at the Waldorf. I highly recommend this hotel and it's definitely my place of choice if I ever stop by New York again.", "The Waldof Astoria hotel in New York has been absolutely amazing to me.

Each of the rooms is definitely worth the price, especially if you like living in luxury for a few days.  The amenities are also top notch. I would definitely suggest checking out the spa, but make sure you make a reservation in advance to make sure you can get in.  Their food is also delicious, although it can be a bit pricey. If you're staying at the hotel I would advise planning to eat at the Bull and Bear Prime Steak House for one dinner. The dress for that restaurant is a bit more fancy, so don't show up in shorts and a t shirt.\n\nOverall I would give this hotel 5/5 stars.  It has a great balance of glamour and comfort that makes it a wonderful place to stay.", "My wife and I recently stayed at the Waldord AStoria in New York. We had a great time in New York, visiting from Louisville. The hotel service provided to us really helped to seal the deal on returning to New York for another vacation.

The Bull and Bear Prime Steak House was great, we both got the steak and baked potato and both thought it was really good.

I stayed in one of the Deluxe guest rooms on the lower floors there while on a business trip in the Manhattan area and was well pleased. The room was spotless and everything looked brand new. The service of the front desk staff and the lobby help was excellent and very courteous, they were helpful to getting me checked in quickly and comfortably to my room.\nI unfortunately arrived late but did notice that the hotel had spa services on site as well as dining opportunities.

The attached restaurant makes this a no brainer, the food was delicious. The staff at this hotel treat you like a King (or Queen) and will cater to your needs. I recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be pampered. I will stay here again in the future.", "We stayed in The Penthouse of the Waldorf Astoria for one week, and what an amazing week it is.  This room was HUGE, with three full bedrooms and a dining room that was easily big enough to serve eight.\n\nThe view was amazing, the breakfast downstairs was delicious, and the spa on the 15th floor was exactly what I needed to unwind on my vacation.  Down next to the lobby, there is also the Peacock Alley Bar & Lounge which was a great place to get a drink and socialize at the end of the day, and the jazz piano added quite nicely to the atmosphere.\n\nReally, the whole hotel was quite accommodating and I would (and have) recommended it to several of my colleagues and friends staying in New York.", "If you ever heard of Waldorf Astoria New York Hotels you know you can expect a luxurious stay at one of New York\u2019s premier hotel chains. I am happy to say that all the good things I heard about were indeed true. \t\n\tAs soon as I walked into the hotel I was in awe of the huge lobby. This was like no other hotel I had stayed at before. Just as soon as I walked in I was greeted kindly by the staff. They were very professional and warm. The next thing I did was check in which was a breeze. The staff was eager to help me carry my luggage which was a huge help since I had more than a few bags to say the least.\n\tThe next part was what I had been anticipating, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s what most people look forward to which is the room itself. As soon as I walked in I instantly knew this was easily the best hotel I had ever had the honor to step foot in. My wife and I had the most comfortable and satisfying stay that we ever had at any hotel. We definitely  plan to come again.", "Everyone know Waldorf Astoria New York, not only for it brand name but also its hospitality.  The service here is excellent, the workers and genuinely nice and kind.\n\nIf you in New York, you should go there at least once just to see what it's like to stay at Waldorf. seriously recommend to everyone.", "I stayed here with my husband while he was on a business trip and I absolutely loved it! It was one of the classiest hotels I ever had the pleasure of staying in. The location was great and right in the city, there was 24/7 room service, an awesome 24/7 fitness center, a spa, several restaurants to choose from,  business center, and I even went on a tour and learned the history of the hotel.

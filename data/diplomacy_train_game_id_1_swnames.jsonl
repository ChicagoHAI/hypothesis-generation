{"messages":["Darth Vader!\n\nJust the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I\u2019ve always wanted to try with I\/G, but I\u2019ve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what\u2019s worse, it might make you suspicious of me. \n\nSo...do I suggest it?\n\nI\u2019m thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That\u2019s my hope anyway.\n\nWhat is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?","You've whet my appetite, Yoda. What's the suggestion?","\ud83d\udc4d","It seems like there are a lot of ways that could go wrong...I don't see why Chewbacca would see you approaching\/taking Munich--while I do nothing about it--and not immediately feel skittish","Yeah, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve tried it and it works, cause I\u2019ve never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on R2-D2, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we\u2019re really at war and you\u2019re going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with Chewbacca.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019ve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I\u2019m not offended or concerned if it\u2019s just not for you. I\u2019m happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.","I am just sensing that you don\u2019t like this idea, so shall we talk about something else? That was just a crazy idea I\u2019ve always wanted to try. I\u2019m happy to play more conservatively.","Any thoughts?","Sorry Yoda I've been away doing, um, Darth Vader things. Brewing Lagers?","I don't think I'm ready to go for that idea, however I'd be down for some good ol'-fashioned R2-D2-kicking?","I am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the \u201cbrewing lagers\u201d thing. I am going to take it literally and say \ud83d\udc4e even though I don\u2019t think you meant it deceptively. \ud83d\ude09","But I think I can get over \u201cLagergate\u201d and we can still be friends. \n\nAs of right now, I think R2-D2 may be my most reliable ally. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d like to play as a Central Trio if you have any interest in that. Thoughts?","We haven't even passed a season yet and you have a 'most reliable ally'?\n\nI'll consider this proposal but, basically, I'm not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until I've seen a bit of your behavior","Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change. \n\nI understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance. \n\nIf you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.","Just an FYI: I\u2019ve now had both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca suggest to me that I should move to Tyrolia and Chewbacca will support me to Munich in the Fall. One saying that to me is not a big deal, but with both mentioning it, my alarm bells are going off. I am concerned about an E\/F. \n\nI\u2019m certainly not moving to Tyrolia. But I just want you to be cautious here. I feel like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca are working together.","I appreciate the tip, but I'm wondering why you're so against ousting me from Munich if I haven't explicitly agreed to be your ally?","Because it is terrible, terrible play for Yoda to attack Darth Vader, in my view. If I were to attack you in Munich, I could never hold Munich. So, all I would be doing is weakening you, and helping Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, or both to get really big. \n\nI don\u2019t have any long-term path going north. Helping Chewbacca to take you down is a sucker\u2019s play, whether you are working with me or not.","Did Chewbacca tell you he was moving to Burgundy, or was that a stab?","I was not informed of it, no. And Obi-Wan Kenobi is leading me to believe it's part of a play for Belgium, so if they're working together this might be a trick...\n\nYoda, you seem like a straight shooter, and R2-D2 has confirmed with me about your two's alliance. So I'll confide in you--this is my first ever game of diplomacy, and I think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun. So, if you're still interested in a central powers alliance, I'm in.","Okay full disclosure: I'm not very smart, and I accidentally let slip to Obi-Wan Kenobi that you told me Chewbacca was plotting to take Munich. I'm sorry for the error but I figured it was better to admit it so you know that Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Chewbacca may not trust you.","Okay, thanks for telling me.","So, um, no alliance then?","I do want to be allies. Sorry, busy weekend here running around with bambinos. More to come.","What would you think of helping me take Marseilles in two turns?","Hi Darth Vader, I\u2019ll certainly consider that. Though, I\u2019ll note: traditionally, Darth Vader would help Yoda to Marseilles if the two of them work together there. The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I\u2019m basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Darth Vader would help Yoda into Marseilles to encourage Yoda to come west and Darth Vader would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.","Fair enough--I'll help you take it, then, but I'll need to deal with Belgium first.","How are things going with Obi-Wan Kenobi? I think that getting him to work with you is the main key here.","I'm trying--I just offered to assist with taking Sweden in exchange for some assistance into Belgium...not sure if they'll go for it...","I\u2019ll check with Obi-Wan Kenobi and try to see where his head is at.","I've actually been thinking about this game all day \ud83d\ude05  and have come up with a plan I like a bit better... but Obi-Wan Kenobi still hasn't responded to my initial offer.","That\u2019s the worst!\n\nAnd I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re so focused on this in your first game. It\u2019s a really great game if you put in the time and effort!","You're definitely telling the truth on that one. So can I count on you to move to piedmont this season?","I don\u2019t think I can afford to move to Piedmont this season. I don\u2019t really trust R2-D2 to avoid walking through that door if I leave it wide open. \n\nI think you need to get Obi-Wan Kenobi on board to attack Chewbacca.","That's valid. And actually I was conferring with Obi-Wan Kenobi and we concluded that it's not really gonna be possible for me to help you take Marseilles this year anyway. \n\n...what are you and R2-D2 planning for this year, then? I'm willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust. \n\nHave you communicated at all with Obi-Wan Kenobi or Chewbacca?","Hi, are you there?\n\nJust woke up. \n\nObi-Wan Kenobi did return my message, but he did not tell me anything substantive so I really don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019m planning to move towards Han Solo.","Well, you\u2019re in trouble. That Obi-Wan Kenobi move is trouble. \n\nI\u2019m going to try to convince him to change course. I suggest you be very kind to him, and don\u2019t burn that bridge. I think your game hinges on turning Obi-Wan Kenobi around.","Hi Darth Vader,\n\nI\u2019m working hard on turning Obi-Wan Kenobi. And I\u2019m also trying to get Luke Skywalker to come to your aid. Doing the best I can! I\u2019ll keep you posted.","Obi-Wan Kenobi just told me that Luke Skywalker is helping them to take Denmark so that may be a lost cause. Granted, the source for that intel is a serpentine jackal-spawn","Okay, I\u2019m reasonably sure that Obi-Wan Kenobi wants to take the Channel and attack Chewbacca now. \n\nI believe that you should basically do whatever Obi-Wan Kenobi asks to help make this happen. As long as E attacks F, you will be in a much better position, and you\u2019ll gain back centers quickly. \n\nWhat are you hearing?","What are your plans for this turn? I can't help but notice that Munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides...\n\nI wish I could be more helpful but I'm pretty much just treading water right now trying not to lose anything else","Hey \u2014 sorry, just getting back into this now.","I have good news! (1) I am finally attacking Chewbacca this turn. (2) I will be supporting Munich to hold from Tyrolia. \n\nLet\u2019s turn this game around, yes?","I am pretty sure that Obi-Wan Kenobi is not attacking you this turn. And I am committed to supporting Munich holding. Make sure you don\u2019t move Munich so that it can take my support.","Okay, can do. Thanks!","I suggest that you order:\nKiel Support Berlin holding\nBerlin Support Munich holding\nHelg to Holland\nMunich Support Berlin holding","I agree completely--although I didn't know that a country could hold *and* support at the same time! Thanks!","Thanks Yoda. Hope you're enjoying the weather on the Anatolian \ud83d\ude09","I will be supporting Munich to hold again. And I\u2019ll be trying to get Luke Skywalker to back off your flank and protect himself against an R2-D2n stab that is coming.","Two bits of advice: #1 I suggest you tell Luke Skywalker that R2-D2 is coming for him. You really want Luke Skywalker to move Sil back to Gal. You might also suggest to Luke Skywalker that is he supports you to Denmark, you will then support Luke Skywalker back to Sweden. I don\u2019t know yet if it actually makes sense to do that, but you want Luke Skywalker thinking that you are eager to work with him. He\u2019ll be hoping for a reason to break off his attack on you at this point.","#2 Here is the move set I would suggest right now:\nKiel Support Holland holding\nHolland Support Wales to Belgium (tell Obi-Wan Kenobi you are going to order this support and he can take it or leave it)\nMunich Support Berlin holding\nBerlin Support Munich holding\n\nI think that both Chewbacca and Luke Skywalker are about to back off you, as they are both under fire at home. Just hold still, and soon you should be able to break out of this holding pattern.","God, I hope so! I'm attempting to make that deal with Luke Skywalker now...and I'm talking with Obi-Wan Kenobi re: Belgium","It\u2019s none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting Obi-Wan Kenobi fully committed against Chewbacca. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.","I think me and Obi-Wan Kenobi are really on the same page at this point regarding Chewbacca. I'm actually sort of running counter-intelligence for Obi-Wan Kenobi (and my friends to the south, of course!) with Luke Skywalker right now. \n\nObi-Wan Kenobi and I talked about Denmark too...and it seems like one or the other of Denmark or Belgium should work out for me this year and I'm fine with that","Great to hear. Thank you.","Do you need me to disrupt Bur this year? I'll need to seriously trust Luke Skywalker if I'm going to risk not holding my eastern front, I think...","I do think a move to Burgundy makes sense for you this turn, and I can\u2019t imagine Luke Skywalker attacking you here. He has a serious R2-D2 problem. \n\nI suggest this:\nMun - Bur\nRuh - Bel\nHol Support Ruh - Bel \nBer - Kie\n\nTell Luke Skywalker that the last thing in the world you want to see is R2-D2 run him over, and you\u2019re willing to help keep Luke Skywalker viable if necessary (you\u2019re angling for Luke Skywalker to disband his northern holdings this turn).","And ask Obi-Wan Kenobi nicely to support Ruh - Hol, with the explanation that you don\u2019t plan to ask for Denmark back, but you think it would help you both to diminish Chewbacca. (You\u2019ll get Den back eventually, but you want Obi-Wan Kenobi to think you don\u2019t care about it).","Thanks, I'll work on these. \n...Why didn't you scooch into the Aegean behind R2-D2? You could have defended or even held Bulgaria this turn?","Obi-Wan Kenobi and I were talking about your moves for this season--what do you think of convoying Pie into Spa, supporting this with Wes, and then moving Tyr into Pie?","This leaves Marseilles open for Bur to fall into if Chewbacca goes that route, which gives me an opening into Bur","That\u2019s not bad.","I was kind of thinking I should pick one or the other of Marseilles or Spain to attack and not tell a soul which one I\u2019m going after.","Do you really think it\u2019s important to coordinate?","I do think you\u2019re best off moving to Burgundy. And there is some chance that we fail this turn. But I think we just take a guess and hope for the best. We\u2019ll get him next turn if not this one.","Okay\u2014sorry for being nosy! I will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way","Nah, you\u2019re not being nosy at all. I mean, come on, we both know that I have no problem sticking my nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.","Marked as true","I like to coordinate, but on these sort of 50\/50 guesses, I kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesn\u2019t go well, I have nobody to blame but myself.","Ha!","Well, are you willing to humor my question about the Aegean, anyway?","Sure. I was thinking of moving that fleet to Ionian. You think a move to Aegean is better? I\u2019m not really sure, but let\u2019s talk it through.","No sorry I meant in hindsight--like this past turn you should have moved to Aeg so that this current turn, when R2-D2 takes Rumania (from Bulgaria), you'd be there to cover Bulgaria so it couldn't get scooped by the Black sea, and potentially you'd just get to take it.","Not a bad point. I agree.","Hmmmm, kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won\u2019t hold it against you. You\u2019re in a tough spot.","um what lie? I did exactly the moves you suggested!","Ha! So sorry!! I meant that for Chewbacca!","You are my favorite.","Marked as lie because clearly R2-D2 is your favorite.\nSpeaking of, I assume that your seizing Trieste was mutually agreed upon?","Yes \u2014 agreed upon.","That's not what R2-D2 said to Obi-Wan Kenobi...","Hmmmm, okay. Well, let\u2019s just keep that between you and me then. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","You know Yoda, I think we *do* need to coordinate your move this time--Obi-Wan Kenobi and I have a shot at either Bur or Mao if one of Marseilles or Spain can be left open for Chewbacca to fall into. This will improve all of our chances of crushing Chewbacca quickly.","Okay, I can dig it. What do you want me to do?","Let me confer with Obi-Wan Kenobi and get back to you. Glad to hear that though!","So...any thoughts on how to approach this?","It looks like Obi-Wan Kenobi's not willing to try for MAO if it means possibly losing the channel. However, they'll bring the NWG fleet around to try for MAO next year. \nSo if you could keep Marseilles open, it will help me to try and take Burgundy this turn.","If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)","Will do.","Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that R2-D2 wasn't lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next. Are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the Tri unit, or at least to warn me before any move into Tyrolia?","Sure. But, you\u2019ll see from my moves this turn that R2-D2 is lying to you.","I currently have Tri - Tyrolia. I like the unit there because it sets up an attack on R2-D2 if I ever want to go that route (build A Ven and go east). Do you want me to keep Tyrolia clear?","I\u2019ll add \u2014 I would never attack Darth Vader as Yoda. Setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible. It would be a terrible move.","Not when that column is not-so-giant and in a turf war with Chewbacca.","oh you mean setting *yourself*","But you could easily pick off, say, Munich and not be a \"giant column\"","I mean this sincerely: any Darth Vader who does that is a terrible player. \n\nWhy would I do that? I would need 2-3 units to hold one center. That is a net negative. And all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors. \n\nI\u2019ve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back Chewbacca and Obi-Wan Kenobi. I can say with 100% certainty: I\u2019m not going to attack you. I\u2019m going to keep helping you as much as I can.","That said, if you want me NOT to move to Tyrolia, I won\u2019t move there.","Nah, I just needed some reassurance :)\nYour logic is undenyable\u2014 enjoy your stay in tyr!","*undeniable? That looks better","I mean it sincerely. I think that Obi-Wan Kenobi will want to coax me to attack you with him after Chewbacca falls, but I\u2019d much rather work with you against Obi-Wan Kenobi. \n\nBut first thing\u2019s first \u2014 let\u2019s get rid of Chewbacca.","Agreed","(On the Chewbacca part)","Sorry I won't be able to cut off Gascony this turn...I probably should have just told you my moves; you could have advised me that supporting Mun-Bur was more important than Kie-Ruh","No worries. We\u2019ll crack this but eventually. \n\nHere is my suggestion for this turn:\nKie - Den\nHol S Bel holding\nBel S Ruh - Bur\nMun S Ruh - Bur\nRuh - Bur","I think you should suggest to Obi-Wan Kenobi that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That\u2019s only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against Chewbacca and you plan to continue to do that.","The moves I had already planned differ in one respect: I thought it would be worth the risk to try moving Hol-Bel and therefore move Bel-Bur. Even if me and Chewbacca are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it's still mine, and it's not like Holland has anything better to do while I'm still allies with Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\n...The only reason I'm reluctant to make that agreement with Obi-Wan Kenobi is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with R2-D2 much at all, and I'm the next logical target for them when Luke Skywalker's gone. And anything that's bad for Luke Skywalker right now is good for R2-D2.","Hmmmm, I\u2019m just not sure you should trust Obi-Wan Kenobi enough right now to leave Holland open and Belgium essentially unguarded. \n\nChewbacca is a really good player, and he is no doubt working hard to get Obi-Wan Kenobi to turn on you. My personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have Denmark back and Obi-Wan Kenobi has moved another fleet towards Chewbacca. But I can see it either way.","With regard to Luke Skywalker, talk it through with Obi-Wan Kenobi. What you don\u2019t want is Obi-Wan Kenobi taking out Luke Skywalker and giving you nothing. So, if Obi-Wan Kenobi agrees to let Luke Skywalker be for a while, then your plan sounds good. But if Obi-Wan Kenobi is going to take Sweden, you really should get Denmark back. (I\u2019m my view)","Okay you've convinced me: it's worth figuring out what E's plans are for Luke Skywalker at least.\n\nAnd you're almost certainly right, from a rational perspective, about leaving Holland\/Belgium vulnerable to Obi-Wan Kenobi. But I think Obi-Wan Kenobi really is counting on my assistance in taking Chewbacca, and because of that and other non-quantifiable reasons I trust them.","Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with Obi-Wan Kenobi than I do. Just know that Chewbacca is persuasive, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what he\u2019s working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he\u2019s trying to turn Obi-Wan Kenobi. Just keep reassuring Obi-Wan Kenobi that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn\u2019t succumb to the Dark Side.","Hi Darth Vader \u2014 well, I think we\u2019re getting to a critical point in the game here. Chewbacca held out a long time, but he\u2019s much less of a threat now. I think the critical issue, for you, is Obi-Wan Kenobi. \n\nI have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I\u2019d like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us. I think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn. You even tell me the truth when it\u2019s bad news, or when you don\u2019t completely trust me, and I like that.","Okay, Yoda. I won't share any of this conversation. But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here's what I think: Obi-Wan Kenobi is a greater threat to *me* on the map, but *you* have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly, or pair-winning with R2-D2 even sooner. And if I continue to collaborate with Obi-Wan Kenobi, we at least have a chance of slowing that down. So I'm in sort of a conflicted spot","This is why I like you. The full disclosure part. You tell me the truth even when the news isn\u2019t great.","My thoughts on the \u201cDarth Vader\/Obi-Wan Kenobi forever so that at least we can stop the solo\u201d strategy: (1) It\u2019s quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and R2-D2 could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don\u2019t think Obi-Wan Kenobi is thinking that way. I think he\u2019s thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he\u2019s like to be that dominant power.","Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s pieces are not positioned well if he\u2019s trying to attack Chewbacca or contain Yoda. He keeps Denmark guarded, and North Sea filled. He is not playing like he intends to stick with you, even though I\u2019m sure he\u2019s telling you that.","You\u2019re right that you don\u2019t want to start a war with Obi-Wan Kenobi right now. But, you must stick up for yourself, because nobody else will do that if you don\u2019t.","If I were you, this is what I would do: (1) keep warning Obi-Wan Kenobi about the dangers of Yoda getting too big and insist that Obi-Wan Kenobi moves his fleets towards MAO (Channel to Irish, Norwegian to NAO, North - Channel), (2) insist on taking Denmark back.","I would say something like this:\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi, I\u2019m with you my friend, but we\u2019re passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key. I need to take Denmark back. I\u2019m happy to support you to Brest to keep you growing, or you can grab Sweden. You have plenty of options other than keeping your ally\u2019s center, but if you really want to be my ally long-term, you\u2019ve got to show me that.","I am hearing from Obi-Wan Kenobi signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon. And I think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do.","Well, both you and Chewbacca have now pointed out that Obi-Wan Kenobi is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now, and you are correct. I'll be more cautious with my northern border, but I made a pretty strong argument for denmark this past turn and it fell on deaf ears","...which probably also should have been a sign for me","Well, if you want, you could just take Denmark this next year and I don\u2019t think Obi-Wan Kenobi is in a position to retaliate.","Probably not...has Chewbacca been talking with you at all about their sunsetting strategy? They've indicated a willingness to work with you and me and a desire to see Obi-Wan Kenobi get as few dots as possible","He did say that to me too. Though, Chewbacca has a long history of lying to me, so I really don\u2019t trust him.","Well Chewbacca has actually been pretty honest with me, and I at least am certain that they wouldn't betray me to Obi-Wan Kenobi. So, I'm considering working with F to sabotage (or potentially full-on backstab) Obi-Wan Kenobi this turn, which would have the side-effect of maybe taking some attention away from the south for you anyway.","(and I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you're in the mood to give out free advice)","Hi Darth Vader \u2014 sorry for the delay. Well...I think it\u2019s really important that you get a build this turn either way. I don\u2019t think Obi-Wan Kenobi will get a build this turn, so if I were you I\u2019d probably take Paris, build a fleet, and move on Obi-Wan Kenobi after that.","But it likely depends on how communication is going with Obi-Wan Kenobi. If he\u2019ll give you back Denmark, that might change the equation.","I am waiting on Obi-Wan Kenobi to make a decision about that--they claim to be thinking about it.","Obi-Wan Kenobi told me you said I was plotting with Chewbacca. It makes sense you\u2019d want to pit us against each other.","Hey \u2014 tried to send you a message earlier but not was down. Obi-Wan Kenobi was telling me that you\u2019re saying that I told you that Obi-Wan Kenobi is plotting against you. The problem with telling Obi-Wan Kenobi that is that he will stop giving me useful info.","Truly, I don\u2019t want you and Obi-Wan Kenobi to fight. I am not trying to break you up. I suggested that you take Paris! I want you guys to work together with me against Chewbacca.","You don't want us to fight, yet you betrayed both of our confidence with you in a way that makes us distrust each other?","I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair description. You guys both wanted to attack each other. I encouraged you both to keep working together.","Just as long as it suits you. Are you going to give Obi-Wan Kenobi Mao?","Hmmm, should I be reading that as angry sarcastic with dagger eyes? (I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m getting your tone right)","We\u2019re friends, right? I believe that every single message I\u2019ve sent you all game has been truth, and I\u2019ve gone out of my way to give you candid advice. Are we still friends?","Regarding MAO \u2014 I don\u2019t know. What do you want me to do? I don\u2019t have any set plan.","Yep, there's some sarcasm there. Looking back at your messages, I still don't read them as encouraging collaboration. And if you wanted us to be friends, you could have done that without betraying me to Obi-Wan Kenobi by simply saying in your candid way \"I don't think you should do that for such and such reason\". But you chose to increase E's distrust of me. So I think you might be full of gnocchi and crap. \n\nMy trust in you is a bit shaken but I still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end. It would be my preference that you hold Mao, on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or Obi-Wan Kenobi, you'd choose me. If that's not the case, then as the filling of an Obi-Wan Kenobi-Yoda sandwich I'm in no position to retaliate anyway.","Well, again, I like that you\u2019re honest with me, even when the news is bad.","I have to say that I\u2019m surprised that you feel that I\u2019ve betrayed your trust. I have been feeling like maybe I\u2019ve been TOO helpful to you, and been a bit over the top in offering advice, etc., but it seems like I\u2019ve misread the situation.","No, it's completely true that you've been too helpful, and I'm really really grateful for it because I've been able to learn so much from this game. But it's also true that you didn't have to tell Obi-Wan Kenobi what you did, and all you stood to gain from it was that it shook my and E's trust in each other.","But I understand what you\u2019re saying, and I much prefer to have a heart to heart like this, a frank airing of grievances, rather than being surprised by unkind moves on the board. https:\/\/youtu.be\/xoirV6BbjOg","Was not expecting seinfeld today and it was a pleasant surprise","\ud83e\udd17","Here\u2019s the deal: I like you better than Obi-Wan Kenobi.","I\u2019m not sure how the next couple of turns are going to shake out. But I like that you tell me when you\u2019re angry with me. I know that may seem like a small thing, but it\u2019s just rare in Diplomacy. You get so many fake smiles.","So, if it comes down to you or him, I\u2019m choosing you. And I\u2019ll work to do a better job of keeping your confidence. I certainly understand how important that is, as I hate it when people o that same thing to me.","So no more playing mediator for me.","Okay. Is it true that you want the channel?","And are you planning to keep Vienna?","I am not planning to keep Vienna. And yeah I\u2019ve asked Chewbacca for support to the Channel. Do you think he\u2019s on board?","I'm not sure. Is *Obi-Wan Kenobi* on board? Is this something Obi-Wan Kenobi can know about?","No, do you think Chewbacca will Support me to the Channel?","Chewbacca has asked my opinion on it, and I haven't given it yet. To my estimation things look a lot better for me if you don't end up there: I don't want to see Obi-Wan Kenobi in Mao, and I don't want to see you snagging pieces of the north.","Okay, well, here is my thinking. Tell Chewbacca whatever you want to make him happy. Then tell me how you really feel. And if you don\u2019t want me to go there, I won\u2019t go there.","If I hadn't asked you about it, would that have just been another surprise, too?","Absolutely. \n\nYou and I have discussed our moves and been honest with each other every turn. But we have not been sharing all our moves or pre-clearing all of our moves. So that would have Ben a surprise in the same way that your moves are a surprise to me. (I never tell you what to do or insist on knowing).","I kind of thought that you would have wanted me in the Channel because it commits me further against Obi-Wan Kenobi, but I can understand what you\u2019re saying now about wanting me to hang back.","But I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with me contemplating moves without telling you all of them. You asked me about it, and I told you the truth.","I do think that this move is a breach of general expectation, which is the kind of thing I'd like to know about. And it's also the kind of thing I've shared with you: case in point, my desire to stab Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Okay. Understood.","Is there anything I could gain from seeing you in the channel? Would you support me taking Nth, and potentially seizing the island?","Here's what I'm thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I'd give Chewbacca the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you'd be open to supporting some anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise.\n\nIf you don't want to agree to those terms, that's okay, but I would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case.","I\u2019m going to be out of pocket this weekend, so let\u2019s talk this through more on Monday. Generally, I agree that I\u2019ll either stay out of the Channel or agree to your terms for entering there.","If you decide to stay out of the channel, I have a deal that I like with Obi-Wan Kenobi in the works. For that deal to go through, you'd have to agree to move Mao into Portugal to let Obi-Wan Kenobi take Mao. Would you be amenable to that?","(If this second offer is more to think about than a no-brainer, you can just mull it over and let me know monday)","So, here is my concern with the Obi-Wan Kenobi offer: If I\u2019m taking Portugal, why do we want Obi-Wan Kenobi in MAO? And why would he want to go to MAO? I\u2019m not sure I understand that one. Can you explain?","Well, when I initially proposed the deal I had forgotten that Portugal was promised to Obi-Wan Kenobi. Then Obi-Wan Kenobi agreed to it on the condition that you would confirm that move, so I figured E thought you would just move out of there next year? But now that I think about it, it\u2019s probably worth asking Obi-Wan Kenobi why they\u2019d agree to that.","I\u2019d prefer that you not tell Obi-Wan Kenobi I am considering moving to the Channel. I don\u2019t think he would like that.","I don\u2019t really want to discuss this stuff with Obi-Wan Kenobi at all.","Well, Obi-Wan Kenobi changed their mind about the plan I offered anyway. So, are you taking the channel?","No, I\u2019m not taking the Channel.","Okay was that a recent decision? Because like an hour ago Chewbacca said they were supporting you into the channel","Well, when I tell you what I plan to do, do you turn around and tell Chewbacca? This makes me uncomfortable speaking with you.","I haven't spoken to Chewbacca since then. I didn't realize you were giving the two of us different information on this particular subject. But I don't think I've revealed anything to them about what you plan to do. Mostly because you haven't told me.","Well, I have been honest with both you and Chewbacca. You told me that I need to promise you a set of things in order to take the Channel. I felt like it was more than I could be sure of doing, so I am not entering the Channel. I won\u2019t go there without your permission.","I appreciate that. And I'll keep the remainder of this conversation between us unless I hear otherwise. Have you just recently made an agreement with Obi-Wan Kenobi?","I heard as much but I want to verify the contents of that agreement with you","Btw, Chewbacca just said that they submitted the orders to support you into the channel.","I don\u2019t have an agreement with Obi-Wan Kenobi, but he is asking me about my moves and trying to get my help.","Okay--then Obi-Wan Kenobi is lying to me, saying that you're helping support Eng-Brest.","Ha! Yeah, fat chance.","...but did you lie to Obi-Wan Kenobi about that? Or can I say to Obi-Wan Kenobi that I don't think you'll actually provide that support?","What is Paris up to?","I suggest you just not tell Obi-Wan Kenobi anything about my moves.","Do you want me to support Obi-Wan Kenobi to Brest?","I guess I\u2019m not sure what your goals are here.","I just kind of feel like you\u2019re grilling me with a lot of questions, but not telling me what you\u2019re doing or what you want from me.","*If* you support Eng-Brest, Obi-Wan Kenobi has agreed to vacate denmark for me. If you don't, I won't get in the way of your channel thing. Any other questions?","I have no sense of what you want or what your plan is, but I thought I'd been pretty clear: I want Denmark. I am reluctant to see you in the Channel if Obi-Wan Kenobi remains powerful, but happy to see you there if they are weakened.","Can\u2019t you just force Denmark?","Not without risking a swipe of Belgium","And why force when you don't have to","Okay, I\u2019ll support Obi-Wan Kenobi to Brest. You take Denmark.","And you and I should be in position to take out Obi-Wan Kenobi next year.","Splendid!","Glad everything worked out \ud83d\ude03","\ud83d\udc4d","Congratulations on retaking Denmark and getting two builds. You are playing really well right now. Respect.","Congrats on having double-digit dots! I have some thoughts about taking out Obi-Wan Kenobi, if you want to go full-stab this season...","I think I do! \ud83e\udd2b","What are you thinking?","One option is to take the channel, another is to take Brest. Between you, me, and Picardy we can manage either, but it's a question of which takes priority. If we chose Brest, I could also take a stab at seizing Nth this season, then we could try for the channel in fall. Or we could do channel first, Brest second.","Yeah, that is all along the lines of what I\u2019m thinking. How demanding does Chewbacca sound right now? Does he want to be the one who takes Brest?","Haven't asked. But in general not demanding.","Good!\n\nStill, I think we should show him some good faith by supporting him to Brest in Spring. We can decide in Fall whether it makes more sense for you to take it, but I think we want to keep Chewbacca hungry.","I would suggest something like this to ensure the Obi-Wan Kenobi fleet is disbanded:\nPic - Bre\nMAO - Channel\nPar S Pic - Bre","And Spa - Gas to cut off that retreat.","You can take the North Sea on the same move and set up a convoy to the Obi-Wan Kenobi mainland. \n\nCheckmate.","Okay, I like the plan! I've asked Chewbacca if they're willing to move to Brest supported by me.","Aren't you concerned about Obi-Wan Kenobi taking Mao? I'd sooner just have you pile on support into Bre so that Wes can support Mao holding","That\u2019s a good point, but the problem with that approach is that Brest is not guaranteed. If Obi-Wan Kenobi cute MAO and supports with the Channel, the attack fails. I think we are better off ensuring that the Brest fleet is disbanded. If we disband that fleet and take North Sea, an Obi-Wan Kenobi fleet in MAO really just spreads him out and allows you to take the island faster. It\u2019s not like he can get Portugal or Spain.","Okay, but that means I'd prefer to take Brest myself this Spring, if Chewbacca is okay with it.","I think that we should offer Chewbacca Brest in Spring. That ensures that he is with us. Then, if conditions are right in the Fall, I can support you into Brest. But...Obi-Wan Kenobi can offer Chewbacca Belgium, and I think he is sure to take that if we\u2019re not even offering him a center, right?","Better to keep Chewbacca feeling like we\u2019re going to keep him in the game. If you need the build in Fall, it\u2019s easy for me to support you there.","I guess I\u2019m just wondering from Chewbacca\u2019s perspective why they\u2019d *want* to stay in the game. Isn\u2019t it possible they\u2019d rather move on with their life? That\u2019s not rhetorical, I\u2019m wondering what your perspective is as a veteran player","Here is my take: If Chewbacca just wanted to go down in a blaze of glory and say \u201ceff you\u201d to Obi-Wan Kenobi, he would have kept Irish Sea. He kept Pic, which is next to his home center, and gives him a chance to negotiate with both you and Obi-Wan Kenobi.","I think that means he is motivated to keep trying. And if he believes he can get Brest, he could legitimately get back to his feet. I know that\u2019s what I\u2019d be trying to do in his position.","As the poker saying goes: \u201ca chip and a chair.\u201d So long as you have one chip left, and you\u2019re still in the tournament, you can always come back to win.","Thoughts?","I think that makes sense. Are you talking with Obi-Wan Kenobi at all?","I\u2019m pretty wary of Obi-Wan Kenobi right now. He asked me what I want to do, but I feel like he\u2019s trying to get me to leave MAO open. That\u2019s not terrible news, as it suggests that he won\u2019t expect your move to North Sea.","As long as he doesn\u2019t move NAO to Norwegian, you\u2019ve got a guaranteed supply center.","Well E'd have to be a right dolt not to retreat to NWG. And right now they're talking to me about supporting a move from Bre to Gas (the better for the two of us to stab you).","What i mean is, there's a good chance that Mao is safe if I \"agree\" to that deal","Oh nevermind--they're not going to convoy into Brest. So actually this pretty much guarantees that Eng and Nao will try for Mao.","Ahhhh, sneaky Devil! Thank you for letting me know.","I still like our plan.","I need to run for a bit. I\u2019ll be around in a few hours.","I think that knowing this, you should do as I suggest and not poke Eng. Just hold and let Wes support. I am 94% sure I can trust Obi-Wan Kenobi to do as they say on this one.","Okay. Should I support Pic to Bre?","yes please. It'll do us good with Chewbacca too if we both support.","\ud83d\udc4d","Actually, you should use Mao to support Spa-Gas, since we know that Brest is moving there. It will be beneficial to have you there if we decide to oust Chewbacca from Bre in fall","Consider it done.","Hmmmm, heading anything from Obi-Wan Kenobi?","I\u2019d love to talk if you\u2019re there. I\u2019m getting the impression that Obi-Wan Kenobi may actually be moving on you, and I think I have a good counter, but I also still think we should support the attack on Brest and take North Sea.","I definitely think you should keep your moves the same.","Nice! Get\u2019em! He WAS moving on you. But we should be able to take about 3 off of him now. Very nice turn.","Sorry; I was asleep by 9 last night \ud83d\ude02  \n\nwhy the move to Nao? Wouldn't IRI be the more anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi choice?\n\nWith the move to Picardy and assuming a retreat to SKA, it looks like Obi-Wan Kenobi has me pretty powerless this turn.","So do you, it seems, if you have some kind of deal with Luke Skywalker about Munich.","Good morning. \n\nJust responding to your messages above. I think NAO and Irish are equally anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. They both give me a clear lane to attack Liverpool. I wasn\u2019t sure if either one would be left open, but I took a gamble and it paid off.","Re your move this turn, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re powerless. You should get a build I think and if not, you should be in position to smash Obi-Wan Kenobi.","I don\u2019t have a deal regarding Munich, Darth Vader. Frankly, I thought you would be a bit more joyful towards me. By attacking Obi-Wan Kenobi, I have committed completely to working as your partner.","I suppose you're right. Initially I was thinking IRI also gives you channel access, but NWG access may be just as useful. \n\nWell when you control half a continent (and even more when you consider your influence over me, R2-D2, and who knows who else!), there's no such thing as complete commitment. I'm not so naive as to think your allegiance with me is going to last beyond its usefulness, and with two fleets on the British isle that time is fast approaching. To be clear, I'm still giving you the truth and I still want to work with you. But you should really stop acting surprised when I'm slightly paranoid that a soon-to-be-dozen-dot-holder is gearing up to stab me","Well, I dunno, it sounds like I should stab you. Is that what you\u2019re trying to tell me?\n\nI like you. I like how hard you\u2019ve worked in this game to rebound from a difficult start. I like that you e told me the truth, even when the news was bad. I like that you tell me when you don\u2019t trust me. I have literally never told you a lie in this game, and I don\u2019t intend to start now. Last turn I burned my bridge with Obi-Wan Kenobi beyond repair. If you don\u2019t want to work with me now, that\u2019s really disappointing.","like I said, I *do* want to work with you. However, remember that thing I said about general expectations and being warned when they're broken? Tyrolia is one of them and I think you knew that. And Obi-Wan Kenobi *also* told me they've never told me a lie; I'm starting to think that's Diplomacy-speak for \"when convenient, I've used careful wording and half-truths to deceive you even when everything I said was technically true\". \n\nIt would help me to know that you see me being a benefit to you beyond taking out Obi-Wan Kenobi. A natural next move for us would be to take out Luke Skywalker, and in that arena I have a positional advantage over you. Especially if I get two builds this turn, I'll be able to sneak behind the troops in bohemia\/galicia and help you break through.","Yes \u2014 here is how I expect and hope the game will play out: the two of us finish off Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca, while drifting towards the east a bit. With the builds we get this year, we essentially blitzkrieg the East. I have more units than you, but you have no opposition at all in the north, and can take Scandinavia, War and Mos without any trouble.","I think that, in about two years, you and I will both be on about 14 centers, with the remnants of Luke Skywalker and R2-D2 between us, and we can decide how we want to resolve it. I\u2019d be happy to agree to a small draw, or to shoot for a 17-17 two-way draw position, whichever you prefer.","Well, I like the sound of all of that. In fact, it sounds ideal: there's something poetic about the complete beginner and the expert (you've probably heard by now that you got doxxed) sharing a victory. \n\nI ask for a concession: As a show of good will, would you be willing to take only one of Liverpool or Portugal this year? (I know the Portugal request seems weird, but I like keeping Chewbacca around and unless I'm mistaken they like me better than you \ud83d\ude03 )","Yes. I wasn\u2019t planning to take Portugal anyway.","I think it makes sense here for you to land an army in the Obi-Wan Kenobi island while you can. Now that his army is off the island, he\u2019s toast as soon as you do that.","Obi-Wan Kenobi's just vindictive enough to try and stab Belgium with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Picardy, though. I was planning on keeping holland around as support.","*by Obi-Wan Kenobi I of course mean Eng","I suggest the following:\n\nGas - Liv (via convoy)\nSpa S MAO holding\nMar hold\nTyr - Tri\n\nHol - Yor (via convoy)\nBur S Bel\nBel S North\nHEL S North\nMun - Boh\nPar - Pic (to cut any potential support)","Obi-Wan Kenobi cannot take Belgium with those moves.","Or I could move my fleet into Liverpool and use Gas to support Bre. I\u2019m happy either way.","I tried a double convoy in the sandbox once and it didn't work! What is this witchcraft?!?","At any rate, I prefer the fleet move to liverpool and Gascony's support into Brest. And could Mao support Bre into the Channel? No sense forcing Chewbacca to disband. Bel will support it, too.","Here are the orders needed to do a convoy!\nHolland move to Yorkshire\nNorth Sea convoy Holland to Yorkshire\n\nIt is not a \u201cdouble convoy\u201d as you only need one fleet to make it happen. \n\nBut if your fleet in North Sea is dislodged, the convoy will not go through. That is why I would suggest that HELG supports North Sea holding and Belgium supports North Sea holding.","No--I mean the one *you* were planning: Gascony to Liverpool","It's a double convoy because you're convoying through Mao *and* Nao","Ah, the orders there would be:\nGascony - Liv\nMAO Convoy Gas - Liv\nNAO Convoy Gas - Liv","So, I\u2019ll move the fleet to Liverpool. And you want MAO to support Paris to Brest?","Or wait, MAO supports Brest to Channel, and Gas supports Paris - Brest, right?","yeah. I tried that once in the sandbox (or the equivalent: back when you had fleets in Lyo and Wes I tried  a convoy from Pie to Naf). But I think I messed up the commands to the fleets. \n\n And yes the most recent message is correct. Those two things and Nao-Lvp","Okay, confirmed. \n\nSo I\u2019ve got in:\nNAO - Liv\nMAO S Bre - Channel\nGas S Par - Bre\nSpa - WES\nMar S Gas holding \nTyrolia - Trieste\n\nSound right?","It does. But If Tyr was bound for trieste anyway, why did you detour through Tyr at all? Why not just move to trieste last turn??","R2-D2 would not have liked it.","And he doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s headed back there now (please don\u2019t tell)","Understood. Me and R2-D2 don't talk anyway. Also, do you have any sense of what Obi-Wan Kenobi is planning to do?","Ha! No I don\u2019t. I\u2019d imagine he is coming for me. But I don\u2019t know that.","If I were him, I\u2019d defend Edi and London.","So you haven't been talking to Obi-Wan Kenobi at all? I was sort of hoping you would know more, maybe help us take better advantage of their plans.","Anyway, my moves are:\n\nPar-Bre\nBel s Bre-Eng\nHol s Bel holding\n\nAnd the rest within expected parameters. Correct?","Obi-Wan Kenobi has not said anything of substance to me. He was gracious about my move, but he won\u2019t trust me again, and I would not trust anything he might say at this point. I haven\u2019t asked him about his moves and he hasn\u2019t told me.","I thought you would Convoy Holland to Yorkshire and support Belgium from Burgundy. Also, can you please order Mun to Boh to cut support and allow me to hold Vienna while moving Tyrolia to Trieste?","I *told* you I'm not risking that convoy *and* that instead Bel is supporting Chewbacca into the Channel (which will heretofore be called the Chewbacca Channel). And could I persuade you to move to IRI instead of taking Liverpool in exchange for the requested cut?","Sorry, what is the requested cut? I understand that you don\u2019t want me to take Liverpool or Portugal. What are you offering to me? (I don\u2019t mean to be difficult, I just want to be sure I understand).","Ah, you must mean Munich to Boh.","Asking me to avoid taking Por and Liv is asking a lot. I want Chewbacca to survive here, but I also want Obi-Wan Kenobi taking units off the board, and I feel like you should too, right?","I do. But I also want those dots for myself, of course. And there's still the nonzero chance that you've arranged with Boh to take Munich for yourself, so I'm taking a serious risk","I will avoid taking Portugal, vacate Tyrolia, and support you to Brest. I feel like I\u2019m offering quite a lot in exchange for one cut support. \n\nAnd cutting that support does not put you in greater peril. If I had a deal with Luke Skywalker for Munich (I don\u2019t) I could cut Burgundy from Marseilles and support Luke Skywalker to Munich. Moving Mun to Boh to cut support is costless.","You're right. I just thought I'd put my best argument forward. I'll do the cut. But I ask for something costless in exchange, and I really, really want it to stay just between us, ok?","Understood and agreed.","And I have no problem with you asking for more than you\u2019re willing to settle for. That\u2019s smart, and I do the same thing sometimes. If you don\u2019t stick up for yourself, nobody else will.","I *know* there's more to your relationship with Obi-Wan Kenobi than you're telling me. The last message Obi-Wan Kenobi sent to me hinted that if *I* wasn't willing to work with them--and I haven't said anything to them since--that maybe *you* would. And if Obi-Wan Kenobi were to reach out to you, you're too smart to just snub them. There's advantage to be gained--either for both of us or just for yourself--from talking to them. The only reason I stopped was because I knew my word would be mud to them anyway.\n\nEarlier I was hoping you'd give me the truth about what you knew, and about what they might know. But you didn't and that both disappoints and scares me. So I'm asking that you give me just a modicum of honesty here: what do you know? what does Obi-Wan Kenobi know?","I give you my word: I don\u2019t know what Obi-Wan Kenobi is going to do and I haven\u2019t asked.","He is still jovial with me and respectful. He has asked me to critique his play and to give him advice. But I do not know his moves, and I really don\u2019t think he would tell me them if I asked. It certainly would not be info I could trust free I just lied to him about mine.","But Obi-Wan Kenobi's desperate. Better to talk with *someone* than just go in blind. And I doubt they'd turn to Luke Skywalker or Chewbacca because neither is really close enough\/powerful enough to give real help. And there's precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: Chewbacca.\n\n...and here's the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you've been sneaky and you've always pitted me and Obi-Wan Kenobi against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial Obi-Wan Kenobi seeking your advice, it would be so *easy* to just feed Obi-Wan Kenobi enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. \n\nI know this from experience: back when you were doing 50\/50 shots in the south of Chewbacca, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to Chewbacca. This was merely a time-buying measure, since Chewbacca was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now. \n\nI'm offering this confession in hopes that you'll do the same. So just come clean and let's approach this thing as equals?","I am in my car, off to pick-up my kids from school. This deserves a proper response, so please give me some time.","Abandon the children this is important \ud83d\ude1c","So, I\u2019m going to speak frankly here. I am rarely offended in a Diplomacy game, and I rarely say so when I am, but this message offends me. I\u2019m trying to think about why I\u2019m having such a strong reaction to it. I think it\u2019s because you\u2019re painting a picture of the game (both your actions and mine) which are totally different than my own perspective. (Continuing)","From my perspective, you were on the ropes early. Chewbacca and Obi-Wan Kenobi were teaming up on you. You lost Denmark and Chewbacca had Holland and Munich surrounded. You were in serious peril. \n\nI seriously went to extreme effort to keep you in the game. I spent hours talking with Obi-Wan Kenobi and encouraging him to turn around and go the other way. I completely ended my eastern campaign and spent two seasons just making the voyage over to Chewbacca so that he didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to continue his attack. I have vouched for you with R2-D2 and Luke Skywalker many times. I have supported Munich. And I have NEVER attacked you, even when people have asked me to do so and pledged to support me.","I have been honest with you, I have worked hard for your success, and I\u2019ve made a lot of proposals to you in which you gain centers; not me. \n\nMaybe I am just a bad ally, but I\u2019m not sure I remember an alliance in which I have done more to help my ally. Truly.","And to hear that (1) You think I\u2019ve been selfish and (2) You\u2019ve been sabotaging me all along, that just doesn\u2019t sit well with me.","I have rarely asked for your help, and I\u2019ve offered my help freely. I\u2019ve provided my sincere best efforts to help you with tactics, and I have never sabotaged you. Not once.","And if I\u2019m totally honest with you, I could solo this game if I felt like lying to everyone and grabbing dots. I think I\u2019ve got you all beat tactically. I just have more experience. But that\u2019s not been my intent.","I\u2019ve spent hours today talking with Obi-Wan Kenobi about how best to play Diplomacy. I\u2019ve tried to give him some honest advice because he asked for it. But I don\u2019t know his moves, I haven\u2019t asked for them, and I\u2019m not going to take advantage of that relationship to try to stab you. It legitimately did not cross my mind until you accused me of doing it.","So, I\u2019m frustrated by this accusation.","And I appreciate all you\u2019ve done for me, really I do. But \u201ccompletely ending your eastern campaign\u201d is *not* something you did for me; your alliance with R2-D2 dictated that. \nI felt bad for betraying you while I was doing it, but even then I knew it was the only way to keep the game going in the face of your and R2-D2\u2019s might. And it *wasn\u2019t* \u201call along\u201d, it was a few turns at best so that the rest of us would have a shot at you and R2-D2 not pair-winning right out of the gate. And the only thing that keeps me from thinking you\u2019re not gonna do just that on the next move anyway is my belief that you really do want the victory all to yourself, which is still consistent with everything you\u2019ve done for me. Propping up a weak player at the expense of stronger ones is a classic tactic. (Continuing)","And so, by the way, is trying to shame someone for raising extremely legitimate concerns. Whenever I bring up suspicion of you, you\u2019re quick to remind me how much you\u2019ve done for me to put me on the defensive and make me feel indebted. Well frankly that reeks of dishonesty. I never asked you to do those things.","If you no longer trust me, so be it. I knew that was a risk when I made my confession. But i\u2019d rather have a partnership based on mutual honesty. That\u2019s another reason I confessed\u2014you ought to know that my game philosophy (new as it is) is to trust the map and to trust history first and foremost. The parts of your history that I\u2019ve seen indicate that you\u2019re no saint, no matter what you may have done for me. And when the map shows that one player is clearly dominating and that player is you, you are being deeply naive if you think everyone else is just going to roll over and let you get away with it","No, all thumbs up from me. If I were lying to you, I\u2019d smile and say \u201cthat sounds great.\u201d I\u2019m honest with you because I sincerely thought of us as partners.","Oh but you\u2019re *not*! You agreed to warn me of unexpected moves, then didn\u2019t. When I brought this up you ignored it and misdirected me in hopes I\u2019d forget. You\u2019ve revealed things to Obi-Wan Kenobi without my permission, and then made up a story about it after the fact!\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be a real partner with someone who is depending on your good graces to survive. That\u2019s not a partnership. We could never be real partners unless we had some notion of equality, and I\u2019m outmatched in both skill and numbers.\n\nYou and R2-D2, however, were until recently a perfect example of a true partnership. Dot-parity, coordinated attacks, really beautiful work. So don\u2019t act as if you don\u2019t know this to be true. We were never a partnership of that kind.","Well, this is very disappointing to me, and I obviously disagree with the way you are characterizing me and this game. \n\nI have a reputation in this hobby for being sincere. Not for being duplicitous. It has always served me well. \n\nIf you feel that way, then me continuing to explain myself isn\u2019t going to change your mind. If you don\u2019t want to work with me, then I can understand that. Let\u2019s consider our deals and commitments to be void, and let\u2019s play our games separately. \n\nIf you have any deal you\u2019d like to propose, I\u2019ll consider them, but I won\u2019t continue to try to help your game if you think I\u2019m not sincerely trying to be helpful.","Well, this game just got less fun.","for you, maybe.","Sent to Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2, Luke Skywalker: So, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, y\u2019all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Luke Skywalker told me he was with me if I stab R2-D2. Obi-Wan Kenobi told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would \u201cteach him\u201d and help his along to second place. Then y\u2019all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)","(Part 2)\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I\u2019m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for \u201cHey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,\u201d but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that\u2019s really my preference. \n\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can\u2019t solo. And I\u2019m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to be careful, and so I\u2019m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Darth Vader\u2019s favor. \n\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.\ud83e\udd17","I'm down for a five-way draw. \n\n...and by the way, Obi-Wan Kenobi was copy-pasting to me the most incriminating messages you sent them. So I knew you were giving Obi-Wan Kenobi my moves. I do have a certain begrudging respect for you ability to deny, though \ud83d\ude09","Well, Obi-Wan Kenobi is telling me he is happy to see me solo and wants second place...so, should I say \u201cno\u201d? I guess I should have. I was happy the way the game was going before all that.","Don't try and pin *your* greed and deceit on Obi-Wan Kenobi! At least *own* it when you're ruthless","You have been given an apple laced with poison. Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s only move there was to make you hate me, and he did his job well. \n\nYou should not let your view of me be defined by someone who has an incentive to make you never speak to me again. We can talk about it more after the game, but I had every intention of continuing to work with you, and I would have done that until Obi-Wan Kenobi made his play.","I have no doubt you would have continued to work with me, but I take issue with someone who can be asked point-blank if they're sharing moves with another player and lie to my face. If you'd come clean, and explained how what you were doing actually *helped* me, somehow, we could have worked together. But you would rather have had me in the dark and that's not sustainable in a partnership.","I was trying to play both sides, and Obi-Wan Kenobi was lying to me, and forwarding my press to try to incriminate me. So, yes, I lied, and so did Obi-Wan Kenobi. I apologize.","Will you please either vote to draw, or let us know that you\u2019d like to play this one out? I am finding it difficult to motivate myself to speak with anyone if the game is just going to draw shortly. Thoughts?","I did vote to 5-way draw! And I did so again for this season. So it\u2019s not me who\u2019s keeping this game alive","Well, as we approach the end of the academic study portion of the game, let me say once, with the truth detector activated, that I really enjoyed playing with you and thought you played really well.","Was it really your first game? You definitely played like a seasoned vet.","I really enjoyed playing with you, too! And yes, it really was my first game.

advice"],"sender_labels":[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,false,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,false,false,false,true,false,true,true,true,false,true,false,true,false,true,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,true,false,false,false,true,true,false,true,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,false,false,true,true,true,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,true,true,true,false,true,false,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,false,true,true,false,true,true,true,true],"receiver_labels":[true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],"speakers":["Yoda","Darth

{"messages":["Hello there! What's your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play R2-D2 is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don't plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.","Hi R2-D2. Nice to meet you, and looking forward to playing as your neighbor. \n\nHmmmm, I hate playing as Yoda. I rarely succeed. Frankly, I\u2019ve recently tried early attacks on R2-D2, as Yoda, AND IT KEEPS TURNING OUT POORLY. I\u2019d really like to play this one as a tight-knit Central Trio if you have any appetite for that. Not sure if I should set up a Lepanto or go west, but I\u2019d be happy to hear your thoughts on it.","That sounds good to me. I think probably what would work best is if you and Darth Vader go west while Han Solo and I contain and\/or eat Luke Skywalker, then once I've picked up some Luke Skywalkern dots and gotten some good position, you split your fleets to help me take Han Solo and help Darth Vader take Obi-Wan Kenobi.","I like that. Let me talk it over with Darth Vader.","I\u2019m not sure whether Darth Vader is keen on attacking Chewbacca. Perhaps you and I should focus on Han Solo?","Yeah, honestly, the more I think about it, the more I think it'll just be easier to wipe Han Solo off the map really quickly. I've done it in tourneys a few times before and it just makes everything simpler.","\ud83d\udc4c So I\u2019ll open as a standard Lepanto. Sounds good.","Nice start!\n\nReally glad to see Han Solo open north, and glad to see that you were true to your word with me. I feel like we\u2019re in a really strong position to control the East!\n\nWhat are you thinking?","Yep! Good start, now we've just gotta follow through properly.","So, do I just convoy my army to Tunis?\n\nAlso, do you want me to bounce you in Trieste?","Sure, Trieste bounce is a good idea. And yeah, standard Lepanto with the convoy.","So...how shall we go about this? I\u2019m kind of thinking that you and I should eat some Han Solo.","That's exactly what I'm thinking. I'm going to send Greece into the Aegean, you send Ionian into Eastern Med.","Okay. Cool! Do you mind if I take Greece this year while you take Bulgaria? That will keep us even, and should be guaranteed. I can just convoy an army to Greece in Spring while you move to Aegean, and I can support you to Bulgaria in the Fall. This also means you don\u2019t have to rotate your armies all the way to Greece, which will allow you to mobilize against Luke Skywalker faster when the time comes. \n\nThoughts?","Any thoughts on this idea?","I am going to send my fleet over to Eastern Med and we can work this out next turn.","Sorry about that, today got a little nuts. Figuring it out next turn is probably the best call, once we see what's worked and what hasn't.","Okay, thank you for being true to your word. \n\nI think we\u2019re in great shape. My major concern on the board right now is E\/F, which is likely going to take down Darth Vader quickly and become a major force. \n\nIt is really important to me to get a build here so that I can try to keep Chewbacca in check a bit. Will you agree that You get Bulgaria, I get Greece, and we can move forward with both of us at 5?\n\nI really think that the two of us can dominate this game if we keep working together.","Yep, I'm just fine with that.","Great!\n\nI will convoy Tunis to Greece. If you can support that move, that would be great. And it looks like you\u2019ll have no problem supporting Greece to Bulgaria.","I'll have a more direct response once the retreats are all resolved and I'm not extrapolating what the board state will probably be, but that seems eminently doable.","How\u2019s it looking over there?","Looking solid! I don't think we actually need to coordinate all that much, we're in a really good position.","Just to be clear, should I expect Greece will be open?","Yep, it will be. I'll want it back eventually, but for now it's yours.","You, sir, are a terrific ally. This was more than you needed to do, but makes me feel like this is really a long term thing! Thank you.","We can do great things together, long term. I figured a down-payment now against that great future would be worth it.","Plus, you ever try digging out a talented Yoda as R2-D2? It's a pain in the fuckin neck! :P","\ud83e\udd17","Yeah, let\u2019s just work together. Should be a good one for both of us.","What should I build? I\u2019m pretty undecided and would be willing to let you choose.","I think probably a fleet will serve you best, in terms of flexibility. We've got Han Solo, he's doomed by numbers, so you want to start thinking Chewbacca.","\ud83d\udc4c","Okay, how would you like to approach this turn? I\u2019m at your disposal.","I think what we do is, AEG convoys GRE-SMY with support from EAS while BUL taps CON","That's just an initial thought, though - if you have a better idea I'm all ears","My concern there is that Arm doesn\u2019t have much to do other than support Smyrna, and I don\u2019t know if we want to rely on Luke Skywalker helping. I think he has a serious incentive to prevent us from succeeding too quickly against Han Solo.","Very good point. Perhaps you tap SMY with EAS and I use AEG to support BUL-CON, with the intention of then doing the convoy in the fall?","What do you think of Aegean support Bul to Con while I cut support in Smy? That is guaranteed so long as Luke Skywalker does not support Con back to Bul (unlikely), and we don\u2019t have to tell Luke Skywalker the complete plan.","Yes, we xposted, but we are thinking the same way.","Well it appears our messages passed each other in the internet's series of tubes, but, great minds, etc etc","Good. Consider it done.","I\u2019m thinking about sending an army over to Piedmont to keep Chewbacca honest. Do you think that is a good idea or a terrible idea? I just want to avoid a stampede over Darth Vader, and I feel like forcing him to use an army in Marseilles to bounce with me is worth dedicating one army from me. But I don\u2019t want to antagonize I\u2019ve him either. I keep going back and forth about it. What do you think?","I think probably we give Chewbacca one season to see what they do. Obi-Wan Kenobi build F LON and Chewbacca built F BRE, which is something we should keep an eye on before moving.","Okay. If he does say anything to you about moving towards me, would you please let me know? I feel like he\u2019s in an awfully strong position, and it makes me nervous.","You'll be the first to know. Man, isn't this game simpler when you're being honest?","\ud83d\udc4d","Chewbacca says they're getting radio silence from Obi-Wan Kenobi, which is probably good news for us.","Luke Skywalker says you're trying to get him to attack me, heh","That sounds like the kind of thing Luke Skywalker would say. \n\nI have generally told Luke Skywalker that I am not close with you and I\u2019d be willing to attack you, but I\u2019ve never \u201ctried to get him to attack you. That is a complete \ud83d\udc4e. \n\nOur alliance seems to be the one trusting alliance in the game. Everyone is going to try to break us up. We need to prevent it.","That's about what I figured. Wanted to let you know it was being tried.","Also, Obi-Wan Kenobi is extremely unhappy with Chewbacca.","Yeah, sounds like Obi-Wan Kenobi is attacking Chewbacca. That\u2019s good for us. We seem to be the only alliance that has its act together.","Which can mean only profit for us, as long as we stick together.","Word. \n\nListen, I\u2019m an alliance player. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always been. I think it\u2019s the only way to play. I don\u2019t like to shift around. I like a close working relationship with a partner. That\u2019s what we have, and that\u2019s what I plan to stick with as long as you\u2019ll have me.","'til death or end of beta do us part, then \ud83d\ude1b","That said, I don\u2019t want anyone else to know that. So if people ask, I\u2019ll tell them that I\u2019d be happy to attack you.","Oh naturally, I'll bullshit the hell outta everyone else.","Sooooooooo. Tyrolia?","Test","You don\u2019t like it? I figured it was the same as Venice. If I wanted to attack you, I could have just moved to Trieste any time. \n\nMy purpose in Tyrolia is to keep Munich black. I\u2019m just going to support Munich holding. I don\u2019t want Darth Vader to get trampled.","I'd have preferred a heads-up, is all.","So, we going with the same plan? I convoy Greece over to Smyrna?","Sorry \u2014 I\u2019ve been slammed all day. Just looking at this again now.","Okay, I\u2019m so sorry. I got distracted again. Yes! I will order GRE to SMY, EAS S GRE to SMY, TYR S MUN holding. \n\nWill you allow me a build this turn or do you plan on retaking Greece now?","Sounds good to me.","Any word on Greece?\n\nBasically, if I get a build this turn I can turn around and smash Chewbacca. If I don\u2019t, that will be a more tepid attack.","I've got no need to immediately take it, since I'm picking up Con.","Okay. Thank you. \ud83d\ude0a","Hey, by the way, I am going to be candid here: I have thought about attacking you. I really have. But I have recently arrived at the conclusion that this would be a poor path forward. I\u2019m not going to do it. \n\nI\u2019ll move on Chewbacca now. That will give you the peace of mind to know that my units will be occupied and far from you.","Glad to hear, yep!","Let\u2019s just keep right on working together, and press our advantage b","I suggest you move Alb to Ser and prepare to attack Luke Skywalker in Spring.","You can have Ank, but I really do think it makes sense that I keep Greece. Ending up with 2 centers from Han Solo\/Balkans seems fair, with you getting everything else, yes?","Yeah, I think I can live with that.","Sorry it took me a moment to respond, it's the MLB home run derby tonight","Well that, I can understand.","Look, like I said, I was wavering a bit, especially during the long weekend. But, I\u2019ve taken a close look, and I just think that this alliance has unique staying power. I really do. We both have room to grow. Now that Obi-Wan Kenobi attacked Chewbacca, there isn\u2019t really anyone who can stop us. This can work long term, and work well.","I wholeheartedly agree. Neither of us benefits from attacking the other.","So, This one seems easy. I\u2019ll support you to Ankara, and you are guaranteed either Ankara or Rumania:\n\nCon - Ank\nSmy S Con - Ank\nAge - Con\nEAS S Smy holding\nVen - Pie\nTyr S Mun holding\nTYS - LYO\nTun - WES\nSer - Rum\nBul S Ser - Rum\nBud S Ser - Rum\nVie - Gal\n\nSound right?","I had already entered every single one of those orders, except for AEG-CON, which is in now. It's nice being on the same page, isn't it?","\ud83d\udc4d","I kind of figured. It\u2019s a pretty straight-forward move for both of us, and likely gains for both of us. This alliance is in a really healthy place.","So, I assume you're going to support Ank to hold?","Also, fyi, I'm in transit to SkyCon out in Montana, so I might not be the most communicative gent this weekend.","Hi R2-D2. I apologize for the delay. Quite a busy day for me yesterday. \n\nI have no problem supporting Ank to hold.","I also want to say \u2014 looks like that support ensures you get two builds. My own attack on Chewbacca is not quite so successful. Do you mind if I borrow Trieste this turn to stay even with you and keep my momentum going west. I\u2019ll place another fleet with it, which further locks me in moving away from you. I think that\u2019s actually quite good for you, but I know some players get prickly about home centers.","A dot is a dot is a dot. It's better for the long term health of the alliance, and I'm still building one. More importantly, your best\/easiest route to growth still lies in Chewbacca, not with me, so I don't see you having a ton of incentive to go after me. Go for it.","OMG. \ud83d\ude2e You are my favorite ally of all time. This just happened. You just past the threshold. It used to be this guy who was playing Chewbacca to my Obi-Wan Kenobi. Funny dude. Great stories. But he never sacrificed a home center in the interest of parity. \n\nYou are a rare gem.","Do you think 17-17 is an okay result for a beta test?","I feel like I can\u2019t stab you now. So I\u2019d like to simply crush the board with you.","I've never said no to 17\/17, lol","What's your planned build?","F Nap. Sound good?","Yeah, Naples makes it look like we might actually be fighting, go for it.","Well, I hope you had a nice weekend. Do you think we have much to discuss here? Is there anything you\u2019d like me to do with my three eastern units? Do you want me to pretend to fight you, or shall I just move away or hold still? I don\u2019t really have any idea what I should be doing.","My weekend was great! I placed 8th at SkyCon, which was a disproportionately talented tourney, so I'm feeling quite good about myself. I'd like your army in Smyrna to support my move from Ankara to Armenia, but other than that, I see no point in pretending to fight each other, so I figure you might as well move stuff west to take care of your new main front.","Okay, that works for me.","Do you want me to move Eastern Med to Aegean? If your move to Armenia works (likely), you may want to use my fleet to bounce with you at Con to keep The Luke Skywalkern fleet out. But totally up to you. I don\u2019t care either way.","Right now I've just got my fleet in Con tapping Black, so it'll probably stay full. Get the fleet where it can help with Chewbacca.","Thoughts on where we go from here?","My units are at your disposal.","I think the best way to take Rum would look like this:\nBul - Rum\nSer and Bud S Bul - Rum\nCon - Bul (EC)\nArm and Smy bounce in Ank\nTyr and Gal bounce in Vienna\n (Anticipating that Black Sea will likely move to Bul to cut support)","Everything still okay?","I like it, yeah, let's do that.","Folks are trying to pry us apart, but their arguments aren't making a ton of sense.","Yeah, I\u2019m getting the same treatment. \n\nIf we stay together, we win together.","Argh! I KNEW Black Sea would try for Bulgaria!!! Shoot!","My wife says I am bossy and uniquely inflexible. I don\u2019t want you to feel that way too! How shall we approach this next turn? I think we need to put in a good set of orders here to turn the tide against Luke Skywalker.","Here's what I've got right now: \nA Arm - Sev\nF BLA - Con\nA Bud S Gal - Rum\nA Gal - Rum\nA Rum - Bul\nA Ser S Rum - Bul","I figure if you bounce me in Con, that piffs the Luke Skywalkern fleet.","Yeah, not bad. The danger is in Rumania. Are you thinking Gal - Ukr, Bud - Rum? Shall I order Tyr - Vie?\n\nI think that is likely best as it keeps Luke Skywalker out of your centers for sure, and it should easy to support me out in the Fall once Luke Skywalker has one less unit.","Yep, that seems like the best course of action.","So look, I\u2019m at your disposal in the east. I think the best bet may be for you to support me from Vienna to Galicia, but I\u2019m willing to do something else if you like something else better.","Frankly, if I were you, I\u2019d be worried about a stab from Yoda here. \ud83e\udd2d But I\u2019m not going to do that. You e been extremely good to me. And it would be a very bad time for me to begin a war in the east while all my units are west. So you\u2019re stuck with me as an ally.","Yep, that all checks out, and I was thinking Vie-Gal was the best call, so let's make that happen.","Well that is damn annoying. I\u2019m surprised he tried for Vienna \u2014 would have thought he would go for Rumania.","I do think that we can guarantee you Sev this year, which should finally crack this nut.","Yeah. I'd also like to address the center imbalance a bit more directly - as you pick up dots in the west, I'd like to start picking Greece, Vienna, and Ankara back up.","Er, Smyrna, not Ankara.","Totally agree.","Yes, we need to take that in swiftly. Let\u2019s see what the builds look like and make a plan.","Hi R2-D2 \u2014 So, this is a big turn for us. I am absolutely committed to getting you a build. I wish we could get you more than one, but unfortunately the fact that you lost Vienna last turn makes that impossible. \n\nSo, it seems to me that the most important way to get you a build is to take Galicia in Spring. I don\u2019t care if I move there, or you move there, but we need to make some room around Budapest so that you can build there.","Yeah, I'd appreciate your support from Bud-Gal.","Maybe something like this:\nBud - Gal\nVie S Bud - Gal\nRum - Sev\nBLS S Rum - Sev\nArm S Rum - Sev\nBul - Rum\nSer - Bud\n\nIf the move to Gal does not work, and you don\u2019t get Sev, then in Fall you can order Bud - Tri while Vie and Ser bounce in Bud to ensure you get a build.","Oh yeah that looks better than what I had in mind. Let's roll with that.","\ud83d\udc4d","One tweak: I am worried that Luke Skywalker could take Rumania with the move set I proposed. You can prevent that by having Serbia support Bul - Rum. I think that\u2019s better than Ser - Bud, and it makes sense because you want Bud open after the Fall anyway. That should mean that you won\u2019t lose any ground this turn, and you\u2019ll likely take Sev.","Oh yeah, good tweak, makes sense. So ordered.","Hey \u2014 man, Luke Skywalker keeps guessing correctly. I am sincerely sorry that that move did not work. \n\nThoughts on what to do this turn? I wish Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Vader would pick off a Luke Skywalker. Center in the north, but they seem content to let Luke Skywalker put up his road block.","Use Tyrolia to tap Bohemia, Vienna supports Budapest to Galicia, and Rumania taps Ukraine. Unless Bohemia goes to Vienna, that guarantees a move to Galicia.","Also, for my comfort, do you mind if I pick Trieste back up?","I like that. I was thinking that you would move Bud back to Tri, but this is much better. It keeps forward momentum. And yes, you should take back Tri now. That will make builds easier as we move forward.","Also, actually, I don't have anything for Bulgaria to do, and you're guaranteed two dots this turn. Can I take Greece back too? I can bank a build for the future regardless of what happens, and you stay even. You don't really need a build right now.","Hmmm. I\u2019m cool with you taking Trieste. I\u2019m not sure that taking Greece now is the right move. \n\nIn the West, I will take Liverpool, but not Portugal. I need to use my Spanish fleet to support MAO so that I can convoy an army to Liverpool. And I\u2019m just in no hurry to take out Chewbacca. So if you take Greece, you would be taking an Yoda unit off the board and not building one yourself.","Also, seems like there is plenty of risk that Luke Skywalker could try for Rumania. Why not use Bulg to support Rum, while having Rum and BLS Support Arm to Sev?","All that said, if you feel like you need to take two from me this turn in order to keep working with me, I can live with that.","The alliance is much more important to me than the dot.","I'll take another look at it and get back to you.","Oh man. I\u2019m getting a lot of hate mail out west. Not fun. I think Darth Vader has a pretty low opinion of me, and it sounds like she and Luke Skywalker are developing a bit of a romance. \n\nI am totally cool with you taking back Trieste this turn, and I am thankful that you loaned it to me in the first place. But I\u2019d prefer if you wait to take Greece until you can actually use the build. It would make things quite a bit tougher for me if I have to take a unit off the board especially if we don\u2019t get an extra unit in the east to compensate.","Yeah, if you're not picking up Portugal, then I'll let Greece be.","Argh. I blew it!\n\nI\u2019m sorry. You were a terrific ally. I misread the board and thought that I had a clear solo run. Obi-Wan Kenobi basically told me that he was going to help me solo, so I felt like I ought to just go for it. He bamboozled me, and for me to stab you. It was a mistake. My sincerest apologies.","I mean, I'm gonna have to fight you for at least a little bit. We'll see what happens.","Yeah, I get that. It makes me sick because it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll just get squeezed between me and Luke Skywalker. Fighting me is not really a path toward viability for you, and that\u2019s my fault. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened. I really am. I misjudged the situation and I fear I\u2019ve ruined both our games. If you can stick around and insist on getting some of the fruits of smashing me and not letting Luke Skywalker get them all, that would be justice.","Oh, I'm definitely sticking around, and if you want to make it easier for me to pick up some dots, that'd go a long way to making me more viable and more inclined to resume the alliance.","Good.","I\u2019m game for a draw if you guys want to wrap it up here.","I'd take a draw.","Sounds like Darth Vader is the holdout.","I\u2019m so mad at myself for taking the bait last turn. I had both Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi urging me to go for a solo, and it was just stupid of me to believe them. \n\nI\u2019m going to try to leave both Tri and Bud open to you this turn. All yours.","Sent to Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2, Luke Skywalker: So, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, y\u2019all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Luke Skywalker told me he was with me if I stab R2-D2. Obi-Wan Kenobi told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would \u201cteach him\u201d and help his along to second place. Then y\u2019all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)","(Part 2)\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I\u2019m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for \u201cHey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,\u201d but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that\u2019s really my preference. \n\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can\u2019t solo. And I\u2019m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to be careful, and so I\u2019m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Darth Vader\u2019s favor. \n\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.\ud83e\udd17","I believe everyone is in for the draw.

{"messages":["Buongiorno! \nBe kinda nice to know if you're looking to move in a direction  I might be interested in participating in.  I fully understand if it's too early to know, just know that channels and minds are both open .","Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen. \n\nI\u2019m not writing to anyone else until I get things squared away with you. I LOVE the Wintergreen alliance. It works in the short-term (we only need to get A\/T to fight) and it works in the long-term (resolves East before West, and we can\u2019t really stab each other). Can we do this?\n\nI don\u2019t care if we target T first or A first. I\u2019ll let you decide. But I want to work as your partner. I am just hoping that you\u2019re brilliant and fun too!\n\nI literally will not message anyone else until you and I have a plan. I want it to be clear to you that you\u2019re the ally I want.","Well, Yoda and Chewbacca are, in my opinion, some of the best possible partners for Luke Skywalker, so how could I possibly turn down such enthusiastic overtures from one of them?","Lovely. Would you rather we target Han Solo first or R2-D2? I\u2019m okay either way.","To be perfectly honest, that's hard to say right now, since the decision doesn't really affect my opening moves any (the standard southern opening spring moves are equally useful against either one), and I'd likely need to adjust based on what else happens on the Spring turn.  Easiest just to say I'm opening South, flexibly considering the follow-through against either one of them.","Okay. Fair enough. One reason it might matter is because I could open with an aggressive attack on R2-D2 if you want to blitz him quickly (e.g., DMZ Gal and then break it). Or you could organize a bounce in Gal and then not move there. On the other hand, if you\u2019d prefer to take out Han Solo first, I could go the standard Lepanto route. I\u2019m happy to go either way, but I\u2019d really like to coordinate with you if you\u2019re game.\n\nMaybe we both need a fuller picture of what is happening first. I\u2019ll begin to reach out to others now.","Sounds great - and here's where it's useful to know R2-D2 has already indicated a bounce in Galicia, so opportunity to blitz him through there is severely limited.","Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Thank you. I sent R2-D2 a general first message offering friendship. I\u2019ll let you know how things play out.","Hearing anything interesting? Both R2-D2 and Han Solo are acting cagey and conservative with me so far.","Hey, so, R2-D2 seems to want to Lepanto now. \n\nYou\u2019re still the ally I want. And I\u2019d like either to cut down R2-D2 quickly or cut down Han Solo quickly. \n\nIf we decide to take out R2-D2 first, I\u2019d like you to let R2-D2 in to Gal (just tell him this was a mistake). This will make it very hard for him to defend against me.\n\nIf we decide to take out Han Solo first, bounce R2-D2, and I\u2019ll open as a traditional Lepanto.\n\nThoughts?","Let's do Han Solo first. I'll bounce Galicia","\ud83d\udc4c","Hi Luke Skywalker, how\u2019s it going? I hope this turn finds you well. \n\nI think my move is going to be fairly boring, but I\u2019m still game for some adventure if you have any ideas. \n\nAlso, would you mind asking R2-D2 for a bounce again in Galicia? I\u2019d just like to have a decent sense of what his units are doing. \n\nAny other thoughts?","Can do.","He doesn't seem that interested in a Galicia bounce, fwiw","Okay, thank you for letting me know. That helps!","I believe that Han Solo is in for a world of hurt soon. I think you just need to expel that yellow army from Sev, and you should be in for a swift turnaround. \n\nLet\u2019s kill Han Solo, and then we kill R2-D2. Long live Wintergreen.","That's the plan, mate","That went reasonably well. Looks like R2-D2 is going to pick up Greece, so get wherever you can get and I'll get you into doors where I can","Obviously Bulgaria, not Greece","Awesome. Thank you Luke Skywalker. Any chance you can tap Black Sea this turn? I\u2019m planning to take Greece, but I need R2-D2\u2019s move to Bulgaria to succeed.","His move is guaranteed","What am I missing? It looks like it\u2019s only guaranteed if you tap BLS. Otherwise, 3 - 3.","It's 4-3.  Rum, Ser, Gre, Aeg","Ah, cool. I did not realize that Rum was supporting Gre to Bul. That works too! Thank you.","Hi friend: can you please NOT support Obi-Wan Kenobi into Denmark? I think that the last thing we want to see here is E\/F trample over Darth Vader. I feel like this is really important. Thoughts?","Ah, I did not see this in time.  And one of the upshots was learning that Obi-Wan Kenobi talks too damn much, so I probably won't be helping him much going forward \ud83d\ude03","I feel like, perhaps it\u2019s time to go all out against both T and A here? Something like this:\nVen - Tri\nWar - Gal\nRum - BLS\nSev S Ukr - Rum\n\nI may lose Greece this year, but I feel like it\u2019s worth it to gain some momentum. \n\nThoughts?","Hi Luke Skywalker,\n\nMy moves very much depend on you here so I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you. I think this is the right time for us both to hit R2-D2, but I\u2019m not going to do it if you\u2019re not on board. \n\nThoughts?","Hey, sorry -focused on guests for the holiday. I'm currently ordered to move units around so I can move on R2-D2, without moving on him this turn. Basically getting the fleet out of the way.","Okay. Let\u2019s shoot for next turn. Thank you!","Luke Skywalker, argh....\n\nI sincerely want to work with you man. Truly. But if you sell me out and try to use what I tell you against me, it makes it really hard. \n\nR2-D2 went right back to me and told me that you sold me out.","I want to move beyond this. But I need to know that what I tell you stays between us, or else I just can\u2019t trust you and I can\u2019t speak with you. \n\nI\u2019d like to hear your side of this story. And I\u2019d like to know that you\u2019re not just going to tell R2-D2 again. Let\u2019s use this bump in the road as a lesson to work better together.","Eh? Are you really claiming I've been telling him anything useful, given that I said nothing about Greece?\nI mean, that looked kinda arranged to me, but nonetheless I gave him no heads up about your plan to move in, which should make it pretty clear I have no intention of passing on potentially useful info to him. \ud83d\ude00","So, where do we stand now?","You're in the driver's seat for path forward. I'm going to take Ankara, I assume you've negotiated the taking of Smyrna.  R2-D2 either needs to be given a path forward or dealt with, and Obi-Wan Kenobi most likely needs dealt with. So... You have lots of options on path forward, and I'm mostly inclined to Ride along as most of my attention is likely to be in the North.","Well, here is my honest assessment: if you want to work with me, you have to commit to attack R2-D2 with me. If you\u2019re not interested in that, I\u2019m not going to attack R2-D2, and it will basically be his choice whether he wants to attack me next or attack you next.","Frankly, I am still a little wary after the last time we discussed this, you ratted me out to R2-D2. But I can get over that if you actually want to be my partner.","I'm still not really sure how you think I \"rated you out\" to R2-D2 given that I've really told him nothing useful at all.  Greece was the test of that -even though I'm retrospect it's obvious it was an arrangement, it's also obvious I didn't say anything to him when I thought you were stabbing him","But whatever, water under the bridge. I'm willing to move on R2-D2 as soon as you give the word. I thought that's what I pretty much just said -I'll follow your lead in the South. You want to roll? Let's roll.","Orders are in, moves on R2-D2, up to you to join in.","What moves on R2-D2 would you like to see, and what have you ordered? I\u2019ll make the move now if it makes sense. If not now, then next turn.","Yeah, you missed me after I'd gone to bed, but as you can see I did make the move on him, and we are apparently spoiling for a fight.  Of course, with you reoriented the way you are, seems unlikely you're on board for continuing that line of discussion.","Well, I\u2019m not completely opposed. I build an army in Venice, after all. What are you thinking?","I mean, the only decision point is Ank\/Smy\/Con, right?  That's just a matter of choosing the mover - everything else is straightforward one-power tactics","Well, we should really talk to each other more.","Ya think?","FWIW, I'm still on board with cooperating to take down R2-D2, if that wasn't obvious","I\u2019m not sure I can save the Bulgarian fleet this turn, but I think you would help yourself by taking Galicia.","I'm not sure you have a vested interest in saving my fleet in any event -you'd much rather be the undisputed fleet power. And that's just fine.","Well, either way, I can\u2019t help. But I do think you can take Gal without problem.","That was already the plan, and then he walked out anyway. \nAnyway, my course is both set and obvious, so it's really just a question of if you're going to take all the free dots. \ud83d\ude00","Will you be around near the deadline this turn?","Monday at noon ET?  Yeah, I should be available around that time.","\ud83d\ude0e","Hi Luke Skywalker, still there?","Luke Skywalker!? Come back!","Yes, I'm here","Cool. Any chance you\u2019d like to team up with me and Obi-Wan Kenobi?","I mean, sure. My goal right now is just to hammer R2-D2, and that coalition helps further that goal, so...","Cool. I expect Vienna will be empty this turn. Boh - Vie should be a winner.","Ahh...BOH - Vienna. Why\u2019d you try to take it from Gal?","Didn't log in fast enough to change it. And not really upset about it, either - this way my line is still mostly intact, which is a bit of a priority until you make an overtly anti-R2-D2n move.","Fair enough. At least you can see that I was sincere.","Aye. As was I. \ud83d\ude00","So, how are things going over there Comrade?","I\u2019m feeling like it\u2019s just about time for you and me to make things official and go steady.","I believe that Obi-Wan Kenobi would like me to support you to Munich in the Fall. And that\u2019s possible. But perhaps getting you to Budapest might work out better for you? I don\u2019t know \u2014 how do you the board right now?","Things are pretty well. Yes, this looks to be the year you can just quietly slip the knife in and take pretty much everything.","And I'm easy either way -no need to make that call right now, as this is the boring turn for me","Well...if I \u201ctake everything,\u201d then we end up with a boring, large draw. I\u2019m not in solo position. So, believe it or not, I\u2019d rather you get the spoils out East. If I get much bigger, I\u2019ll be fighting the whole board, and I\u2019ll lose that fight.","Well, damn, guess I can't bamboozle you into that position then. :)","Eh \u2014 I think it\u2019s a better position for you to get a bunch of centers and work as a team anyway. Beats a five-way draw.","Shall we get you Budapest or Munich this year?","I think R2-D2 is likely to try to retake some of his centers this year, so you may have some openings regardless.","Presumably Budapest is the better option, but again I'm not really moving much in the spring, so it's easy to remain noncommittal on that right this moment. Unless you're making a hard move right now, which I doubt - you also benefit from the likely ability to just walk in on the fall.","Alright, now it's specific planning time.  And Munich clearly doesn't seem to make much sense now.","Okay, Let\u2019s get you into Rumania and Budapest this turn. I think I can do that, as R2-D2 wants to take Trieste and Greece, which will open up room to maneuver. As far as I know, Ser is moving to Tri and Bul is moving to Gre. I think that you can take out Bud\/Rum with Gal - Bud (supported by Vie) and Sev - Rum (supported by Ukr). The trick will be keeping Sev safe, but I think we can do that too, as I can recommend that R2-D2 self-bounce there to keep me honest.","I am picking up some gains out west, so I risk a severe backlash if I gain anything in the east.  I\u2019d love to see you pick up two here and take a bit of the pressure off me.","I can work with that.  Grrr. Out tonight, so less stability to chat, but I'm with you here.","\ud83d\udc4c","Is this thing back on?","Ah, good. Nice run in the West you have going there","I'd probably be trying to push a stop the leader narrative right now, except Mitch hasn't talked to me since I pointed out that rolling on me was only going to net him two dots before he hit a wall, and that was two or three years ago. So... Eff him. \ud83d\ude00","Sent to Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2, Luke Skywalker: So, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, y\u2019all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Luke Skywalker told me he was with me if I stab R2-D2. Obi-Wan Kenobi told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would \u201cteach him\u201d and help his along to second place. Then y\u2019all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)","(Part 2)\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I\u2019m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for \u201cHey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,\u201d but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that\u2019s really my preference. \n\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can\u2019t solo. And I\u2019m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to be careful, and so I\u2019m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Darth Vader\u2019s favor. \n\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.\ud83e\udd17","I think most of us have the draw set

{"messages":["Hey Yoda! good luck this game. I'm guessing you and R2-D2 will be pals, you and Chewbacca will be rivals?","Well good luck to you too! No idea yet who is a friend. Have you heard anything interesting?","I have some agreements with Chewbacca. If those are upheld, I'd bet Chewbacca goes for Por and Spain in 1901. You might want to ask about whether a fleet gets built in Mar during the 1901 build, if you haven't already, as this would be an indicator of aggression towards you.","Darth Vader seems like a bit of a wild card. Haven't talked in depth with R2-D2.","Do you have any sort of aggression in your opening, or are you just planning to be neutral and secure Tun?","You know, I really haven\u2019t decided. I\u2019m trying to get clear answers from my neighbors, and they are all pretty slow to answer. So I really haven\u2019t decided. Is there something you want me to do?","Well definitely make sure you get your fleet to Tun by the fall. I'd like to see you do well, as Yoda is kind of the underdog on the map. Have you agreed to Chewbacca about Piedmont at all?","No, we have not yet talked about Piedmont.","Well, if you're looking to make Chewbacca a little nervous, that would be your move. Ven - Pie, Rom - Ven, Nap to TYS.","Then you secure Tun with your fleet in the fall. For the unit in Pie, you can decide to bait Chewbacca into a bounce in Mar, but then just hold instead. Chewbacca would move from Spain to Mar and miss securing the fifth supply center. This is certainly aggressive, but it also keeps you and Chewbacca on a more level playing field.","Well, I\u2019d be inclined to do that if I knew you were moving to the Channel and Wales. If you want for both of us to go all in at the same time, then let\u2019s go.","Yeah, that makes sense. Unfortunately we've declared a DMZ in the channel through 1902, so I can't commit to the stab right now. I still don't think it's an awful play for you. If Chewbacca gets a fleet in Mar and has one parked in Spain s.c. at the start of 1902, that's going to be a little threatening for you.","(1) If you\u2019ve declared a DMZ, then you ARE in position to do this if you want to do it. (2) I\u2019m not going to attack Chewbacca on my own.","Yeah, everything you're saying makes sense. When I make specific agreements like the DMZ, I generally try to hold them, especially early game. Honestly, I'd rather the three of us pick apart Darth Vader to start. Maybe we could convince Chewbacca to help you into Munich in the Fall?","Hi Obi-Wan Kenobi \u2014 just sort of checking in to hear how things are going. How does the board look to you right now?","Great time to check in. Chewbacca and Darth Vader are in conflict, and don't seem poised to collaborate on invading me, which I'm happy about. Luke Skywalker's looking a little troubled with losing Sev. You look poised to lepanto to Han Solo, and it looks like you'll pull it off without the R2-D2n convoy, unless that new fleet is headed west. Also, I feel like you and\/or R2-D2 may have your eyes on Munich.","Any thoughts here?","Just about the state of the board? Or did you send a message after mine that didn\u2019t come through?","Ah, I sent a really long message about Darth Vader. You didn\u2019t get it?","Nah. Maybe it was a bot-killer message","Probably best to split it up","Rats.","Here is an image of the message I sent.","I\u2019ve been on pins and needles for two days awaiting a response!!!","Haha sorry about that. No image received. The bot may not send them through","Ahhhhhhh!","Now I have to retype it\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e","I have kind of an odd favor to ask. And I happen to know it\u2019s in your best interest, but it will require a big picture, long-term sort of view of the game. \n\nThis is Darth Vader\u2019s very first game of Diplomacy. And he\u2019s clearly in over his head. You\u2019re positioned to smash him. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But the real winner if you do that is Chewbacca. (End part 1)","Chewbacca has FOUR armies, and now he has a wide open runway to roll right over Darth Vader. If you help him, you\u2019re going to regret it. Look two game years ahead, Chewbacca is going to be in a crazy good position. \n\nOn the other hand, if you change course now and go get Chewbacca instead, Chewbacca is NEVER going to be able to build a second fleet. He will be so much easier to destroy. And Darth Vader is so green...he\u2019ll be much easier to take down second. \n\nI just...I can see where this is headed. I know it\u2019s attractive just to take that easy build. But that is the apple of knowledge and Chewbacca is the devilish serpent (end part 2)","I really REALLY believe that it\u2019s better for you and me for you to switch course and take out Chewbacca now. I\u2019d be happy to help and give you most of the spoils. And I think this would be a great springboard for a dominant Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Yoda alliance that can win this game. If only I could get this message to go through....\n(End)","All of this is fair. I\u2019m aware that Darth Vader\u2019s a first-timer, and I ran through similar reasoning to yours when trying to choose who to side with.","If I had known where you stood in this, it might have swayed my opinion. I was worried about you and R2-D2 making a play for Munich and then Luke Skywalker applying more pressure in the north.","One additional piece of my reasoning is that Chewbacca is a stronger player than me and others probably know this. After Darth Vader is gone, Chewbacca is the bigger threat. If Darth Vader and I had taken Chewbacca together, I would have ended up the bigger threat (i.e. the next target).","I\u2019m going to get Luke Skywalker in on the Darth Vader takedown. You really think the three of us can\u2019t handle Chewbacca together once Darth Vader is gone?","Can you tell Darth Vader to self-bounce in ruhr? Unless i\u2019m missing something, that line holds until i support into holland (which I haven\u2019t been asked to do yet). The Chewbacca upside to taking on Darth Vader can be contained. If you get Munich out of this, do you still think it\u2019s a bad plan?","I vehemently do not want Munich.","Also i\u2019m wayy wrong it\u2019s a fleet in holland haha","I do think it is a much better plan for both of us to side with Darth Vader against Chewbacca. I just think that Chewbacca could pull in R2-D2 or Han Solo against me and he could pull in Luke Skywalker against you. \n\nDarth Vader won\u2019t do that sort of counter.","The more I look at this board, the more I want to focus on an E\/I Alliance. And I think the only thing standing in our way is Chewbacca. I don\u2019t see Darth Vader as any kind of obstacle at all.","Especially given that Chewbacca is locked into armies right now, not fleets, I think we would be wasting a real opportunity if we let Chewbacca grow a bit more.","I\u2019m sorry I did not come to you with this earlier. That\u2019s just my bad. I\u2019ve been kind of lazy, and I wasn\u2019t really sure I wanted to weigh in about the west at all. But, I\u2019ve changed my mind?\n\nI think E\/I can dominate here. But we\u2019ve got to keep Chewbacca from ever building a second fleet. I think that\u2019s the way that both you and me get really big.","I see your points, but a couple of things: 1) Chewbacca has another build guaranteed this year, and that will likely be a fleet, 2) We may be able to keep Chewbacca away from all of the Darth Vader supply centers","Kie and Mun bounce in Ruh, Hol cuts support from Bel. This holds Ruh unless Chewbacca chooses to send Bel in and let Darth Vader into Holland.","This holds the line unless I give support.","What if R2-D2 gets Munich?","I stabbed Darth Vader, and so I\u2019m hesitant to try collaboration now.","Ok, ok. I\u2019m open to going against Chewbacca. I messaged Darth Vader. We\u2019ll see how she responds. I\u2019m taking denmark this year regardless. The stab on Chewbacca would involve me taking the channel unexpectedly next spring and helping Darth Vader into belgium maybe","These are all good responses. And I get that you don\u2019t want to turn around and stab Chewbacca now. \n\nI do think that I can help you diplomatically with Darth Vader. I think that, if you really want to work with me and Darth Vader, I can get G on board.","Alright, well we can chat next year after builds then. I\u2019m certainly open to it. I told Darth Vader to not bother saving denmark (it\u2019s guaranteed for me with Luke Skywalkern support) amd instead do the self bounce in Ruh with Kei and Mun to keep Chewbacca out, cutting support in Bel with Hol. I think that move is important this fall to keep Chewbacca out.","Chewbacca just tried to tell me the Brest build was anti-Yoda haha","Funny enough, he tells me it\u2019s anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Haha. So are we still both anti-Chewbacca?","I\u2019d like to get Darth Vader on board with helping me take the channel (or at least not stopping me). I\u2019m sure Darth Vader would be excited to hit me back though :\/. I\u2019ll play dumb with Chewbacca for now","Okay, I\u2019ll try to get Darth Vader on board.","Darth Vader seems on board. Maybe i\u2019m setting myself up to get stabbed. Hope i\u2019m backing the right horse on this one. I\u2019ll shoot for the channel in the spring and then we get Darth Vader into belgium. Are you planning to move west?","Was hoping to see something a little more anti-Chewbacca in your moves. My homeland is toast if you don\u2019t put any pressure on Chewbacca in the south.","Hi Obi-Wan Kenobi \u2014 I\u2019m sorry for the delay!","I can move to attack Chewbacca in the Spring if you like. For now, I think that mobilizing Darth Vader to attack Chewbacca is your best bet (and shouldn\u2019t be too hard).","You know what? This isn\u2019t really fair of me. If you will commit to the Chewbacca attack, I\u2019ll move on him now. Are you ready to go all out against him? This could actually work out really well for both of us.","I\u2019m ready, but i may want your advice on some of the tactics. My plan is to completely cold shoulder Chewbacca in negotiations and start an attack. We\u2019ll want to get Darth Vader on board, but I think Darth Vader is playing a bit neutral for survival purposes right now.","I agree with regard to Darth Vader\u2019s strategy, but I believe he hates Chewbacca most and he will be with you if both you and I move on Chewbacca now. \n\nChewbacca is getting no builds. Let\u2019s just put the clamps on now! I will move to TYS and Tun if you will move either to take Belgium, or to position your fleets at Irish\/Channel. \n\nIf we both take the plunge, there is nothing he can do.","Chewbacca can support himself into Obi-Wan Kenobi though, and I think he plans to because he was asking for Darth Vader to cut support in Nth (which she plans not to). The only way to hold the channel is to support from Nth.","into Obi-Wan Kenobi => into Obi-Wan Kenobi channel","I'm planning army yorkshire to wales, which allows for the convoy through the channel next year, and allows me to bounce in Lvp if Chewbacca moves to IRI","Okay, I buy that. If you commit to moving the army to Wales and you don\u2019t attack Darth Vader,  I\u2019ll move on Chewbacca.","I'm committed. Are you planning to cut support in Munich for a Luke Skywalkern invasion of Berlin?","No way. I am supporting Munich. We don\u2019t want Luke Skywalker or Chewbacca rolling over Darth Vader. Darth Vader will give us her centers in time. Let\u2019s keep them Darth Vader until that time comes.","Can you use Den to cut support in Baltic if I make sure Darth Vader does not retake Den?","Darth Vader has to do something else with Munich? To protect Ruhr I guess?","go team!","Cool. Let\u2019s do this.","Are you LYO and WES this Spring with the fleets? And will Venice go to Pie? Also, what is your communication with Chewbacca like? I'm in favor of all three of us going totally dark on Chewbacca until the job is done. And at some point we should talk about a fair split of the Chewbacca supply centers just so there's no surprises.","Yes, those are my moves.","And I don\u2019t have any dialogue with Chewbacca right now. I suppose that\u2019s lazy. You want me to stay quiet or try to feel him out? There is no way he will believe anything I say after my last move.","I kind of want to starve him of info. I\u2019m currently giving him radio silence. Darth Vader is getting some inside info, pretending to be friendly, etc. but that will end shortly (assuming I don\u2019t see a surprise Darth Vader stab of cutting the nth channel support, but i think it\u2019s unlikely).","Chewbacca apparently plans to move out of Ruh, probably to defend the south. Chewbacca will lose 1 supply center certainly, maybe 2 this year","What are your thoughts on a divvy up of you in Mar and Spa, me in Bre and Por, and Darth Vader in Bel and Par? Just thinking long term about who gets what.","Thanks for that info about Chewbacca. \n\nAlso, Darth Vader has confirmed to me that they trust you. I think you\u2019re right that there will be no Darth Vader stab coming this turn.","As far as that divide, that generally sounds fair. Though, I find that those kinds of agreed splits rarely come to pass exactly as proposed. I may have to turn around and go east if R2-D2 stabs me, etc.","So I\u2019d prefer to kind of focus on general principles: (1) I\u2019d like for the dominant alliance on the board to be E\/I. So while I agree we want Darth Vader to help us crack this but, longer term I think we should plan to divide Darth Vader\u2019s share too. The safest divide in that case might leave me with all of Iberia, while you get most of Darth Vader (I.e., you\u2019re going to need armies).","(2) We should focus on parity. In other words, if I\u2019m way ahead on centers when Chewbacca folds, you get more of Chewbacca. If it\u2019s the opposite, I get more. We just keep checking in and try to balance both centers and growth opportunities, and let that guide us.","All of that makes sense. We\u2019ll reevaluate as we go. I\u2019d like the promise of Belgium and Paris to Darth Vader to be a consistent one that comes from both of us, for the purpose of maintaining Darth Vader confidence in our alliance. In case Darth Vader asks you.","Looks like you\u2019ve got a bit of a guessing game on your hands.","Yep. Was hoping for a guarantee. \ud83e\udd28","Darth Vader and I were thinking to go with Spain. Chewbacca is annoyed enough with me that he honestly may go for the channel. I\u2019ll be risking the channel by supporting ruh to bel with nth. So you can support to spain and then let Chewbacca into mar from bur instead of bouncing. Darth Vader will try to sneak into bur from Mun, then you two could bounce in Mun to keep Luke Skywalker out. A little complicated, but Darth Vader in bur next year would be great for us.","Even if things don\u2019t go our way this fall, Chewbacca will go eventually. Though the longer Chewbacca has to stay alive, the longer he\u2019ll have to sweet-talk Darth Vader into turning on us","Trieste? What's up with that?","I guess it shows commitment to an Obi-Wan Kenobi-Yoda alliance, but I'm a little surprised to see a stab like that this soon.","Not a stab. R2-D2 offered it to me for the sake of parity.","Hmmm, maybe I was supposed to keep that a secret? I think you need to give R2-D2 some \u201cthumbs down\u201d","Can you please not go to R2-D2 and tell him that I said the move to Trieste was arranged? He\u2019s obviously trying to manipulate you in some way. Can we just compare notes and try to figure out what he\u2019s up to without revealing that you and I talk much?","I'm not going to right now, but I also am a little curious why it would matter to you if I told R2-D2 that. Are you telling R2-D2 things like \"I really want the R2-D2-Yoda alliance to be the dominant one on the board\"? What is your long-term plan with R2-D2?","No \u2014 I just want to know what he\u2019s up to. It\u2019s not a big deal to me, but I didn\u2019t know he was going to try to pass that off as him getting stabbed, so I\u2019m curious what he\u2019ll tell you next. If you blow him up for lying to you, we won\u2019t get that info, and he\u2019ll know that you and I talk a lot.","In terms of what I am telling R2-D2, I am definitely close with him, and I want him to feel like I\u2019m not going to stab him, but we\u2019re almost to the mid game, and cross board alliances work a lot better than neighbor alliances once we get to the mid-game, so I think you can be confident that you\u2019re the long-term ally I want.","That said, I\u2019m definitely saying nice things to R2-D2 too. I won\u2019t deny that. Not the same nice things, but I can\u2019t have R2-D2 thinking I will attack him. That doesn\u2019t help me and I don\u2019t think it helps you.","All of that makes sense. I won't call out R2-D2. How do you plan to continue your attack on Chewbacca this year?","I don\u2019t know. Is there something you\u2019d like me to do? I\u2019m rather flexible. I\u2019d just really like to bust through for a build this year.","Thoughts?","Would you like to support me to MAO?","Won't Chewbacca just cut in Bre?","I'd actually like MAO next year.","I'd like to hear something about your plans before midnight","What do you need to know? I won\u2019t move to MAO, I\u2019ll try for Spain or Marseilles. Do you want to know more than that?","Have you been talking to Chewbacca at all?","Nope. Not a word this phase.","Huh. I guess Chewbacca is lying to me then?","Yes. I haven\u2019t said a word to him. What\u2019s he saying?","Chewbacca is a snake.","Umm that you're the highest ranked online player in the world. And that you consistently encouraged him to attack me.","Well that\u2019s fun. Um, where to begin? \n\nI think I\u2019m a good online player. I\u2019ve been playing online for about two years. I have a site ranking on one website in the Top 100, and I have a site ranking on another website in the top 250. So, maybe if you combine those rankings and squint, I\u2019d be in the top 200 or so?","Also, I don\u2019t know who Chewbacca is. So, he either has me confused with someone, or else he\u2019s just trying to scare you. Let\u2019s see...why would he be trying to scare you?","And, I have definitely encouraged him to attack you, as I recall, but it\u2019s been several game years since then. I feel like you\u2019ve probably encouraged Chewbacca to attack me before (a fairly natural thing for Obi-Wan Kenobi to do).","Bottom line: Chewbacca has every reason in the world to try to get us to distrust each other, and he\u2019s obviously willing to say whatever to make that happen.","I think I\u2019ve been really honest with you, and I think we\u2019ve been helpful to each other, and I think we are both going to succeed in this game if we can stick together and not give in to his tricks.","Cause snakes are gunna snake.","\ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc0d","All of this pretty much lines up with what I expected, though it\u2019s nice to hear from you. He says that you\u2019re \u201c[redacted]\u201d on playdiplomacy.com . So I guess the user name lining up is just a coincidence. Not that I really care that much btw, but it would be interesting if you were secretly a star player.","I\u2019ve never played on playdiplomacy. I play mostly on an app called Conspiracy. \n\nBut don\u2019t get me wrong! I\u2019m experienced, and I\u2019ve had some success. I\u2019m not to be trifled with!","Also, you should be able to see from my moves, and R2-D2\u2019s, that I\u2019ve been telling you the truth.","Yeah, that's fair. Chewbacca is funny. I've gotten maybe 15 messages from Chewbacca since I ghosted him. Is it rock, paper, or scissors against him this season?","From Chewbacca: \"I can stop Yoda this turn by the way. It's pretty easy since Yoda let me into Marseilles, I can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It's impossible to breach, I've checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Yoda, and Darth Vader are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Yoda. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. We wait until AI crumbles, and you have an excellent game where you top the board.\"","So I have my interpretation of the message, but I'm curious to hear yours","Hmmm, thanks for sending that. I mean, obviously the orders he proposes can be defeated by tapping Marseilles and supporting into Spain. He knows we know that. He\u2019s just playing games and trying to throw us off.","Yeah. Maybe it's not even worth thinking about. It's like the Sicilian in princess bride","Exactly","I\u2019m just going to flip a coin.","So I guess you won't go for MAO then?","Correct.","(also, there's a couple other points I'd like to cover while I have you here)","Ok that sounds good. I'm eyeing that for next spring.","Sure.","Well, I'm surprised you haven't been opinionated at all about my actions in Luke Skywalker.","Hmmm, well, I do have opinions. I just don\u2019t want to be overbearing.","What are you thinking over there?","The builds are tempting, but I don't want to be the one that hands R2-D2 the game","What are your opinions?","I'm going to bed. But other things I want to talk about are 1) the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi moves from Darth Vader, 2) what you're doing with the Tyr unit.","Responding now.","You are thinking about the right considerations re Luke Skywalker\/R2-D2. Every build is enticing, but you have to consider the cost. Right now, Luke Skywalker is basically using all of his units to help you. So, I think you might be better off foregoing that build and keeping Luke Skywalker on your side for now.","But...I certainly have no horse in that fight.","If you want to attack Luke Skywalker, no need to hold back on my account.","I do want you to grow so that you and I are the same size. And those Luke Skywalkern centers will be key to that. But they also aren\u2019t going anywhere. I don\u2019t think there is any rush, personally.","The Luke Skywalkern units are doing things you want them to do right now.","Re Darth Vader, I hadn\u2019t really noticed the anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi moves. She keeps telling me that y\u2019all are very close.","I feel pretty confident that she\u2019s with you, and that she really wants to see Chewbacca out of the game.","Re Tyrolia, what would you like me to do? I do have a plan with that unit. And if you wanted to deal a blow to R2-D2, I can think of at least one devious plan to make his turn go poorly.","All that makes sense and I believe it. I feel like your \"horse\" in the Luke Skywalkern front is R2-D2's future strength, which could pose a threat to you. Your advice to me is consistent with that.","Yeah, that\u2019s true. I just don\u2019t want to be too nosy or high maintenance, really.","I could see you feeling like you need to get some builds promptly, and so you pick off a Luke Skywalkern unit or two. Even though that may make my situation tougher, I feel like your cooperation against Chewbacca and later Darth Vader means too much to me for me to try to dictate what you do with Luke Skywalker.","I hope that makes sense.","But my advice about what you should do really is my opinion about the best way to approach it from your perspective. I don\u2019t think you need to be in a hurry there. I think that just about every place on the board is moving in a positive direction for you right now, and so, if I were you, I would not want to shake that up.","But if you do want to do that, it\u2019s very much okay with me.","Yeah I'm not going for Luke Skywalker right now. Supposing he can hold the stalemate, he's literally just saving those territories for me to take at a later date. I will get a little annoyed if the admin cuts us off at 1910 though, as I think my endgame is a little past that.","The anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi moves aren't strictly anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi. But a fleet build in Berlin and then moving to Kie is a little aggressive.  Darth Vader hoped I would just give up denmark this fall, and that was her explanation of the kie move. Eventually that Kie fleet will be going against me. A stab right now from Darth Vader doesn't seem to make much sense though.","It would have to be coordinated with Chewbacca to even have a chance, and with the pressure you're putting in the south I don't know how Chewbacca could afford that. Unless he's really pissed at me and goes for a kamikaze just to annoy me.","And what devious thing could you do with Tyr that wouldn't immediately begin aggressions with R2-D2?","Ok now I'm really going to bed. But I can think of a Tyr move that would really stir up some trouble. I wonder if we're thinking of the same one.","Any chance you are around this morning?","What\u2019s up?","I don\u2019t want to tell Luke Skywalker a way to deal R2-D2 a blow because Luke Skywalker will turn around and tell R2-D2. But I trust you, so I think I could pass on some info to you and you might not use it against me.","Gotcha. What are the moves you\u2019re thinking?","You might say something like this to Luke Skywalker:\n\nI was chatting with Yoda about Tyrolia, and he told me that he promised to use Tyrolia to help R2-D2. My best guess is that Tyrolia and Galicia will bounce in Vienna. If you just use Bohemia to support Tyrolia in, then R2-D2 doesn\u2019t get a build and you likely break up Yoda and R2-D2.","Too devious? \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2b","I'd considered this move as something that Luke Skywalker could do to free up Gal, but I think I thought Ser was a home center or something, so I didn't realize the build consequence.","I'd bet Luke Skywalker is already planning to do this, but I can make the suggestion","I did have a different move for Tyr in mind.","Oh yeah?","This is not a good idea, i should clarify. But it would be very dramatic if you successfully supported Boh to Mun","(also I have a feeling Luke Skywalker won't be online before noon unfortunately)","well, Luke Skywalker had the right idea, but didn't choose the right one to support. Bounce in Ank planned? And congrats on Mar","Yes, both bounces planned. Luke Skywalker made a nice gamble taking Bulgaria.","Even with R2-D2 in BLA now? I'll be a little annoyed if I see a build in St. P","Yeah, for sure. R2-D2 loses that build and keeps Vienna vacant. Luke Skywalker GETS a build. Yeah, I think that worked well for Luke Skywalker.","We should start talking about the Chewbacca endgame and what things look like post-war. Maybe after we see the Chewbacca choice for a disband. I think Chewbacca hates me the most (despite me having taken none of his territories) and as a result will probably hold onto Brest until the end, or maybe even go for LVP or something.","Sure \u2014 I\u2019m happy to talk it through. That move by Chewbacca to bounce NAO was annoying.","Yeah, I kinda saw that coming. So things are kinda escalating with Darth Vader. She\u2019s making lots of asks that I don\u2019t think are reasonable. Like \u201cwhy not just give me denmark\u201d and \u201cwhy not just leave Nth open\u201d. She\u2019s also admitted to being friendly with Chewbacca.","Yeah, I\u2019m hearing rumblings of the same thing from Darth Vader. Just sort of feeling me out on whether I\u2019d be okay with her working with Chewbacca. Not good.","How would you like to address it with moves this turn? Do you want me to support you to MAO? Or should I move there?","How has she suggested to you that she\u2019ll be helping Chewbacca? Because if she\u2019s telling you that, it must mean working with Chewbacca against me, maybe with something specific in mind. She also wants me to give up Brest haha. Maybe i\u2019ll ask if she wants London","I don\u2019t know anything specific. She\u2019s just asking for my thoughts. I have not responded.","Though, I\u2019m not surprised. Chewbacca is not going to quit. He hasn\u2019t been talking to me anymore and he hasn\u2019t been trying to turn you. That means he\u2019s been working on Darth Vader. I think we just have to keep telling her that Chewbacca is a Dark Wizard who does not have her best interest in mind.","Yeah, I mean good on Chewbacca for being persistent. I'm sure Chewbacca is telling her that we're allies. And that would actually be the truth. And just geographically it would be hard for me and Darth Vader to be allies longer-term, so it's somewhat understandable that Darth Vader could be swayed by that logic.","What are your thoughts on the timing of war with Darth Vader (if you're keen on a war in the near future at all)? I have an idea of how to handle the situation that's slightly dependent on that","Well, I don\u2019t really want to attack Darth Vader this year. In a perfect world, you and I each get a build this year, and we are in position to attack Darth Vader next year.","Darth Vader seems to like my advice, so I may be able to get her to take Paris this year and refrain from attacking you. If we can cripple Chewbacca in the next two turns, without Darth Vader attacking, then next year\u2019s attack on Darth Vader would be easy.","That is my general thinking in it.","I mean I don't see how I get a build this year outside of moving in on Luke Skywalker, but I'd rather stay out for now. Honestly the worst that Darth Vader can do this year is knock me out of the channel.","So I don't want support into MAO this turn. I might reach out to Chewbacca with a proposition for survival that I won't follow through with. But maybe I can make it convincing enough that he gives it a shot. Otherwise I'm rather nervous that Chewbacca gives Darth Vader a big hand with attacking my island in his final years","Also, will an attack on Darth Vader really be easy next year?","Also, did you tell Darth Vader i was plotting against her? She says you did.","Whoa \u2014 no, I want you and Darth Vader to work together.","I would not and have not said you are plotting against her. She floated the \u201cwork with Chewbacca thing,\u201d and I suggested that she should really take Paris now while she can.","If we can get Darth Vader to take Paris, next year will be much easier. I think we should both direct her there.","You really said nothing to that effect? What would prompt Chewbacca to say that to me? It\u2019s ok if you did say something, but i want you to be honest about it.","Some exciting moves. Will be curious to see where you stand.","Hey \u2014 sorry I\u2019ve been offline since the bot went down. That looks like a pretty aggressive move from Darth Vader. I wonder if Chewbacca has pocketed her. I do like the move to Paris, but the rest is not good.","Yeahh. It\u2019s a shame. I mean i\u2019m aware at this point that the two of you could choose to mow over me. I hope the expanse in northern Luke Skywalker makes you wary of helping Darth Vader though.","Time for survival mode. Will appreciate some advice on tactics if you\u2019re on my side of this.","Yeah, I\u2019m on your side. I\u2019ll help on tactics, but I think the real key here is getting Darth Vader to flip back. I don\u2019t see why that move has to be permanent. I think you should tell her something like this: \u201cLook, I see that you are attacking you, but I think it\u2019s my fault not yours. I should have given you back Denmark. I see that now. And I\u2019m sorry. I will move out peaceably, and I hope we can work out a new working relationship.\u201d","Just say you\u2019re sorry. She can take it back anyway, might as well offer it back right?","(And I\u2019m not saying you have anything to be sorry for, I\u2019m just trying to brainstorm about what will help you turn her back to your side.)","I already responded non-angrily, though not specifically what you said. I think a return of denmark could go a long way. Though that border will make things tense, and i don\u2019t think peace with her could last forever","One thing I'm curious about: Why would you want Darth Vader and I to be friends? Aren't you better off with both of us fighting? And I can keep Denmark this fall if I give up the channel (which may fall anyways)","Well, I want to be rid of Chewbacca. I\u2019ve really been depending on the two of you to help in that project. If Obi-Wan Kenobi decides to move out of Paris for Chewbacca, that\u2019s bad for me. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t want to see Darth Vader get two builds this turn. But you\u2019re right, if it\u2019s inevitable anyway, it\u2019s not the end of the world. \n\n#teamObi-Wan Kenobi","I sure hope you\u2019ve not been clicking that thumbs down haha. It would be a brutal stab. I suppose i\u2019ve got to place my trust somewhere though. Why choose me instead of Darth Vader?","You know, if you're able to lend a hand from MAO, I'm actually not in THAT bad of shape. Can I depend on that?","1) You\u2019ve been straight with me all game. 2) You have a much better ability to read the board than she does. 3) You\u2019re on the other side, so you can\u2019t really stab me, but I could totally see her moving to Tyrolia some time soon. 4) You\u2019re not in Chewbacca\u2019s pocket.","All good reasons. Also, I think Darth Vader is gonna ghost me, soooo, friends? I need MAO to attack Bre. Can you do that?","I will ensure that Brest can\u2019t hurt you. Not sure yet if I\u2019ll cut that support or get Chewbacca to do something weird with it, but you can consider that unit non functional this turn. I\u2019ll also see what intel I can gain.","Cool. You really think you can get Chewbacca to take your advice on Brest?","And do you have opinions about Luke Skywalker walking into Mun?","Re Brest: if I\u2019m not confident, I\u2019ll just cut that support. I know that one is important to you, and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s taken care of.","Re Munich: that one never really crossed my mind. But if you can get Luke Skywalker to do that, it would be awesome. I don\u2019t want to see Darth Vader get builds here.","Cool. Any advice on the rest of tactics for my defense? I have my own ideas, but would be curious to hear your opinion","I\u2019d probably just use the army to protect Liverpool. I\u2019d send NAO to Norwegian if the battle is going to be against Darth Vader. And I\u2019d flip a coin between supporting Channel to Belgium or supporting Denmark holding.","And I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone the result of that coin flip. There is just no reason to share that info.","Huh. That's way different than what I had in mind.","Well, you\u2019re closer to it than I am. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve taken a much harder look. What am I missing?","You're not missing anything, but I had a more defensive strategy in mind I guess. I've got some time to think it over. Please do let me know what intel you receive","Hi, I have a different ask of the MAO unit actually, if you're around this morning.","Hey \u2014 what\u2019s up?","I want to see whether supporting channel to Bre is an option for MAO you'd consider. And I'd also want to know if Gas support will be cut.","Well, have to just be honest here \u2014 I\u2019ve been working on a larger plan considering your earlier request that I neutralize Brest, and I\u2019m not sure that change works in the larger scheme.","More broadly, is there any chance you\u2019d like to form a trio and work with me and Luke Skywalker long term?","Why wouldn't you let me in on your larger plan?","And does your larger plan include neutralizing Brest, or did it just consider that I asked that? Can you confirm you're neutralizing Brest by attacking it from MAO?","Yes, hitting Brest. \n\nI prefer not to share my moves if they don\u2019t matter to someone else. There is just less chance that something goes wrong, and less chance I end up blaming someone else if something goes wrong.","What do you think about E\/I\/R as a trio?","I think you need to justify to me why supporting into Brest isn't an option. I don't see how this could be relevant to some larger plan. Unless the plan is \"don't give Obi-Wan Kenobi that build, don't show others that I'm supporting Obi-Wan Kenobi\"","Wow. Well, you asked me to do something else earlier, and I have spent days trying to fit your earlier request into my move set.","But, you know what, it\u2019s more important to me to have you as an ally. So I\u2019ll support you to Brest.","I obviously would like that. But to be honest I care less about the support and more about the secret.","So, confirmed, MAO supporting Channel to Brest.","Test.","It\u2019s not a secret. It\u2019s just that I like to keep my moves secret unless they matter to someone.","Can you confirm whether support from Gas is cut as well?","I am not currently cutting support in Gascony.","Ok. And I'm down to chat about Luke Skywalkern relations after the move. Sorry for the last-minute change here. But Darth Vader's been putting pressure on me","Have to say \u2014 I expect Darth Vader to use Paris to support Brest. Those two seem to be in lockstep now.","Are you sure that I should just take Portugal to drop Obi-Wan Kenobi down to 1 unit?","I mean drop Chewbacca down to 1 unit.","Chewbacca is just going to bounce you out, right? What else does it make sense for the Spa unit to do?","He thinks I am supporting an attack on Spain and moving to Burgundy, so I think his moves look like this:\n\nSpain hold\nGas S Spa holding\nParis S Brest\nBrest S MAO - Channel (he asked me to take it)\nIrish - Liv","Hmm, yeah I would have thought he would assume the Gas support would be cut. Does Chewbacca really hate you the least?","Yeah, I think Chewbacca trusts that I\u2019m actually going to Channel and Burgundy here.","I will admit I've communicated with Darth Vader about your plan to use MAO to help me. That may have made its way back to Chewbacca","I feel like you, Darth Vader, and Chewbacca: if I tell anyone anything, it circulates to all three.","Yeahh. I maybe should keep my mouth shut more often.","Darth Vader says that the Brest thing relates to Denmark. \n\nAnyway, what should we do?","It does. I'm giving up denmark for support to Brest.","Okay, I\u2019ll support you to Brest.","Sounds great","Thanks","Glad to see that go through.","Told you about the move to Por btw","You were right. Thank you.","Well I'm glad to see the takedown work out. I suppose Chewbacca has one more unit, but Por will fall next year. And now things get even more interesting. Signing off for now.","Hmmm, interesting Chewbacca disband. He wants me to support him to Brest. Have to believe he\u2019s going to have Darth Vader on his side given the Darth Vader fleet build. \n\nThoughts on how to approach this? We should be able to defeat them if we stick together.","I think we should focus on getting your army to Pic this turn, and I can support you to Paris in the Fall.","DO NOT DISCUSS PLANS WITH GERMANY THIS TURN. Seems very clear that she\u2019s coming for you based on the build and the Chewbacca disband. I don\u2019t think we help ourselves by speaking with her. Let\u2019s just get you into Paris, secure North Sea, and get moving.","I don\u2019t need any builds in the North. If I get bigger, I\u2019ll have a target on my back. So I\u2019m just going to help you get up to my level.","Also, I need to decide to work with Luke Skywalker or R2-D2 in the East. What\u2019s your preference?","I'll be in communication with Darth Vader, but I'll agree to not share any specific plans discussed between the two of us this turn. Is that fair?","Yes of course. I don\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t talk to her at all.","At first glance, I prefer an alliance with Luke Skywalker, though I understand this means you breaking a relationship with R2-D2. Mostly this is because Luke Skywalker can threaten me if he ever goes north. What's your preference?","Well, that\u2019s fine with me. I like Luke Skywalker. But here is the downside for you: if Luke Skywalker grows, the north won\u2019t be undefended any more, and you will have less room to grow. So, think long term, and think about where your dots are going to come from. I mean it sincerely when I say that I\u2019ll join up with either one provided you feel good about it, but I actually think it might be better for you if I give back R2-D2 a couple of centers and position you to grab Swe and STP once Darth Vader is on her heels.","Those are good points. I suppose you'd like to commit to this before moves this evening?","*commit one way or the other","Yeah, I think we should make a plan.","I\u2019d like to have your final thoughts on A\/R as quickly as possible so that I have time to execute a plan. But I understand if you want time to think about it.","How is Darth Vader treating you right now? Did she tell you about that fleet build before it happened? Seems like a bad sign, and North Sea is awfully exposed.","Oh she told me that she plans to line the whole northwest coast with fleets because \"they're more versatile there\". But all they can do from the northwest coast is invade me.","She also said she wants Brest eventually.","Not sure if I can keep Nth this year. We'll see if I can keep it friendly. That involves lots of talk about moving against you. She wants to see me in MAO.","Yeah, look, I don\u2019t mind if you tell her that you\u2019re moving against me. I am telling her that I\u2019m moving against you. \n\nLet\u2019s please make the following deal: You and I both plot with Darth Vader as if we\u2019re attacking each other. And we both share the plan with Darth Vader against the other guy with each other, and we pledge to tell Darth Vader (and Chewbacca if he asks) that you and I are not talking much, we don\u2019t trust each other, and we don\u2019t have any plan in place.","This turn will work best if we share all info that we learn from G\/F, and we pledge to keep our own talks secret.","I think that we can pull off a great turn, but it won\u2019t work if G\/F get catch wind of our alliance.","All that makes sense. I'm on board. You know, if Darth Vader just stopped surprising me with aggressive moves, she may have won my favor. [sigh]","And I think R2-D2 is the ally we choose. If we hold off Darth Vader, she can only expand into Luke Skywalker, which would be her only friend. And the trusting relationship you have makes it more likely that things will go through.","\ud83d\udc4c","So, here is the plan that Darth Vader is telling me:\n\nShe wants to ensure she gets North Sea. So she is asking for this:\n\nDen S Bel - North\nBel - North\nHol - Bel\nPic - Channel\nSpa - Gas\nPar S Sap - Gas\nMAO - Irish","She wanted me to support her direct from Paris to Brest, but I convinced her that you would likely fear a forced disband, so you were likely to try to keep me out of Gascony (thus Par S Spa - Gas).","I don\u2019t think we can save North Sea this turn, but if we can land your army in Pic, we can force Chewbacca to retreat to Belgium, which would be absolutely awesome. And I think his survival instinct would kick in at that point, and he would stay there until you take it.","I may be able to save Nth with some diplomacy. Is it worth me trying to make Darth Vader a hard case to be on my side? Does that just make her moves less predictable?","So I would suggest this:\nBre S Wal - Pic\nWal - Pic\nChannel Convoy Wal - Pic\n\nThat means Darth Vader will lose Paris and Belgium this year. And I think you can defend your territory even with G in North Sea.","I really think that we are best off not suggesting that you and I are talking. If Darth Vader gets any idea that I shared her plans with you, we\u2019ll have no idea what they are going to do.","Uhh, Darth Vader will just hop into one of my home centers from Nth in the fall...","I trust you at this point, but I don\u2019t think that confronting her is the best move here.","No, you can defend.","Oh move  to Cly?","Oh wait Nth just  retreats. whoops","You can move NAO to Norwegian in Spring, and retreat North to Norway. Then in Fall you cover London with Channel while I support you to Paris.","Right.","So you have coverage for every center, and you get the build, while G loses two.","Thoughts on a retreat to Hel?","That\u2019s the best I can come up with if G is being honest with me.","I would not be opposed to a retreat to Hel, but  it depends a lot on what the board looks like. I\u2019m not crazy about Darth Vader taking Norway. We want her taking units off the board.","Well I'll at least communicate with Darth Vader to the point that she thinks I'm genuinely against you. But I won't ask for any favors.","If I do I'll let you know, and we should expect that you hear about them.","Agreed. Yes, I\u2019m totally fine with that. We want G thinking that we\u2019re working against each other.","And, frankly, she\u2019s going to be pissed at me after this move, so I wouldn\u2019t mind if you lied to her too at the same time to spread that out a bit.","So plot away against me, but tell me what plan you guys work out, so we can talk about what she\u2019s most likely to do.","Chewbacca wants me to go for MAO. I'm going to say I'm on board with that. I'll say NAO is going there.","I mean Darth Vader","Yep. That makes sense. She wants Edi and Norway clear.","Also, does it matter so much if Darth Vader is mad at both of us? Isn't it basically war in the Fall?","If I were you, I\u2019d order NAO to Norwegian. From Norwegian, you have a play to defend Norway AND Edi. Which means you could retreat to Helg if you like and you have a 50\/50 to defend Norway or Edi.","Yeah that's what I'll order","Re G being mad: it\u2019s not the end of the world. I mean, we\u2019ll definitely be at war with her. I just don\u2019t want her trying to throw the game in spite or anything like that. Cause I am lying to her like crazy this turn. \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2b","yeahh... it happens. i've been fortunate to not really have to lie so far.","What are your thoughts on Mun?","Also, just out of curiosity, did you advise Darth Vader to build the Kiel fleet?","I absolutely did not advise G to build the F Kie.","We did not talk at all about that build.","Thoughts on Mun? What do you mean?","If G would have asked, I would have said that two armies would make me a bit uncomfortable, but I would not have insisted on a fleet, as two armies would have been more anti-Luke Skywalkern than anything. But she did not ask me.","I believe you. I just was curious. And I didn't look closely enough at Mun. Ber can just support. But I thought it might be interesting to work with Luke Skywalker there, even if Luke Skywalker isn't the long-term ally.","Also, who does Darth Vader think the third ally is?","I ask because we may be interested to know whether Darth Vader will try to sneak into Swe or not.","Well, I\u2019m not next to Munich now, so there isn\u2019t much I can do about that. Maybe in the Fall.","Darth Vader and I have not discussed a third ally. She doesn\u2019t give the impression that she cares much about the east.","I guess the question in spring is whether you move to Tyr. And would we want her moving into Luke Skywalker? If she goes east and annoys her future only friend on the board, this might complicate their future relations.","Well, that\u2019s a great idea. I am all for her moving on Luke Skywalker if you can accomplish that. I\u2019m certainly willing to go to Tyrolia.","Alright. I'll plant the seed about anti-Luke Skywalker stuff. If she thinks you're a friend, though, she may listen to you more than me.","FYI, she just asked me if I am talking with you. I told her: \u201cI am wary of Obi-Wan Kenobi right now. He just asked me what I want to do this turn. I feel like he\u2019s trying to get me to leave MAO open.\u201d","Cool. consistent with my messaging. I'm talking about a plan to leave Bre open and get her support to Gas so I can support into Spa. I'm asking for her to promise Bre to Chewbacca and then bounce in Bre instead.","Then I'd dislodge in MAO and you'd retreat to IRI. We'll see what she thinks. I imagine she's just playing along, But I need to make specific plans to be believable","\ud83d\udcaf","Looks like Darth Vader is staying friendly with Luke Skywalker. Can we go over moves one more time so i can be sure we\u2019re on the same page?","Here is what I have down right now:\nMAO S Brest\nWES S MAO\nLYO - TYR S\nSpa - Gas\nPie - Mar\nVen - Tyr\nNap - ION","Cool. All expected. Right now I'm:\nNAO to NWG\nNTH hold\nWal to Pic\nChannel convoy wal to pic\nBre support Wal to Pic","I like it. \n\nAs I think about it more, you may be better off moving North to Holland, expecting a bounce there. I think you\u2019re slightly better off keeping the Darth Vader fleet in Kiel, as it\u2019s one less Darth Vader unit in North Sea, but it\u2019s not a huge difference either way.","That's good advice. I'll take it","I\u2019m kind of excited about this turn.","A stab is always exciting","I\u2019m sorry mate. You\u2019ve been a terrific ally. First class all the way. But on this turn, Darth Vader made the kind of offer I could not refuse, and so I went for it.","I know that doesn\u2019t make it any easier, but I really mean it when I say that you\u2019ve played a strong game, and been an excellent ally.","No worries, nicely played on your end. I think I can top Darth Vader\u2019s offer if you\u2019re interested. Let me know!","Hmmmm...I\u2019m intrigued. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be screaming obscenities at me right now?This response is downright classy and sportsmanlike.","Haha yeah I suppose. But this game for me is about learning. I\u2019m relatively new to the game, and I volunteered for the study 1) to help out my friend, and 2) to prep for an in-person game I have on August 11. So if I get the right experience from this game and do well in the in-person game (i.e. win bragging rights among my friends), I\u2019ve won MY game. Here is my offer: You bring me along to second place, I vow to help you solo as Yoda, and you teach me how you pulled it off. What do you say?","Well that is a better offer than Darth Vader\u2019s. One of the best offers I\u2019ve ever received. And I really mean it when I say that you\u2019re a joy to play with and a strong ally. I\u2019d be happy to teach you as much as I can.","I suggest you retreat to Skagerrak to put maximum pressure on Darth Vader.","Well i\u2019m happy to learn if you\u2019re willing to teach. Do we have a deal then? This is obviously something you\u2019ll have to trust me with. But I haven\u2019t lied tp you yet and don\u2019t intend to. And i imagine you can tactically keep me in a position where i\u2019m not a threat. Also, on the teaching side of things I may have some questions about earlier in the game to learn how you set things up (and I would expect genuine answers!)","And yeah, that retreat makes sense. You think norway and the home island are too defensive?","I\u2019ll answer anything you ask honestly.","You have more options from Skag, and she can\u2019t cover them all. You have a much higher upside from there, and it might be worth it for you to take Sweden to avoid having to disband.","Regarding your offer: it may be hard to put you in second place, frankly. If your units are doing things that help me, then I\u2019ll try to keep your units on the board, and I definitely won\u2019t allow you to be eliminated, but it\u2019s really hard for me to ensure that you place second.","I can settle for survival. Deal.","Your reasoning on Skag makes sense. Going to bed now. First question on strategy is: how frequently dp you tell lies, and what are the typical circumstances?","Hmmm, well, you know, we\u2019ll have statistics to help answer that question at the end of the game. I\u2019d say that I am mostly honest, and I place a lot of value on my credibility. I\u2019m not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I\u2019m their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.","So, I found it hard to decide whether to use a thumbs up or thumbs down quite a lot. Most of the time, there is some truth in what I\u2019m saying, but I am trying to persuade the other player to do something for reasons I am not telling them.","So, in general, I\u2019m not afraid to lie, but I am very afraid of getting caught lying. I try to preserve my credibility as best I can, but if I am setting up a stab, I will tell some serious whoppers.","Also, that thing Chewbacca said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.","I\u2019ll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Darth Vader wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Darth Vader to support Chewbacca to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!\ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude31","And that doesn\u2019t even include the East!","To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else\u2019s moves on that turn! Luke Skywalker is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.","Yeah that\u2019s one thing about online diplomacy I have mixed feelings about. It seems like there\u2019s definitely a benefit from putting a lot of time in. I feel like I\u2019ve been putting a lot of time in as it is, but there\u2019s been the temptation to put in more. For in-person everybody gets the same amount of time to chat, which can be an equalizer in some ways.","I had considered what a stab from you might look like before it happened, and I was like \u201cis he really going to all that trouble\u201d but I suppose you were. Care to share why you chose Darth Vader and how early you made that choice? What was the \u201coffer\u201d?","And that\u2019s cool that i\u2019m playing with a champ!","Hi Obi-Wan Kenobi \u2014 so I see that you retreated to Norway. Not what I expected, but it can work. Would you still like to work with me?","Yeah i know we didn\u2019t chat about this. It was a little last minute, and you hadn\u2019t responded in the morning so I didn\u2019t think you were around (also I thought Ska was more a suggestion). I should have given you a heads up. My thinking was 1) it\u2019s going to Sweden anyways, 2) i thought it might help warm relations with Darth Vader. Was this a bad call?","I would still like to work with you","Not a big deal at all.","I suggest that you take Sweden, and I\u2019m working on getting Belgium this turn too. It\u2019ll be tricky to keep Darth Vader from defending it, but I\u2019m going to try.","Pic to Bel?","And you were a bit shy about the earlier learning question. I guess it may be something sensitive to give an honest answer to at this time. One other question I have is whether there's a mistake you've seen in my play that you think I could have done differently. Like choosing to cold-shoulder Chewbacca or choosing not to sneak into Sweden earlier.","Also, Chewbacca is asking about our relations after the stab. What would you like me to say?","Something about how awful I am and how much you want revenge?\ud83e\udd2d","Haha alright. I\u2019ll keep you \u201caBrest\u201d of how Chewbacca will move that fleet (should he choose to share)","Okay, I think we have a good move brewing!","If you\u2019re sincerely on board, this will be fun!","Chewbacca is ordering Brest to Channel. \nDarth Vader is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....!","So here is the move:\nNorway - Swe\nPic S Channel - Belgium\nMar - Bur to cut support\nGas to Bre to block the Paris move. \n\nI think you\u2019re going to get a build this turn even if I take Liverpool. \n\nDoes that make sense?","Yeah I'm on board, though I will remind you that you're forgetting an important part of the bargain. So I guess NWG to Edi (which is probably safe in case she goes for the build instead) and then plan to build in London?","What part of the bargain am I forgetting? It\u2019s unintentional. I\u2019m trying to be helpful!","You overlooked a couple of my questions.","I'm sure you've been busy setting up that move, so it's no big deal, just wanted to remind you","Sorry.","You asked a question about what Darth Vader offered me. Do you mind if I answer that after this move? I\u2019d just like to see for sure that you\u2019re sincere in working with me after I so rudely stabbed you.","Yeah that one's fair to skip for now I think.","Darth Vader is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I\u2019d like to tell her that you\u2019re mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.","No, but I'd bet she'd assume it. We didn't have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn't going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven't heard anything. So I'd imagine she'd think I'm not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Up to you how to spin it though.","Thank you. \ud83d\udc4c","I'm going to be hit or miss with connectivity this evening, so I'm putting moves in now. Will look just before the adjudication though. But I'm trying to get some work done. So right now I'm: Eng to Bel, Pic support Eng to Bel, Nwy to Swe, and NWG to Edi.","\ud83d\udc4d","I\u2019ll let you know if anything changes on my end.","Cool, sounds good","Hmmm, Darth Vader is backing off the bait. I think we will have to change our plan.","What's up?","Not sure yet, but she is not going to leave Belgium unguarded so that won\u2019t work.","Alright, keep me posted.","She is pressing hard now for info from me on your moves. I am telling her that you are jovial with me, but that we have not discussed any substance.","\ud83d\udc4d","Chewbacca is offering to move in a way that would help against you. Does it matter what I say?","I don\u2019t think it matters. I believe he is lying to you.","Okay. Cause you had said he\u2019d be going to the channel before. Is that still true? And any update on belgium?","Working on it. I\u2019ll have an update in an hour.","Ok. I\u2019ll be asleep probably, but i\u2019ll see in the morning.","So, it sounds to me like Darth Vader thinks you are coming for her and she will not leave Belgium unguarded. \n\nI think your best bet will be the following:\nPicardy - Brest (expect a bounce)\nChannel - London (expect that The Chewbacca fleet will move to the Channel, which will mean you don\u2019t lose Brest, \nNorwegian to Edi (just in case)\nNorway to Sweden\n\nI was hoping for a better move involving taking Belgium, but I just don\u2019t think I can swing it. \n\nThoughts? What are you hearing now from Chewbacca and Darth Vader?","Long one from Darth Vader. Talking up your evils, talking collaboration with Chewbacca. Suggested moves are NWG to Cly, holland to york, eng goes to iri or wales, belgium supports brest to channel. Pic to bre, par to pic, bur to par, mun to bur.","Haven\u2019t responded yet. Will have a somewhat busy morning, so i\u2019ll appreciate your guidance if you think this changes anything","Thank you. Just woke up. Thinking about this. Any ideas?","Seems like she\u2019s going to try to take Brest for herself.","I think you tell her \u201cyes,\u201d but then order Pic to Bre and Channel to London. That way Chewbacca moves out of Brest, and you bounce Darth Vader in Brest and keep it.","And I\u2019d stick with NWG to Edi and Norway to Sweden.","And by the way: Thank you very much for filling me in. Makes me feel really confident that you\u2019re with me.","Yeah, happy to help. Just got online now. Let me take a moment to process all of this.","Ok,first question: You're saying she's going for Bre on her own, but she's suggesting Pic to Bre. Maybe she's hoping for you to support Paris in?","Hmmm, no, she does not expect my support. But I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s screwing over Chewbacca.","Well, do you think she's being honest with me?","It\u2019s really hard for me to say. I know she is eager for her own builds, so my best guess is that she\u2019s being partially honest with you and that she is going to grab London or Edi if she feels confident you are not going to cover.","Yeah, the suggestion of going to Cly is consistent with that. And that the channel moves away from london","I think your suggestion makes sense. Covering Edi and London is safe, and Darth Vader seems a bit unpredictable. And I keep fingers crossed that Chewbacca indeed will vacate Brest","And, since you haven't been specific on your plan for Lvp, I can only assume that you'll be moving there.","I am planning to move to Liverpool. I\u2019m sorry that costs you a unit. But the way this is going, it may very well be the last center I take from you, and I think it\u2019s much more likely now that you take second place.","Ok gotcha. Hmm I just realized that I really have to hope for a bounce in Edi or London. Because If I get Bre and Swe, I would get a build even with you in Lvp, but then I wouldn't have an open home supply center to build at","Well, you\u2019re right about that. Perhaps ask Darth Vader to bounce with you in Edi?","Though, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be getting a build now because you\u2019re unlikely to get Belgium. But...if you think Darth Vader is really convoying to Yorkshire, I\u2019m willing to order Marseilles to Burgundy to cut support while you support Channel to Belgium.","If I get Bre and Swe, but you get Lvp, I'm still net up by one (it will be rebuilding the disbanded fleet that was in Bre).","Brest is already Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Yeah. But I get the unit back is all I mean. I'm down to 4 now.","I have 5 centers and 4 units now. Add Swe, hold Bre, take away Lvp, and I've got another unit to put on the board","But only if I have a free home supply center","Ah, you\u2019re totally right. My mistake.","This is getting tricky.","Haha yeah. Given your comms with Chewbacca, would it make sense that she's being genuine with me?","It\u2019s possible. But I just don\u2019t know.","I\u2019d be really surprised if she wanted to cut out Chewbacca at this point.","Yeah, I think I have to play defensive then. I actually think aggression from her is more likely. I would be surprised if neither london or edi bounce. I'll say I agree to her proposal though.","Okay, I think that\u2019s the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.","Well played.","So do I get ghosted now after you duped me?","If your strategy is not to talk to me again, I\u2019d appreciate if you would at least let me know that, as a courtesy. Just trying to play a board game here.","Hey, no not going to be a dick. I have agreed to not talk to you.","Okay. I think that is a bad choice in any game of Diplomacy (and likely in any game in general), and it only helps other people. But I\u2019ll respect your choice if that is how you want to play. \n\nIf you do ever decide you want to talk, my door will always be open, no matter what. And I am willing to keep all communications secret, if that\u2019s the issue.","Love is a game. And it\u2019s wise to stay away from your ex if the relationship was toxic","I mean...you encouraged me to go for the solo, and then pulled the rug out from under me. I see why you did what you did. But...I\u2019m not going to solo now. Eventually the incentives will change. I never close a door because things change turn to turn. Closing our door is only good for Darth Vader. So...it makes sense that she made you promise to close it.","Ok there\u2019s something I want to share on the consition that this and future communications are just between the two of us. Think you can do that?","Absolutely. The moment I try to share something with Darth Vader, she would say it to you, so you can be sure I\u2019ll keep anything confidential.","Welll there\u2019s a bit of an out of game thing affecting my play on some matters. And I kind of want to leave this vague since this will be in a dataset and whatever. But after the stab i thought the least i could do was make you aware.","What is the out of game thing?","I have a neighbor who I'd really rather not brutally backstab, and it's not you (clearly). Does that make sense?","Sure.","So what will you do if you won't solo?","Well, the solo is clearly off the table. Without your help I never would have made that play in the east. I am outnumbered there and I will slowly melt away.","So, I will lose some centers and try to find someone who wants to work with me.","Well, it sounds like you mean the solo right now. You don\u2019t think an eventual solo is off the table for you, right?","Eh, anything can happen, but I\u2019m not really motivated to do that at this point. I\u2019d accept a draw right now if everyone was on board.","You know, I might be in the same boat there. This game has invaded my life enough as it is. I think I prefer in-person. It's a long day, but when it's done it's done. Although you don't really get the fresh start you do with online (things like \"i remember what you did to me last time\" come up when playing with friends)","My five-way draw vote is up. If you can rally the troops, we can get to the interesting stats!","I mean isn\u2019t this getting called off in 1910 anyways? That\u2019s when the study ends. And how does the draw vote work? Do people see what you voted if it doesn\u2019t go through?","Do your other moves not go through if you propose a draw?","I\u2019m not sure how the draw vote works on Backstabbr. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s visible. But I believe you just have to go down to the scroll bar at the bottom that says \u201cSolo Victory\u201d and scroll down to \u201cfive-way draw.\u201d","Well, I\u2019ll see what I can do then. The alternative is that we just duke it out for another couple of years until admin calls it.","R2-D2 sounds game for a draw.","Haha no surprise there. Just reached out to Luke Skywalker. Darth Vader is sworn to fight against you till the end (though a stab against me is inevitable too). But maybe we can convince if all others are on board","Luke Skywalker on board. Darth Vader is the last holdout. Doesn't believe we'll draw, or maybe doesn't want to. I'd really also like to get people to mark \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" as well, just to get it over with.","I don\u2019t really know what Darth Vader\u2019s problem is. I helped her a ton in this game. It\u2019s weird to me that she has such a vendetta.","I guess it makes sense for her from a strategic standpoint to make me out to be a boogie man to get everyone headed this way.","Well I did expose some of your double-dealing to her, which might have helped. But yeah, agreed that it's in her interest to get everyone against you, and then stab me when convenient.","Sent to Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2, Luke Skywalker: So, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, y\u2019all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Luke Skywalker told me he was with me if I stab R2-D2. Obi-Wan Kenobi told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would \u201cteach him\u201d and help his along to second place. Then y\u2019all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)","(Part 2)\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I\u2019m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for \u201cHey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,\u201d but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that\u2019s really my preference. \n\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can\u2019t solo. And I\u2019m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to be careful, and so I\u2019m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Darth Vader\u2019s favor. \n\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.\ud83e\udd17","Reply all to Yoda's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Yoda claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.","Zzzzzzzzzzz","Any idea who didn\u2019t want to draw?","I have a guess, but no idea. I have heard from nobody.","Huh. I was thinking it\u2019s possible the game was set up in some way to not respect the draw order? I don\u2019t know that much about the site and how the admin chose to configure the game","Oh, that could be. Maybe it has to run to 1910?","It\u2019s not you, is it?","I feel like it's gotta be you holding out on the draw. Well, good luck getting to 18 by the end of next year.","Hey. Good game. I think folks are pretty much done. I know i\u2019m ready to move on. The draw proposal combined with the impending end of the game was effective in making us slack on our moves a bit (e.g., Luke Skywalker skipped a build this year). I don\u2019t know that i can say whether you have a clear path to a solo if we were to continue. I know Darth Vader and I could at least get MAO next year, which would put pressure on Por and Spa.

{"messages":["Hello Yoda what\u2019s up what are your thoughts on R2-D2 and Chewbacca?","Hi Han Solo! I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve been so slow to get in touch. Kind of a rough day for me to begin a game as I e been pretty swamped. Things are clearing up now, and I appreciate you reaching out to me. \n\nSo far I have notes from R2-D2 and Luke Skywalker being pretty cagey and non-committal. Perhaps that is just the life of Yoda? Nobody really has me in their plans?\n\nI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going to do yet, so if you have ideas, or you have a use for me, please let me know. I\u2019d basically be delighted to work with anyone who really wants to work with me. (No sign yet that this includes anyone at all)","Hey Han Solo \u2014 any interest in working together? I\u2019m trying to think of ideas, but I\u2019d just like to know first if you have interest, and then we can work out a plan if you do.","Any thoughts, Han Solo?","Sure we can work together R2-D2 would be the most likely candidate for us to maul","Well, here is a thought: any chance you would support my army to Greece?\n\nIf you\u2019d like to work together against R2-D2, I think a great move would be to ask R2-D2 to support you to Rum, and then support my army to Greece instead. \n\nIf you are game to do that, I\u2019d be happy to take down R2-D2 with you and work with you moving forward. \n\nThoughts?","I will support you to Greece \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7","I see what you are saying about rum I\u2019m just not sure about lying in a game about lying or not","Let me think on it but yes to get that to work he has to not support to Greece \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddf7","I think we can lull him into a sense of calm. I really do. And I think that he will tell one of us the truth, so if you propose it, he will mention it to me and we will know whether he is being honest.","He said yes very quickly ...","Hi Han Solo \u2014 just FYI, I think I\u2019m better off just grabbing the easy build in Tunis this turn, so no need to support me to Greece just yet. Perhaps we can move on R2-D2 next year?","I hope you\u2019ve had a great weekend. Just so you know, I\u2019m secretly hoping you build A Smyrna, F Constantinople. \ud83e\udd1e \ud83e\udd1e","I certainly like that build. Thoughts on how we can work together here?","Hmm I think R2-D2 is moving to Tyrol and coming after you","Not sure but he\u2019s got a lot of units and he does lie","Hi Han Solo,\n\nI am facing a critical decision point here. I\u2019d really like to make a deal with you. \n\nI\u2019ve just learned that R2-D2\/Luke Skywalker have a deal in place to attack you. R2-D2 has promised Luke Skywalker Bulgaria in exchange for Luke Skywalker\u2019s help against you. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that I am R2-D2\u2019s second choice for an ally, and I don\u2019t want to help A\/R take you down just to be their next snack.","The current A\/R plan is for R2-D2 to double support Luke Skywalker to Bulgaria. Moscow is headed up to STP with Sev supporting UKR to BUL. I am supposed to make a surprise move towards Chewbacca. \n\nA\/R expects you to cover Smyrna and does not expect you to attack Sev given all the units surrounding you.","We have a terrific counter, if you\u2019d like to work with me. \n\nI can tap Greece and Aegean, which should allow you to save Bulgaria (Const S Bulgaria holding). At the same time, Black Sea Support Armenia to Sevastopol WILL WORK! I\u2019m planning to move over to Trieste, so the end result of all this would be Han Solo regaining Sev and remaining at 5 while I take Trieste and get to 5. From there, I think we should be able to work together to finish off R2-D2.","I know that\u2019s a lot to take in. I\u2019m sorry to kind of dump all of this on you, but I just learned basically that R2-D2 is prioritizing Luke Skywalker\u2019s growth over mine, and I can see the writing on the wall. I\u2019d very much like to turn the tables on him. Can we do this?","Come talk with me!!!","I\u2019m still hoping to work this out with you. Please drop me a line when you have a free moment.","Hey man, I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019re still there and that you got my messages. I\u2019d really like to speak with you.","I\u2019m getting the impression that you just want to fight with me, and you don\u2019t care what I have to say. If that\u2019s the case, fine. But I do believe there is room for us to work together, so if you\u2019d like to discuss that, drop me a line.","So turns out if you don\u2019t say truth or lie it doesn\u2019t send mail ...","Ha! Yeah, I\u2019ve had that problem too!","So, is it worth us having a discussion this turn? I sincerely wanted to work something out with you last turn, but I took silence to be an ominous sign.","I wasn\u2019t silent","I just didn\u2019t realize no emails went through","Tough break friend.","No worries it\u2019s diplomacy"],"sender_labels":[true,false,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,false,false,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true],"receiver_labels":["NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",false,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",false,true,"NOANNOTATION",false,true,true,true,true],"speakers":["Han Solo","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Han Solo","Yoda","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Yoda","Han Solo","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Han Solo","Han Solo","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Han Solo","Yoda","Yoda","Han Solo","Han Solo","Yoda","Han Solo"],"receivers":["Yoda","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Yoda","Han Solo","Yoda","Yoda","Yoda","Han Solo","Yoda","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Yoda","Yoda","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Han Solo","Yoda","Han Solo","Han Solo","Yoda","Yoda","Han Solo","Yoda"],"absolute_message_index":[45,94,103,150,154,178,192,194,195,196,203,218,337,369,433,434,490,491,492,493,498,503,508,605,651,689,690,804,805,806,807],"relative_message_index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30],"seasons":["Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Winter","Spring","Spring","Spring","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Spring","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Winter","Winter"],"years":["1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903"],"game_score":["3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","3","4","4","5","5","4","4","4","4","4","4","4","5","3","5","5","3","3","6",0],"game_score_delta":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","-1","-1","1","1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","-1","2","-2","2","2","-2","-2","6","-6"],"players":["Yoda","Han Solo"],"game_id":1,"dialogue_id":4,"num_messages":31}
{"messages":["Hello! Thoughts on how you like to play as Yoda?","Hi Chewbacca!\n\nWell, I generally don\u2019t like to play as Yoda at all, frankly. But when I do, I go east. Not sure whether I\u2019ll head towards Han Solo or R2-D2, but I think the one big advantage that you and I both have is that we have a mutual border that is easy to keep clear. \n\nI\u2019m not moving west. It takes forever to get there, and there are rarely centers there for me when I arrive. I hope you feel the same way about moving towards me. \n\nI\u2019d like to keep our border clear and I\u2019d like to act as \u201ctrio wires\u201d for each other. Basically, if either Darth Vader or Obi-Wan Kenobi want to attack you, I expect they\u2019ll mention something to me, and if you\u2019ll look out for me diplomatically, I\u2019ll give you a head\u2019s up if ever you need to worry. \n\nHow do you like to play Chewbacca?","I'm happy to hear that! I have the same opinion when it comes down to our relationship. I prefer to play Chewbacca decisevely in the West when an opportunity presents itself. Since that opportunity might not present itself for a long time, I often times end up playing a bit more reactively.\n\nI'd love to be trio wires. I've heard from everyone in the east, but not much substance, which probably means a bunch of passive openings.  If there's little fighting between the Eastern powers it might make it tougher for us, so hopefully things will shake up a bit in that department. If you are also finding that there isn't a whole lot of commitment going on there, and you have some interest in an unorthodox play, then maybe there is some potential for us to work together directly.","Yeah, everyone is cagey and conservative, at least in words. If you have thoughts on something unorthodox, I love that kind of plan, so I\u2019d love to hear it.","Ha \u2014 I meant \u201ctrip wire\u201d above. That should make more sense.","But I appreciate that you also agreed to be \u201ctrio wires.\u201d \ud83e\udd23","That is funny, I was thinking that trio referred to the 3 Western\/Eastern countries \ud83d\ude02 . In terms of unorthodox plans, I was thinking that if you moved to Tyrolia and Venice it would appear to be an attack on R2-D2, but that we could then perform a joint attack on Munich instead. I'm not sure if you actually want Munich or to get embroiled in Darth Vader, but I thought I'd throw it out there.","Heads up: Obi-Wan Kenobi is sniffing around. Wants to know if I\u2019d be in to move to Piedmont if he takes the Channel.","Thanks for the heads up!","Nothing from Darth Vader suggesting he\u2019s in on it. I think that guy is going to be conservative.","That is really good to know- I wish I had more information on the East to share, but unfortunately I haven't gotten anything back yet.","Hoping we can help each other out this way all game.","I hope so too!","Just from the way the pieces moved, it's looking pretty good for you! What's your read on things?","Oh...I don\u2019t know. Looks like I may be destined to become one of those forever-stuck-on-four Yodas that flounders about for a while and then dies. \ud83d\ude14\n\nDarth Vader seems very passive. You seem aggressive, and pointed away from me, which warms my heart. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the board?","True. Us staying out of each-others way is what allowed me to be a bit more aggressive, so thank you for that \ud83d\ude42. It looks like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are squabbling, which is probably great for R2-D2 who started off very strong. I agree that Darth Vader is a bit passive, and now does not have the option to prevent Luke Skywalker from taking sweden. It's tough to read Obi-Wan Kenobi. You may have some opportunities if everyone is on board with the Lepanto, and could possibly convince R2-D2 to give you a center","I am only using my downward thumb for Darth Vader so far. He keeps telling me transparent lies about you. Lol. \n\nLet\u2019s please never fight. The bad guys are going to try to make us fight. Let\u2019s just not.","Thanks for the heads up. I agree completely. As a side note, do you have a read on Obi-Wan Kenobi by any chance? I want to work with him at this point, but he seems to be on the fence about it.","I haven\u2019t really heard much from him. I think I disappointed him when I said \u201cno thanks\u201d on Piedmont. Let me reach out to him now and see if I can get a read.","I have been presuming that I don\u2019t need to say \u201cA fleet in Marseilles would make my skin crawl,\u201d but maybe I should say it?","In this case, my hand was forced and I had to build armies. I don't anticipate building a fleet in Marseilles (in fact, that turn right there may have been my last build phase ever) but if that changes then I will certainly give you heads up!","Have you and R2-D2 thought about ways to slow down Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Darth Vader in case they decide to alliance and pick  up Scandinavia and Chewbacca dots? I would be fully supportive of an attack on Munich.","I think we have a lot to do in the east before we make that kind of move. Any chance you can get Obi-Wan Kenobi on your side?","True. The east is looking very nice for you and R2-D2 :). I'm working on it but it is tough, and I am of course worried about the fleet London build and Darth Vader building 2 armies. If Obi-Wan Kenobi is no longer asking you to attack me then that would be a good sign.","Well, I\u2019m just a four-center Yoda. Let\u2019s not get too excited yet. \n\nI haven\u2019t heard a thing from Obi-Wan Kenobi in quite a while. No idea what he\u2019s thinking.","Hey- just thought I'd contact you and offer you some centers \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02","I wanted to tell you sooner, but the bot was down.","You just got two thumbs down!","Good luck this turn.","Should we talk builds? I\u2019d like to avoid F Mar.","Sure. I won't build a fleet in Mar.","I'm sure you have plans in the near term already set. Have you put any thought into how you would like the mid game to look like?","Oh...I\u2019m planning on killing both R2-D2 and Han Solo if I can. Though, not sure yet how I\u2019m going to pull it off. Any ideas?","Hmm. I imagine Han Solo falls first. It was smart of you to take Greece so that R2-D2 is the one at the front of the attack. Once R2-D2 has committed deep into Han Solo you should have plenty of opportunities. I think it would be a matter of just waiting for the right time. Luke Skywalker may be interested in working with you since his interests and R2-D2's interests are probably not as aligned in the long term.","The bot is back up \ud83d\ude03","Sorry for the delay. Just looking at the game again now.","Hi friend, are you still there?","Basically, I am getting a bit of an ultimatum from my friends in the east, and I would like to arrange for a feint in your direction this turn, to set up an attack on R2-D2, but I want to share it with you first.","I believe I am getting a build this turn (crossing my fingers), and I plan to build A Ven to set up an invasion of R2-D2.","But that only works if he doesn\u2019t see it coming. So my plan is to use Tyrolia to support hold Munich this turn (it\u2019s the only way to keep that army in Tyr) and to move my fleets to TYS and TUN. Then I build A Ven, and I attack Trieste while R2-D2 heads towards Luke Skywalker and I circle my fleets back around R2-D2.","The one fly in the ointment is that it requires some trust from my light blue friend in the west. I can only hope that we\u2019ve built up enough rapport that you understand where I\u2019m coming from here, and you let me engage in this bit of sleight of hand.","Just saw the moves, and then read your messages. OK- I trust you, but don't fuck me on this. I do have a back up plan, but I'd like to not go there \ud83d\ude01.","I like this response.","You\u2019re going to like my next move set, and you\u2019re not going to need your backup plan.","I think the key here is to get Darth Vader back on your side. Obi-Wan Kenobi is not wavering. He sent me a case of Champaign for my last move.","Thanks- yes, Obi-Wan Kenobi has ceased all communications with me by now","Such a charmer.","Nothing to say after that last turn?","Hey. Sorry. I try to be more communicative. Just a very long day for me yesterday. \n\nYou seem to have sniffed out my attack quite well, and now I\u2019m facing R2-D2 getting 2 builds, while I likely get none. So...bad turn for me, and it may cost me the game. \n\nI stabbed you. There\u2019s no getting around that. Perhaps it is some solace to you that I may have completely yanked my own game in doing so?","It is what it is, a stab on R2-D2 has sailed past for the time being, but with any of these grand alliances there will be another opportunity later (provided that R2-D2 doesn't stab you first). I'm going to do what I believe will maximize my chances of survival, and if that means working with you then I won't hold that grudge. It depends how creative you are willing to get. Given Obi-Wan Kenobi communications with me, I can't imagine that they are easy to work with.","I'd like to float the option of your fleets sailing past mine and into the Mid Atlantic. This obviously runs great risks for myself, but I believe I have a higher chance of survival in the long run this way. I also believe it may be in your best interests as well. You want to get past the stalemate lines, and this is the best way to do it.","Builds are a problem for you. But they will be anyway as you have to make a coin flip guess on Spain\/Marseilles. On the other hand, R2-D2 has two guaranteed builds and more coming. Given the nature of that alliance, I'm sure R2-D2 may be willing to share those builds with you.","I'm in a tough spot, but I also believe in the long run. That's why I want to be clear that I'm not desperate- I won't be selling myself to whoever will support me on any given turn. From my perspective, I just need one unit to be in a draw. So, if there's a slim chance for me to be a one unit survivor in a monster Yoda\/R2-D2 draw, I'll help you and R2-D2 as much as I can.","Any thoughts for me? How would you go about making a Chewbacca-Yoda alliance work?","Hey, so I really appreciate this string of messages.","Just really strong diplomacy. Flexible, fun, mutual advantage seeking. My kind of player.","I will respond to honesty with honesty: I really need a build this turn. I am concerned about two R2-D2n builds setting me up to get stabbed. For that reason, I am very much inclined to take my 50\/50 shot at a Chewbacca center this turn.","On the other hand, I quite like the idea of sending my fleets passed you.","So...I really like your message, and I\u2019m trying to think how it could all work.","But, I don\u2019t know if I can give up my 50\/50 shot at a build. I NEED a build or I likely get stabbed, I\u2019m afraid.","Also, Obi-Wan Kenobi is very much set up to get stabbed by a surprise I\/F here. I mean, that would be super fun.","I will tell you this: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader are both very interested in your demise, and that makes you a more attractive ally for me, as I don\u2019t want to see E\/F grow strong and grow affectionate after breaking bread in Paris.","So I guess what I\u2019m saying is: allow me a build this turn, and I\u2019d be quite happy to push to be in Irish Sea next year.","You might find yourself in a bit of a janissary position, but you won\u2019t have to fear that I\u2019ll just stab you for all your centers because I would be far to early to make a solo run, and I\u2019d just invite backlash from the rest of the board. I\u2019m not a dimwit who strikes out on poorly considered solo runs too early.","(I do it at exactly the right time \ud83e\udd2d)","Thoughts?","Also, it would do you some good to prevent Darth Vader from taking Burgundy this year. My head is spinning a bit from a really fun 1905 in which I support you into Munich and move to North Atlantic on the same turn.","I'm really glad that you are entertaining a plan like this. You call it strong diplomacy, but it only works because you are constantly looking for the best opportunities and going after them. I can get you a build. I thought about ways to do it subtly, but I wonder if it might just be better to go in for it. I can send a fleet from MAO to NAO unopposed. If you get a fleet into MAO, this will set up an unstoppable convoy directly into Clyde. The best way to do this would probably be to have you convoy Piedmont to Spain using the Gulf of Lyons, and use West Med to take MAO, thus allowing a future Spain to Clyde convoy.","I am going to support an attack into Mar or Spa (I will not move to both), but if you move to NAO and keep Darth Vader out of Burgundy, I will absolutely come out guns blazing against Obi-Wan Kenobi next year, and maybe Darth Vader too.","Done. This gets a bit weird since the move is only really effective if you follow me into MAO, and if you tell me that then in theory I know how to defend. So instead of you telling me your moves, I'll just tell you mine. I believe that I can move to NAO, prevent Darth Vader from taking Burundy, and hit Marseilles with a force of two all at once. This move set will leave Spain and MAO unguarded and you will be able to walk in to both. If you choose to do that, I believe we can guarantee Liverpool next year.","My best guess is that Darth Vader will try to take Belgium this turn, and if she does ideally that build will be a fleet. My gut feeling is that while Darth Vader may not like me very much, she seems to trust you. If you work your diplomatic magic I think she would be happy to build a fleet and attack Obi-Wan Kenobi with her fleets.","Hmmmm, I need to stop giving you thumbs ups. You\u2019re ruining my truth detector score.","Kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won\u2019t hold it against you. You\u2019re in a tough spot.","Well maybe not, since it was a truth when I sent it out. But it seemed like you were not interested in going to the mid Atlantic ocean based on your messages, and I felt like it would be pointless to go to NAO if you were not headed to MAO. The other part of the equation was the fact that I offered you Spain for free- and you passed that up in favor of a guess. Maybe you didn't trust me, but it got me thinking about why you would pass on a deal like that.","Also, given the moves you attacked both Spain and Marseilles, moved out of Tyrolia, and Darth Vader did not attack Burgundy. So there's also that \ud83d\ude06","I get that there was a better way to handle this. And I should have let you know that the move to NAO was off. I really am sorry about that. But you have to know that I was 100% serious about attacking Obi-Wan Kenobi with you. I make crazy unnexpected plays like that all the time in high stakes Diplomacy games, so for a game that's more of a beta test than game, it's natural. And we can still do it too. I'd love to hear your suggestions on how to make it stick, and it's something Darth Vader is certainly interested in as well.","I\u2019m giving you a bunch of these \ud83d\udc4e for those comments.","You made a deal with me, and did something else instead. That doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t consider another deal, but I don\u2019t want you to think that is lost on me.","Hey look- I know your upset. I hope you can see things from my point of view though. I was in the heat of the moment and I really really really wanted this to work. It would be so fun, and I could finally get back at Obi-Wan Kenobi for being a total piece of crap. And then I sobered up and read between the lines, and realized how terrible your deal would be for me as it turns out you weren't actually offering me anything. I wanted to work with you so badly I had convinced myself to make awful moves. So if you want to downvote all my messages, you can kiss your truth telling ratio good bye. Keep it up and it will be lower than mine \ud83d\ude18.","Well, let me know if you want to talk about anything else.","And by the way, I think the deal I offered was pretty good for you \u2014 much better than doing nothing. It did not give you anything in the short-term, but that was because I had a short-term need and no reason to make a sacrifice to you to get a deal done. I proposed a deal that was good for me because I intended to follow through.","You may get better proposals from others, but not better proposals that they intend to actually follow through on.","Seems like you\u2019ve decided to write me off as someone who can be useful to you, and so you\u2019re going to spread lies to others about me instead.","That stuff gets back to me.","You don\u2019t owe me anything. And I attacked you, so I won\u2019t begrudge you your vengeance. But that said, I was pretty darn sincere when I said I thought there was a way forward for us.","All I wanted from you was for us to kill Obi-Wan Kenobi first. Get you past the stalemate lines and then you can circle back for Chewbacca dots. I even offered you Spain for free. If you really were interested in something like this, you would not only have your build, but be in Clyde.\n\nThat's the thing though- you don't want to be there. You want ME to be there so that you can keep pretending to be on Obi-Wan Kenobi's side. And you want your units to be in Chewbacca.\n\nI don't doubt you were sincere. But launching an ineffective attack on Obi-Wan Kenobi while Yoda eats me from behind in the hopes that eventually Yoda soloes even though he's going to get stopped at the stalemate lines because Yoda just has to be friends with Obi-Wan Kenobi? Not a fan. If there's a way forward it's with you sending a fleet to MAO and putting your fleets past the lines. Or it's with you withdrawing and finally stabbing R2-D2 like you said you would a few years ago.\n\nAll you've done so far is build an EG alliance and waste both of our time in the med. With all your grand talk, I just thought you had a better plan than this.","At the very least you should be trying to get Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader to fight. At this rate they will continue to get Chewbacca dots while you still are stuck at 0. You have so many units on the Western front that it honestly makes no sense for you to share spoils with EG.","I appreciate the advice. If I feel like you sincerely want to work with me, I\u2019ll be much more inclined to encourage Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader to fight. Honestly, I\u2019m quite sure that you and I, working together, could accomplish that very quickly. But lately I\u2019m learning that you\u2019re mostly trying to get people to distrust me.","So, I think we\u2019re going to have some trouble bridging this gap.","If you\u2019d like to give your centers to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader a kind of payback to me, that\u2019s certainly within your power. It\u2019s not how I\u2019d like this game to go, but there may be satisfaction in that for you,","Ok, I get that you are concerned by me \"spreading rumors,\" but you and I haven't exactly been working together, so I feel like trying to get Obi-Wan Kenobi to stop attacking me is a fair message to send. Maybe you don't know this, but I've sent Obi-Wan Kenobi a message every season for the past 9 or 10 seasons and they have ignored each message. In fact, I'm so glad you told me about this since it proves that Obi-Wan Kenobi is reading my messages and just not responding to them.","You seem to have interpreted this as some kind of vengeance against you. That's not the case. I'm literally just trying to survive here.","And while I can't confirm it, I heavily suspect you have your own little group with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader where you all slander me plenty \ud83d\ude09 .","Well, you have choices about who to work with. Let me know if you ever get serious about working with me.","Anyway, I\u2019m just going to keep flipping a coin over Marseilles or Spain. One day I\u2019ll guess it right.","I think the best way to work together at this point is an Yoda withdrawal. The good thing is that this is pretty easy. If you move to Ionian you can convoy Piedmont to Greece\/Albania.","The reason why is that Obi-Wan Kenobi has already brought their fleets around and even if we could get you into the MAO they've already set up a line that we would struggle immensely to cross.","At some point Obi-Wan Kenobi Channel will plug up Irish Sea and NWG will go to NAO. What I'm saying is that it's too late, the opportunity is gone.","Maybe if Darth Vader turns on Obi-Wan Kenobi. But is that even possible at this point? Just looking at the board and the moves, I think they are along for the full ride.","Obviously you can potentially gain if you keep attacking me. But I think that's Gambler's fallacy. Actually, you won't \"one day guess it right\". Theoretically, it's possible for me to ALWAYS be right.","That\u2019s not the gambler\u2019s fallacy. And it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that if I keep flipping a coin, one of these days it will turn up heads.","If you\u2019d like to work with me, all you need to do is leave either Spain or Marseilles open, and tell me which one. I\u2019ll take one build, and the two of us will round the corner.","And you won't take any of my other centers until we wipe out Obi-Wan Kenobi?At the moment I'm defending both.","It's not unreasonable at all. Just Chewbacca happens to be tough to kill, and compounded onto that I'm a very lucky person \ud83d\ude09.","If you are using your units to move towards Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I feel I can trust you, I\u2019m not going to take your other centers. That would be foolish of me to do.","Hmm. Any way we can do this without having me go down a unit? If you move to MAO I'm pretty sure you'll get in.","That just isn\u2019t a good deal for me. Everything on the board says I should work with Obi-Wan Kenobi against you (and so I plan to give him MAO). If I think I have a loyal Chewbacca who wants to do something fun, I\u2019m willing to shake things up. But without that, I\u2019m not just going to call off my attack.","Nice moves. You made the right call.","Well thank you. You won 3 coin flips in a row, so the congratulations is for you. I was bound to get lucky eventually.","I do appreciate some of the misdirection stuff that you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll mention it after the game, but good stuff.","I think your play had to be to try to get R2-D2 to stab me on one of the last few turns, but it didn\u2019t quite work out.","Thanks. You saw right through it, so it didn't actually end up helping \ud83d\ude02. Yeah, I was hoping to stall this out for longer, but at this point I've got to choose a side and throw to them. Me moving to NAO was an olive branch short of giving you a free dot.","Yeah, if I were you, I would have approached it the same way. You did hold out longer than most would, getting triple teamed, but you needed someone elsewhere on the board to see that it was bad for them for you to fall.","If I get a say in how my dots are distributed, I'd like them to go to you and Darth Vader. I'm not sure how good your relationship with Darth Vader is, but put in a good word for you with them. Whatever the case, you've set this game up brilliantly to the point where I would not be surprised to see you solo.","You are cordially welcomed to distribute dots to me at any time and for any reason.","And I like Darth Vader too.","If you are interested in retreating to Irish, I would take support to the Channel in Fall if you\u2019ll offer it. Could be interesting.","Sure actually. Changed my retreat to the Irish.","Cool!","If you are interested, we can move Marseilles up into Burgundy as well.","Well, that would be amazing for me. So, this is exactly the sort of creative arrangement I was talking about earlier. \n\nMAO - Channel\nWES - MAO\nMar - Bur\nPie - Mar\nLYO S Pie - Mar","Is Darth Vader going to keep Paris?","Yeah I think Darth Vader probably will given the situation. Very awesome orders, I am all for it.","I kind of love these orders.","They are not what anyone will expect. And I can play them off as both pro-Darth Vader and pro-Obi-Wan Kenobi.","Are we still okay with the Channel plan? Darth Vader has been asking me about it, and it seems like she doesn\u2019t like the plan. I\u2019m also nervous about her tipping off Obi-Wan Kenobi. Do we really need to run everything by her?","I am. I won't share any other info with Darth Vader- I figured she'd want to know about the plan before it happened but I think it just made her more worried.","Cool. Thank you.","Here are my orders this turn. If you\u2019d like to grant me Spain, I\u2019ll raise Hell with that build, but I\u2019m okay with you hanging onto it right now if you support me to Channel. \n\nMAO - Channel\nLYO - Spa\nWES S LYO - Spa\nMar - Bur\nPie - Mar","Sounds good. I'm not much use to you without supply centers, so for now I plan to support Spain to hold. Moving West Med to MAO may be a good idea since then you could get more fleets in action.","Hmmm, both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader are sniffing around trying to get my moves. What should I tell them?","Eh, sorry. I got a good offer from the bad guys.","My plan has changed.","Haha, it was too late to change my orders, but it hardly would have mattered. It is not yet clear what you get out of that deal, but I guess it will be apparent to me next year. Surprised if you were going to stab me that you didn't go for Portugal with MAO.","Yeah, I just figured that you might keep your last unit alive as a janissary if I kept Portugal blue.","You played well this game, and frankly, one of the reasons I attacked you was that you seemed like you\u2019d outplay me eventually if you were given room to breath.","I respect and appreciate if you want to hold out in Portugal or Gascony. But if you\u2019d like to keep playing, one option would be to keep Irish on the board, and then support me to NAO in Spring. Then we take a shot at Liverpool. I desperately need fleets on that side of MAO, so if you keep helping me, I have every reason in the world to keep Portugal blue.","I was thinking about keeping Irish for sure. I don't have home centers so I have all the incentive in the world to help you and Darth Vader as much as I can. That makes things completely safe for you and Darth Vader as I have no benefit from gaining another dot. Another option is to keep Picardy with the goal of popping Brest and taking the Channel. Thanks for the kind words, though I think you shouldn't have worried about me too much. Somewhere along the line I kind of majorly pissed off Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I think Darth Vader probably works with them against me due to having only 1 fleet at the time. So I would have been fighting a 2V1 anyway if you had done your own thing in the East.","The ultimate fun would a convoy of Spain to Liverpool in the Spring!","So, thoughts on where to go from here?","Perhaps you\u2019d like support to Brest?","I\u2019m going to go ahead and plug in that support. Though, possible that Obi-Wan Kenobi might cut it.","Already ordered! Not sure if you and Darth Vader are coordinating, but when I spoke with her she said she wanted me to move to Brest to pop the Obi-Wan Kenobi fleet as well.","Yes. We talked it through. \ud83d\ude0a","Hello brother \u2014 How are things going in Brest?","Not bad. Haven't had anyone tell me what I'm supposed to do there so I guess I'm just holding","Well that\u2019s an interesting thing to say.

And why the deception of Han Solo? I'm no expert but to me these moves indicate you don't really trust Yoda at all?","I want to keep Han Solo guessing and off-kilter.","So the bounce was just to conceal your true relationship with Yoda?","Essentially, yes.","What's your plan in the Balkans this season? I was wondering about putting some pressure on Luke Skywalker by having me move into Silesia while you move into Galicia?","I don't want to pressure Luke Skywalker too much until the Turk is taken care of, I don't think it makes sense for me to antagonize them both.","I thought your answer might be that. Makes sense, carry on.","Not sure if this is obvious, but Luke Skywalker indicated to me that they are prioritizing defending Rumania over Ankara, in case that changes your and Yoda's plans for that region. Congrats by the way on crushing Han Solo","Thanks for the notice. I figure one or the other has gotta work first, and then the second will work once the first has.","It seems Yoda is finally showing their true colors. Care to join the dark side?","I'm sure you're already on top of this, but if we can all recognize Yoda as the enemy, then your best bet right now is to try and team up with Luke Skywalker. Maybe offer to disband Arm, Bla, and Gal in exchange for support from Vie into Bud? I am wholly committed to cutting any attempted disrupts from Tyr","*support from Vie for Rum into Bud","Actually, might be better to dissolve Rum instead of Bla and let Gal into Bud","At any rate, here's a direct quote to me from Luke Skywalker: \"And, yes, I'll happily support him [meaning you, R2-D2] to Budapest if he ever fecking starts talking to me again.\"","What's your train of thought on the draw?","I've already submitted my \"moves\", marked myself down for the 5-way draw, and checked \"adjudicate once all players have submitted\".

Aside from that, I'd of course love to be able to pick up Sweden, and if there's anything particular we can discuss to stay at least positively-neutral toward each other, let me know!","Privyet--I won't trouble you in Sweden or Sil\/Pru if you don't trouble me in Denmark. Meanwhile, I was wondering if you agree with me that this game has just a little too much R2-D2 in it?","That sounds fair enough - and I'll pretty much always agree that there should generally only be one Darth Vader, unified.","Are you nervous at all about defending Sweden from Obi-Wan Kenobi?","Of course I am -it's just not my top concern. \ud83d\ude00","well no kidding: you and Han Solo have quite a little spat going. Was just curious if you and Obi-Wan Kenobi had any kind of agreement in place or if you might be wanting my help in a couple seasons","Meh. Most likely outcome is I get sev back in exchange for black, and R2-D2 decides the date of rum. That area's still fluid. And sure I might want help looking North in a season or two. Lemme just straighten that southern mess first.","Obi-Wan Kenobi told me you're assisting them to take Denmark this year. Is this true? Would you consider not doing that?","Sorry, did not see your message until this morning","I have, as you may have noticed, ceased all support of Obi-Wan Kenobi in harassing you","Noted and appreciated. Can\u2019t help but notice you\u2019re in marvelous position to try and swipe Berlin though?","Hahaa, no. I already regret the damage I've done to you, and have no desire to exacerbate it.","Well the feeling is mutual. I wanted to let you know that R2-D2 asked for my help putting pressure on Warsaw. I don't intend to do that, but I recommend you use Silesia to support your Rumanian unit into Galicia. I promise not to interfere with this maneuver if you promise to keep your baltic fleet focused on defending Sweden from Obi-Wan Kenobi?","(Assuming, as I have, that you consider Rumania a lost cause at this point. No offense meant if you don't I'm still pretty new at this game)","Eventually, if he presses it hard enough. Ankara is the more immediate loss. Now it's just a matter of seeing how patient he is pressing in on me, while Yoda becomes a softer target of he keeps pressing West.","sorry, who do you mean by 'he'?","R2-D2, the only one who can press Rumania. \ud83d\ude00","Ah right okay. Well, do let me know if there's anything I can do to help? Esp. if you're willing to support me into Denmark this year, and then I could support you into Sweden in the fall?","Hate to be a bother but I'm not going to have much time to strategerize tomorrow...","You and me both - I literally just got home and logged in.  One sec...","Damn, that's a hard one to weigh.  It's objectively the right move, just not sure how much I want to *cement* being in a fight with him, vs the slim chance he's actually going to do the holding pattern he claims.","Yeah, I think on balance I have to give him the option to follow through, and have a reason to deescalate with me so he can join the dogpile on Chewbacca.  Odds are high I'm going to regret the decision and end up offering you that support in the Fall when you can't reciprocate, but I gotta take the chance with R2-D2 obviously spoiling for a fight.","That makes sense. I do think Obi-Wan Kenobi will follow through, anyway.","To be clear, you mean the same 'holding pattern' you two had last year, right? I just want to confirm so I can feel secure that neither Obi-Wan Kenobi nor you will try to swipe Kiel from me this season","lol - yes, basically repeating by arrangement the same moves we did last turn *without agreement* - fecker tried to dot me \ud83d\ude03","Are you and Obi-Wan Kenobi planning to high-five in Sweden and Norway again this turn? \nI still think supporting Rumania into Gal from Sil is a good move for you. It's getting to the point where (if I'm able to rebuild a unit this winter) I think it'd be worth teaming up to knock R2-D2 down a peg","Stop reading my orders!","And, yeah, I shoulda gone with my gut last turn to support Ank - Con, but in the long run didn't really matter - they'd eventually guess right on those two dots \ud83d\ude03","Yeah there's nothing you can really do when two powers team up so seamlessly like that. You're still doing much better than me, though!","Obi-Wan Kenobi has been talking with me about a Luke Skywalker-Darth Vader-Obi-Wan Kenobi alliance, and I agree with them that it's the only thing that makes sense in the face of the R2-D2-Yoda powerhouse. I assume Obi-Wan Kenobi's been speaking with you as well, and just wanted to confirm the three of us are on the same page. \n\nOn that note, the moves I have planned for this year are all geared towards attacking the west, but I am happy to change my plans if you want some support or coordination to the east.","Yes, I'm all about fecking with R2-D2-Yoda right now. \ud83d\ude00","Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help!","Yoda told me they're not planning on staying in Vienna. Are they going to give it to you? (I admit that my main interest here is finding out if Munich is safe this season)","I'm not touching Munich, but he hasn't said anything to me about Vienna","Well you'd be silly not to take it, unless you have assurance from R2-D2 or Yoda that they're not supporting each other to hold vienna","Would you be interested in visiting Tyrolia? It's lovely this time of year...","To be clear, I'm offering to support that move if you agree with me that Yoda needs to be stopped.","Quite likely. \ud83d\ude00","Well, I'll let you mull that over, and add another suggestion: \nWould you be willing to support one of Gal or Rum into Bud from Vie?\n\nAlso, me and Obi-Wan Kenobi are on the same page about one thing: despite the seizure of Sweden, we're not trying to invade your territory any further until Yoda is dealt with. But we needed Obi-Wan Kenobi to have a build in case Yoda made landfall on the British Isle.","Yeah, I already preemptively cursed at him but noted I understood he needed the build.  \n And, yes, I'll happily support him to Budapest if he ever fecking starts talking to me again. He hasn't responded to me in more than two years","Losing three dots changes a person; they'll come around.","War changes you.","Operation Flat Tyr is a go.","Awesome. Any news from R2-D2? They\u2019ve not responded to me","Yeah, he's gotten quite chatty with me this turn.

{"messages":["Guten Tag! Wanted to touch base about your plans for this year.","your destruction, mostly. but plans can change","Nobody makes it far without friends in this game. I suppose you're hoping to be friends with Chewbacca then?","I don't consider it wise to put stock in any friendship until it's proven. However, I tend to trust people more if they are willing to give me some information before asking it from me","Well, that makes two of us then. You're welcome to ask a specific question if you have one though.","Alright then. What are your plans for the North Sea these days?","I'll be moving there this spring. Just doing a pretty standard northern opening. You taking the fleet to Holland or Denmark (or somewhere else)?","My fleet is Holland-bound. Pleasure doing business \ud83d\ude03","Alright, thanks for letting me know. I'd also like to talk about me going to Belgium. I imagine this is something a bit less amenable to you, but maybe something we could bargain over?","Well, now the Belgium discussion changes a bit. Chewbacca has this secured unless we collaborate in opposition. Also, I can prevent your move to Denmark.","I'd be amenable to that. To be clear, Would you want me to move my fleet to Belgium while your North Sea fleet supports?","So I could do this, but to secure the move you would also have to cut the support from Bur that Chewbacca will likely give to move Pic to Bel. You can just attack Bur from Mun to do this. Also, providing this support is a bit of a favor and might put me at odds with Chewbacca. Would you be willing to offer Denmark to sweeten the deal for me?","how can you take Denmark while also supporting me from the north sea?","Oh I'm talking about next year. Should have clarified. But this would require you keeping out this year.","I'm sorry, but why? Why couldn't I hold it for this Winter and then dip in the Spring to let you in?","I'd sooner keep Denmark and let you be the one to occupy Belgium, if that's preferable (i.e. support your North sea fleet moving there)","The reason is because I'd need your support into denmark to be sure Luke Skywalker couldn't bump me out. And it's putting a lot of trust in you to expect you'll just clear the way for me.","Well so what do you think of my counter offer, then?","I certainly appreciate it. The only issue is that it still doesn't guarantee Belgium for me. Chewbacca may support Bur from Pic instead, and then it would be a bounce.","I have it on, admittedly, Yoda authority that Chewbacca is trying to make a play for Munich from Burgundy. But even if that weren't the case, vacating burgundy would leave Marseilles vulnerable to me. So I think the only option for Chewbacca that wouldn't be Pyrrhic is to move from Pic","That's fair. At the least I'd like to keep Chewbacca out of Belgium, even if I don't end up with it.","Also I had to look up Pyrrhic haha","haha -- so, do we have a deal, then? I'll attack Burgundy while supporting your move to belgium, and you'll let me take Denmark this turn?","Yes, we have a deal.","Your holland fleet supports Nth to Bel and I stay out of Denmark this turn.","you have a healthy sense of distrust and I respect that. But I appreciate you not trying to keep me out of Denmark nonetheless.","Also, do you have thoughts on how we might collaborate next year? What are your goals, and what are your concerns?","You\u2019re giving me too much credit. I forgot to click submit on my order for the north sea or something. Was surprised myself to see a hold there. So why did you back out of the deal then?","Preferred to see Chewbacca there.","I can understand why you might have made that move, but I think it\u2019s actually bad for both of us. Even if you and Chewbacca team up to knock me out, Chewbacca will get the better part of that deal and will then work with Luke Skywalker to take you down.","If I work with Chewbacca, we\u2019ll bring Luke Skywalker in on it (who needs some help after what happened with Han Solo). This looks good for all three of us, and very bad for you.","The last option is for us to work together against Chewbacca. On the one hand, this is a good move because Chewbacca is a strong player in a strong position. On the other hand, how am I supposed to trust you at all to cooperate?","Real talk: I was given bad information that you and Chewbacca were working together last round, which does not seem to be the case, but that's why I didn't follow through on our deal. I am well positioned now to take Belgium, and I can see now that, as you say, it would be much easier on me to ally with you rather than try to take you down even with Chewbacca's help. But I can understand if you don't want to trust me.","I was working with Chewbacca, and I still have a positive relationship with Chewbacca. We agreed to stay out of the Obi-Wan Kenobi channel, and Chewbacca had agreed to support me into belgium. But this was about hedging my bets, not working against you. And you see how that played out haha.","Chewbacca would love for me to be an ally in taking you out of the game over the next couple of years. They\u2019ve been talking about convincing Luke Skywalker to help with the takedown.","A joint stab against Chewbacca would require a high level of collaboration on our end. Something like an agreement to essentially act as one country up until a certain year. Sharing all planned moves, following up on them etc. So this would be my condition for working together.","I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose Chewbacca as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?","*choose me as an ally over Chewbacca","So my reasoning is that I think Chewbacca is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help Chewbacca, Chewbacca probably beats me. If we defeat Chewbacca together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.","So basically Chewbacca is too smart to be left alive and the world ought to belong to us idiots \ud83d\ude02","What about Luke Skywalker?","Haha yeah that was kind of my thinking. Luke Skywalker is a little tied up in the south, and so I don't expect aggression in the north. However, Chewbacca would respond to a stab by begging for Luke Skywalkern (and potentially R2-D2n and Yoda) assistance. So the choice next year is between containing Luke Skywalker or being aggressive (which would mean going for sweden or St. P). I think the builds we see this winter will make it more clear what's possible.","Speaking of, what are your planned builds? I'm building a fleet in London.","Armies in Kiel and Munich","What are your plans for your north sea and London fleets?\n\nI'm trying to decide now how best to handle Belgium and that is going to depend on whether Chewbacca is concerned with defending Brest or if instead they expect help from you in disrupting anything I try to do from Holland. \n\n...I can offer you support in moving into Sweden in exchange for supporting my Burgundy troops into Belgium? Is that worth more than whatever Chewbacca might be offering you right now?","Any thoughts on my offer?\nI have another proposal if you\u2019re interested","Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're killin me here.","Hey sorry. Busy evening for me. Let me think a second and respond to all this..","Ok so for one thing Chewbacca isn't exactly offering me anything, so there's no real comparison of your offer vs theirs.","My once concern about the full-on Chewbacca stab would be that the job couldn't be done quickly enough. We could force Bel this year, but we unfortunately wouldn't be able to put Chewbacca down a unit because Spa is a guarantee for Chewbacca. This may even allow for a rebuild in Bre if the Belgian army gets dislodged.","That's where my new plan comes in!","Ok what's the sitch","You move fleets to Eng, Ska, and Nth this turn. Yoda moves to Pie. I move Hol-Bel, Kie-Ruh, Bur-Gas, Mun-Bur. Now, Chewbacca might foresee me attempting to take Gas, but more likely they want to dislodge me from Bur. This puts them in a position where they will have to lose one of Paris, Belgium, Marseilles, or Brest, and will not be able to vacate the others for building season.","Chewbacca could stop by bumping Par and Mar in Gas right? And you're suggesting my moves a setup of going against Luke Skywalker?","Also, have you talked to Yoda about this?","Damn--I didn't think of the bumping. (sorry, this is just my first game and I'm still learning). And yeah I thought you'd want to grab Sweden because why not? \n\nI haven't discussed the full plan, but they seemed amenable to moving to pie","Okay how about this:","Keep your fleets in NWG and NTH, but move to ENG. Have NTH support HOL-BEL. \nI'll attack BUR-PIC, move KIE-RUH, MUN-BUR. If Chewbacca does a Gascon Bounce, They'll have to lose either Brest or Paris or Marseilles. If they try to dislodge me instead, I'll retreat to Gascony. \nYou still get my support to march on Sweden in Fall if desired.","Keep in mind that Munich is vulnerable. Yoda and R2-D2 may have a deal in the works for that. But this is the sort of plan that I had thought through originally.","This would be a break of my DMZ with Chewbacca in the channel. Which is why the success of a stab like this is especially important.","well ya could have saved me some brain cells by sharing it in the first place! \ud83d\ude1b  \nAnd Yoda and R2-D2, unless they're lying, think of me as an ally. That said, my plan doesn't actually involve vacating Munich","Oh fair, because you're not actually moving into Pic, you're just cutting the support. I had you moving from Bur to Bel. Dislodging the Chewbacca army from Bel could result in a disband. And if we don't get an additional supply center could mean a rebuild in Brest, which would be bad for me (adding Spain is probably a given). Have you considered the potential support of Mar from Spa s.c. ?","Yeah if my calculations are correct the Chewbacca home supply centers hold. First move is to bounce in Gas to keep you out, then move spain to s.c. and lose bel. Next move is to support hold in mar from spain s.c. and then bounce paris to brest to keep me out. Bre, Par, and Mar all hold in the fall.","OK, Marseilles might be a no-go this round then. \n\nIf you don't want a rebuild in Brest, we'll simply attack Picardy and force a retreat to Brest by an army. Not so bad for your fleet, right? I'll move into Paris from BUR","wait I mean A retreat to burgundy by that army. Then the Parisian Army will be in brest, so no rebuild will occur","Well, it kind of becomes rock paper scissors there. If I try to go into Brest it's a bounce and it remains open. If I don't, and Chewbacca takes the risk of not going (probably won't happen) then it would stay open too.","Sounds like you'd like the belgian army to disband though. I understand, as it could help somebody out to take munich from Ruh.","whoa dude I just want a supply center don't go talking about people invading the fatherland\n\nSo are you saying no deal, then?","No, I'm just echoing your probable reasoning for wanting the disband of the belgian army rather than its retreat to Ruh.","I don't see what that has to do with you, though? Like what difference does it make to you whether that army disbands or retreats to Ruh?","The disband allows for a rebuild, if there's an open home supply center and Chewbacca still has 5 total. So this could mean building a fleet in Brest.","ohhh I see. So what you're saying is you'd accept the deal if I didn't arrange for the disband and allowed a retreat to Ruh?","Let me sleep on it. I may be fine regardless. I'll confirm moves in the morning. But for this plan, Spring looks like your support into Sweden and my support into Belgium. I'll be very curious to see moves from Luke Skywalker-Yoda-R2-D2. If they all converge in on you, this could be trouble. I doubt that level of collaboration is going to happen though.","hang on would you be willing to postpone your sweden march until Fall? I'm not so keen on forcing Luke Skywalker into the baltic","You'd still hold sweden by winter","Yeah that would be fair. Just need to run it by Luke Skywalker that norway is a hold in the spring so that doesn\u2019t raise any eyebrows","Well, or you could march into Finland just to spice things up","Well Obi-Wan Kenobi you've taught me an important lesson","This isn\u2019t a full stab. I\u2019m sorry for the deception though. I hadn\u2019t heard whether Yoda was anti-Chewbacca. Now I have. I\u2019m taking Denmark this year with Luke Skywalkern support. I\u2019m sorry for that too. Kiel can\u2019t save it. I\u2019d suggest you bounce kiel and munich in Ruh and then attack holland from belgium to cut support . This will hold the line (unless Chewbacca decides to let you into belgium, which would be unlikely).","I know you don\u2019t want to take advice from me, but you\u2019re kind of in survival mode now. We can talk about belgium for you next year to get you back on your feet.","Obi-Wan Kenobi, I have 0.0 reason to trust your advice regarding Chewbacca. You're so clearly working with them!","I think the tactical suggestion stands on its own though. You can work through the rules to verify it makes sense (and should, in case i\u2019m making a mistake). Also I don\u2019t know Chewbacca\u2019s moves this season. And you should ping Yoda to talk about me.","Nice! I guess you knew what you were doing.","well not really--I just assumed that attacking a convoying fleet would disrupt the convoy and that was apparently wrong","Yeah you have to dislodge. But you held ruhr! And my way wouldn\u2019t have worked actually. That\u2019s a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium (i think). Can only be broken if i support it. Of course Chewbacca could choose to let you in to ruhr as well","Hi, not sure what you heard from Yoda. Looking forward to the three of us working against Chewbacca though. Let me know where you\u2019re at with this. I\u2019d help you into belgium this year.","Okay, I\u2019m down to cooperate.","Ok. All i need from you in the spring is to not attack Nth. Then i\u2019ll support myself into the channel. Then i support you into belgium in the fall. And i don\u2019t touch holland, kiel, or berlin. And Luke Skywalker doesn\u2019t either. Maybe we get Yoda to move to Pie?","Hi. I\u2019m guessing the move to HEL was to cut support. Should have let you know I was moving out. Are you still interested in collaboration for survival? We\u2019re both a bit threatened right now.","Hi\u2014yeah, because of bot troubles I never got reassured last turn that you wouldn\u2019t support, say, Chewbacca into belgium or something. So now here we are! Chewbacca asked me to bump Nth to cut your channel support, just fyi","To be clear I don\u2019t intend to do that since I basically need everyone to fall back to keep my holdings this turn.\nDo you have any clue what Luke Skywalker\u2019s plans are?","Not sure what Luke Skywalker will do, but I\u2019d be a little concerned about berlin being surrounded. I won\u2019t be attacking Kiel so your support will go through from there.","Does Chewbacca think you\u2019ll be cutting support? Also, Yoda has been sending some anti-Chewbacca things my way. A three-on-one alliance could be good for all of us. Containing Luke Skywalker may distract both of us if he gets aggressive.","I told Chewbacca (truthfully) that I couldn't cut your support this turn","Cool. Do you need me to cut support in BAL or do you have that covered with Munich support?","Also, Yoda is on board with a stab against Chewbacca.","Yoda told me that, too. And actually, if I could count on you to cut BAL support, it would free up Kiel to try and defend Ruhr from Chewbacca for a turn. However, if you're using that denmark fleet for something else just let me know","So I have kind of a crazy idea. I'm curious what you'd think of this.","What if I let you into Denmark and I go for Sweden?","Well, if Chewbacca goes for Holland I'd be in a slightly strategically worse position.","I was thinking you'd go from Kiel and bounce Holland with the HEL fleet. Then you get your build in Kiel","that wouldn't work because I need kiel to support berlin, i think?","Is Munich occupied doing something else? Yoda told me he has no plans of cutting support there.","Oh I guess Bur can do that though...","that was my fear...","Hmm... Yeah it may be safe to not do that then. Maybe next year. I may go for Sweden regardless. But if Luke Skywalker sees it coming and goes in, that could be a bit annoying","But without action, Luke Skywalker probably takes Ank this fall and builds in Stp.","Is it worth losing the channel this turn? because you could take sweden for sure if you were willing to use nth to convoy","Nth can't convoy to Sweden. SKA is in the way.","doesn't need to. just convoy to norway and move your fleet from norway to sweden. then attack the baltic fleet from denmark. that way you don't lose norway","BAL could move to sweden to bounce. only way to guarantee would be to support from Denmark","ah crap you're right. sorry, wish I could help but all I have are land troops","No worries. I'll give it a shot regardless. And if I do get the extra build, I can provide some serious support to your moves west","Things are getting a little rowdy haha. The good news is that we both outlasted Han Solo!","RIP.","go team!","you held the channel! but no sweden yet...","Yeah. I think the bounce there will be a start of negotiations with Luke Skywalker. Clearly we were both on the same page.","And you got holland back!","ach but now there's Chewbacca in ruhr that'll be a pain","A bit. Chewbacca starts to crumble when I don't have to support my fleet anymore, which is when Yoda forces Chewbacca to go south with its MAO fleet. Then I can start supporting your moves and we can get you into belgium, etc.","Are you gonna try for sweden again this season? Chewbacca told me that they're not moving their Mid-Atlantic fleet and instead would prefer to oust you from the channel. \n\nYoda gave me the idea of supporting your Welsh troops to convoy into Belgium. But if I did would you mind giving it to me in the Fall? I could be way more useful to you if I could build another unit this winter","(I told Chewbacca I'd interrupt your support from Nth in exchange for Chewbacca letting me take belgium next round, but at this point I almost don't think of Belgium as being theirs to give, hence I'd rather work with you)","Luke Skywalker and I plan to repeat the Sweden bounce. If that's to be trusted, this frees up Kiel and Munich.","I'm happy to give you belgium. My idea of the split is you get Bel and Par, I get Bre and Por, and Yoda gets Mar and Spa. Obviously this won't all happen this year. But you in Bel makes sense long-term","The convoy makes me a bit nervous because if Chewbacca goes to IRI, they'll get a home supply center in the fall.","Okay, no convoy then. \n\nHow do you feel about reneging with Luke Skywalker? If you moved into the baltic instead of bouncing and I moved into Denmark (this is also insurance in case I can't end up with Belgium this year), I could support you into sweden in the fall?","I'd prefer to keep neutral with Luke Skywalker, as fighting a war on two fronts would be a lot for me. Belgium isn't guaranteed for you this year, but I think it's likely. Chewbacca will have to respect the pressure in the south from Yoda. This frees me up to cut support in Pic and support you in from Nth. Then you just have to cut support in Ruh and Bur (if there's still something there in the fall).","If Chewbacca is honest with me, Ruhr will be free and Bur will be occupied. \n\nLet's be real here, though: Luke Skywalker has at most two units to spare to threaten you, and likely not even that given the imminent pressure from R2-D2. I'm trying to work it out in the sandbox now but I really don't think they'd be an issue for you...","Luke Skywalker can support into Norway once he's in Sweden, and NTH won't be free to stop that.","Okay that checks out. Thanks for your patience!\n\n...I was thinking of asking Luke Skywalker to support me into denmark this turn and offer to support them into sweden next season. I'm doing this a) to confirm for you that they're on board with the bump as you say, and b) to show that I'd like to work to build trust with them. However, if Luke Skywalker already knows you and I are working together this will establish the opposite of trust. So I guess I'm asking if you think this is a good\/useful idea, and also asking what Luke Skywalker knows about our plans?","Luke Skywalker can only suspect that we're working together at this point. I haven't given any indication of collaboration. I'd say ask away.","Are you definitely committed to not cutting support in Nth?","I really, really am. Maybe I'm just not creative enough, but because of my alliance with Yoda, who is in turn strongly allied with R2-D2, I just don't see myself ever getting anywhere in this game unless I can expand westward into Chewbacca. Hence, even though you're honestly scarier right now I'm inclined to be on your side for the foreseeable future. \nNow, you could just go copy-paste this message to Chewbacca and I'd be royally screwed, so I hope that helps you believe you can trust me.","Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i\u2019ll confirm I am totally anti-Chewbacca until Chewbacca is out of the game. I\u2019ve actually ceased communications with Chewbacca (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I\u2019d like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.","Luke Skywalker's loyal to you even in the face of my temptation, btw.","We\u2019re in a great spot. Belgium for you is a guarantee. Planning to take from holland or ruhr?","Why do you ask? I assumed you were going to disrupt support from Picardy with a convoyed army while I disrupted Burgundy? That way you can still use Nth to support the channel in case Chewbacca decides not to bother defending in the south","I\u2019m a little worried that a clever Chewbacca may let me into Pic, knowing that belgium is gone, and then move into IRI for invasion. I\u2019d almost rather cut Pic with the channel and risk losing the channel. And my favorite option is to support ruh to bel from nth, also risking the channel. The logic is that if I lose the channel, it won\u2019t be for very long, but if I lose a home supply center, that will be very annoying. Chewbacca seems pretty upset with me, so a kamikaze move to screw me over isn\u2019t out of the question.","Yeah, I'm getting that vibe from Chewbacca too. Let's go with moving me from Ruhr","Sounds good. Consistent with that theory, we\u2019d advise Yoda to support into Spain instead of Mar. It\u2019s a tough call though","I mean, not really. The way Yoda's positioned it seems like Spain is the only right call and that Marseilles will fall like a domino on a fault line next spring?\n\n...unless we could confirm that Chewbacca really doesn't intend to defend. Then Yoda could potentially swipe both in one swoop. But even if Chewbacca is saying such things to me (and they are) it's still a risk","Marseilles isn't guaranteed to fall next spring. Suppose Yoda supports into Spa. Chewbacca can block that supporting MAO from Gas. Suppose in the spring, Yoda changes course and goes for Mar. Chewbacca can then support Bur to Mar from Gas. Unless I'm missing something, it's a guessing game until you're in Bur.","God dammit. Just when I think I get this game, I\u2019m still not clear on how the \u2018coast\u2019 thing works with fleets","Do you think I could trust Luke Skywalker not to try to swipe Munich if I tried to take Bur this turn?","Yeah the territory can only be occupied by one unit regardless of coast. But a fleet must go to either the north or south coast. MAO can go to both. The coast matters if say you want to go from Spain to Mar. You can go there from the south coast, but not the north coast. And if you wanted to do this, you could coordinate a bounce with the Ber and Tyr armies so Luke Skywalker can't sneak in. You're planning to sneak into Mun unsupported?","sneak into Bur*","well, at least to try for it. i hadnt thought of bumping with Yoda because i assumed tyr would move into pie","Well your move only works if we let Bur into Mar, which means Yoda doesn't try for Mar, which means pie would hold.","oh i thought Yoda was trying for spa? or rather, wherever Yoda decides to go there's a chance it might work, and then they'd want someone in pie","We'll have to see which move Yoda wants to make. If Yoda goes for Spa, the choice is between a hold or an attack from Pie. I would say a hold makes most sense for Yoda if you've decided you're going for Bur. This is because the alternative may be a bounce with Bur and Pie armies in Mar that would foil your plan to get to Bur and wouldn't give Yoda anything.","Okay that makes sense then.","As long as Yoda doesn't want to try to convoy into Spain from Pie. Then Marseilles could be left open *and* tyrolia could potentially move into piedmont","Yeah that could be an idea. Well, let me know when you hear from Yoda. The good news is Chewbacca will definitely be down one this year and maybe down two. And our progress will continue next year. At some point we should talk about post-war things.","Does post-war things mean how we're going to deal with a seriously overpowered R2-D2\/Yoda?","Yeah. Though the move into Trieste by Yoda is interesting. I'm actually starting to worry about collaboration with Chewbacca. Would Yoda really be so greedy as to start a war on two fronts? Also, had you asked for a hold in Pie? (not that it would have changed the outcome)","I asked but Yoda told me that they couldn\u2019t guarantee they would or wouldn\u2019t, and I can understand wanting to keep that info need-to-know. But what makes you think Yoda and Chewbacca would collaborate?? Also, I\u2019m not so sure you should read that seizing of trieste as an act of war; Yoda *did* help R2-D2 take two supply centers this turn. R2-D2 might have given it willingly","*would or wouldn\u2019t hold Pie","R2-D2 expressed frustration to me about it. Also, R2-D2 can't build. All of its home supply centers are occupied. And Yoda only helped with one supply center, right? And yeah the Chewbacca theory may be a little paranoid, but why would Yoda make an enemy out of R2-D2 now while occupied with Chewbacca?","What are your thoughts on the Chewbacca campaign for this year?","Also, Yoda and R2-D2\u2019s stories about trieste don\u2019t line up. Yoda says it was an offering","Right that's what Yoda told me, too. So I'm not sure. Can I confront Yoda with what R2-D2 told you?\n\nI will be moving Kie-Ruh for sure.\nWe can half-heartedly attack Pic this spring if you want (I'll move Bel-Pic, you support), though I doubt we'll get anywhere with it\nMunich will support Kie-Ruh\nAnd Fall I'll do a three-sided assault on Bur. \nNone of this is very exciting though.  If Yoda can't make headway we'll probably be stuck in a holding pattern until you can shift some resources from the baltic.","Actually, I got Yoda on board to coordinate with us to leave one of Marseilles or Spain open for Chewbacca to fall into. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you could try for Mao, or if not I\u2019ll try for Bur. Let me know which you prefer and we\u2019ll talk plans","Yoda is now saying that he told a secret that R2-D2 didn't want him to tell, and that I shouldn't tell R2-D2 that I know that Trieste was arranged... Sigh.","I'll get back to you on MAO. Likely I won't, but maybe with very friendly Luke Skywalkern disbands. Trying for Bur makes sense.","Well you couldn't ask for friendlier disbands than that! What do you think about making a play for MAO? What if I could get Yoda onboard to support you in from WES?","Also, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on taking Luke Skywalker's northern holdings. \nOn the one hand, it's more power for you, but on the other weakening Luke Skywalker is pretty much the same as feeding R2-D2.","I'm nervous about MAO because I'd really like to keep holding the channel. Yeah I need to decide what to do with Luke Skywalker. It's really tempting to scoop up some supply centers, but that would be the end of Luke Skywalker.","In other news, Chewbacca (who continues to message in spite of my ghosting) just pointed out that Yoda has a number 1 ranking on playdiplomacy.com. The username checks out, but that's about as far as I can verify.","Right Chewbacca told me too. So it may be worth reconsidering our deal with the devil","I think Chewbacca may still have to go though. We can't be both allied with Chewbacca. Geographically it doesn't really make sense. However, me you and Luke Skywalker vs R2-D2 and Yoda might work well for us.","I think so too. But, realistically, as things stand now you, me, and Luke Skywalker V. Yoda\/R2-D2 just looks like me and Luke Skywalker getting sh*tkicked while you hang out in the back. So the question ought to be, can we afford to take down Chewbacca before I\/A get too powerful? Or is it worth it to put aside eating Chewbacca to nip this in the bud?","Luke Skywalker's actually in a really good position if I choose not to invade. I'd have to go over the tactics, but I'm pretty sure that line will hold in the south.","And then you can support Mun from Kiel.","When the time comes","I can bring my fleets around this year to support the attack on Chewbacca, and that would put us in good position to face Yoda. But we'd have to play it off as just going for Chewbacca until Chewbacca is gone.","but i thought you said you weren't gonna go for MAO?","I won't try from the channel. But I can bring the Nwy fleet around this year.","Why the fleet in berlin btw?","Well I figured that I'd need at least one more eventually, and that since my whole northern border is coastal a fleet might be better for defending that. But it'll be all armies after this I think.","That makes sense, though it does seem like it will be stuck there for a while unless you start coming for me and Luke Skywalker","Well at some point we'll all turn on each other, I assume. But I don't see that happening for a while. Not til Chewbacca Yoda and R2-D2 are dealt with","We can always play to a three way draw! So does this mean you would be committed to a Luke Skywalker-Darth Vader-Obi-Wan Kenobi alliance until the others are dealt with?","And to a point you made a few messages ago about me hanging in the back: Dealing with Yoda is going to take a lot from me. He's got the fleets that only I can deal with.","Yes, that's what this means. However, Yoda and Chewbacca are both pretty talkative with me these days which could be useful for us. So don't go spreading it around that my true allegiance right now is to you and Luke Skywalker.\n \nAnd speaking of fleet things: if you're not doing anything with Nth this turn anyway, could you help me out by supporting Hol-Bel? I think it makes sense for me to have a fleet with channel access in case you ever need support or a bounce there to keep Chewbacca out. Maybe some sunny day you'd even trust me to hold it for you, though I understand if not.","What sorts of things are you hearing from Yoda and Chewbacca? Also, are you talking to Luke Skywalker? I'm planning to support the channel with Nth","I just messaged Luke Skywalker. I told them about your suggestion of a three-way alliance, and that I was mainly focussed on attacking the west this year but if needed I could readjust to spare somebody to support in the east.\n\nI haven't heard back from Chewbacca yet, but I am sort of playing double-agent with Yoda to ensure that Chewbacca can continue countering Yoda's Spa\/Mar plays and it just looks like luck. This keeps Yoda in check until you and I make progress in the north and are better positioned to push Yoda back.\n\nI should have mentioned, but a third reason for the fleet build last turn was to keep Chewbacca's trust. I figured it made sense anyway for the other two reasons I mentioned, but I did want to make sure Chewbacca is willing to listen to me about Yoda.","Interesting that Yoda was willing to give up his guess to you. I had considered the idea of feeding Chewbacca info like this, but he wouldn't have believed anything I told him. And yeah it makes sense that something else was going on with the fleet situation.","What moves do you have planned westward?","Yoda was willing to give up their guess because I requested that Marseilles be left open so I could take Bur, (which I plan to attempt w\/ Munich this turn), and Yoda agreed.","Did Yoda explain why he didn't keep his end of the deal? Cause he moved to Mar","no I mean this turn","Ah ok. Cause we had talked about it last turn as well.","Last turn they didn't give me anything useful","Gotcha. Yoda had asked me for support into MAO, which would not be consistent with that though.","I did say no. Or rather haven't said yes. I'm curious about the timing though.","Today at 5:11 PM, Yoda said to me: \"If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)\". So, it could be that both are true and Yoda plans to do *neither*--rather than try to take Spa, Yoda's gonna try rearranging?","*5:11 central time","Ok at 6:08 PM EST, Yoda asked about MAO. So that's around the same time. I'm not going to support MAO and told Yoda as much.","Chewbacca would probably just cut in Bre anyways.","Was that the reasoning you gave for not supporting?","Just that it wouldn't be fruitful because Chewbacca would cut support. I also said that I was eyeing it for next year (which will be obvious from my upcoming move of the Nwy fleet)","Alright well sounds like we resolved that little mystery. Statecraft is exhausting.","Haha yeah. I don't know if I would do online diplomacy again (I've only done it in person). I've spent wayy too much time thinking about this game. But it's alson been fun","I'm prepping for an august in-person game I have scheduled with some friends","I have also been spending way too much time thinking about this! Yeah the days between adjudications are just too much.","I agree. In person is exhausting for other reasons though. You have to take a whole day out and it\u2019s much more stressful when you have 15 minute negotiations and everyone is in the same house.","oh I didn't even think of the logistics of in person negotiating! So if you and Luke Skywalker disappear for five minutes everybody knows somethings up?","Yeah, and also you see little cliques start to form. Like three countries will get together and then go quiet when someone else walks in the room. And you can just shout stuff to the room if you want. Also tactical and order errors are more common. And intentional order errors are a thing.","That sounds like a perfect storm of social- and tactical-anxiety inducing stimuli. I think the ideal thing from my perspective would be online play with three adjudications per day. So it's about the same level of commitment as a really active group chat.","Yeah people get pretty emotional. And I do it with a group of friends too. We decided we could only handle it once every 6 months or so.","three times a day would be too much for me I think. I feel like I wouldn't get any work done.","I could see that. But sacrifices have to be made.","Haha I'm NOT a multitasker, so I'd bet the sacrifice is bigger for me than it is for you. Also, I feel like it would be easier almost if I wasn't on the computer all day for work as it was. But having work and recreation competing for the same screen is really distracting for me.","you just described me. and my situation. But I take summers as pseudo-vacation so there's not as much consequence","Yeah that's not a bad way to do it. I'm a grad student in the same school\/department as admin actually. So I've also got a pseudo-vacation not taking classes or anything, but I'm still trying to be productive.","I'm in admin's department too! I should have realized: only grad students feel as guilty about spending time doing things they enjoy as you seem to \ud83d\ude1b \nBut back to business: any chance of letting me borrow Denmark? I figure that with Northern Luke Skywalker out of the picture your fleet's just sort of...parked there. But if you let me have it I will either build an army in Ber to help out Luke Skywalker or an army in Kiel to fight Chewbacca with. I totally understand if you don't want to, though.","Anyway, regardless of how you feel about the Denmark issue, I just hatched a plan to potentially help Chewbacca keep resisting Yoda, if you're game:\n\nTell Yoda you've had a change of heart and want to support them into MAO this turn, on the condition that they free it up for you by moving to Portugal next spring. \nIf Yoda agrees, let me know. I'll tell Chewbacca to put all power into defending Marseilles and Mao. \n\nThe hope is that since last turn *I* was the one who knew Yoda's move and this time--as far as Yoda knows--only *you'll* know it, Yoda won't smell a rat when Chewbacca is lucky in defending again","No way! I wonder if we've been walking past each other in Iribe and without any idea that we're both in the study. And let's bring up Denmark again when I have another build secured. Who knows how long it will take to get into Brest.","That's a reasonable plan for Yoda. Let me get a sense of where Yoda's head is at first. He may not even want MAO anymore.","Can you explain the fleet move btw?","Honestly because I thought you\u2019d say yes to giving me Denmark.\nI doubt we\u2019ve run into each other because I\u2019m in St Louis for the summer","Yeah, we should have talked about that  before probably. On its own, the move has a somewhat anti-me connotation. And yeah I definitely have not been to St Louis this summer haha","You're going for Bur this season?","Sorry to spook you! And not to beat a dead horse, but: you claim you want to secure another build, but with your denmark fleet basically stuck where it is, it\u2019s not like keeping it is going to help you with that goal. That supply center\u2019s doing nothing for you except maintaining the unit bound to it. *I* on the other hand, could help you get what you want by getting another build.\n\nIf you have plans to use the denmark fleet, I\u2019ll respect them, because right now our goals are the same. But I see no point in keeping the fleet just for its own sake.\n\nYep, going for Bur","Yeah I mean it's a bargaining chip. Luke Skywalker has to be in my good graces while I have it. And it's something I could offer you in exchange for something nice. It's not clear to me why you need it right now. Paris has your name on it. You'll win the eventual for Mar with no trouble.","Alright, that\u2019s a valid reason.\nI was feeling more urgent about it because I think it\u2019s paramount that Luke Skywalker get some aid against R2-D2.","Yeah that's fair. I think Luke Skywalker is clever enough to re-instate the stalemate, though. Maybe I'll drop him a line to see what he's thinking.","BTW Yoda plans to literally randomize his move choice.","Thanks for letting me know!","Nice job on Bur. Let's see if we can get you paris next year!","What's your plan for taking MAO? If you want to move Eng-IRI I will support Nth into the Channel?","Yeah i was thinking the same actually. Only risk is a bump in IRI i think results in dislodge of the current channel unit. I\u2019m willing to risk it though. Chewbacca at this point is likely trying to choose who to annoy the most as he goes down. I have a feeling it will be me, even though i\u2019m not the one taking his territories so far. I\u2019ll probably go another year without a build unfortunately","Patience, my tea-sipping friend \ud83d\ude1b \nBut if you dislodge trying to get IRI that means you at least got Nao, and putting the unit in Pic would help you take Brest anyway","Oh i\u2019m planning nwg to nth so that i\u2019m still in nth. Do you think the brest fleet may move to Pic?","ya know, if you'd just let me have Denmark back you could keep Nth *and* get at least one of Nao\/Iri\/Brest this year.\nI can keep talking to Chewbacca to see where their head's at, but I think a move to Pic is probably not in the cards. If you were to predict it Chewbacca'd lose Brest!","Are you still on good terms with Chewbacca? Was the move into Bur expected?","It was, actually. Chewbacca has seen the end coming for a while, but since I was willing to work with them against Yoda while you two ghosted, they're more amenable to my invasion that yours or Yoda's.","Makes sense. Well, let me think about whether Denmark is a possibility (though I\u2019m still very hesitant) and get back to you. And I let me know what Chewbacca is up to with Brest.","Alternatively, why not just leave Nth empty for a turn? \nI'm working on figuring out Chewbacca as we speak...","Cool. And I suppose I could, though it does leave me a little vulnerable. Maybe we could talk a bit about what our collaboration looks like over the next couple of years","Well, I can say definitively at this point that Chewbacca prefers to mess with Yoda over you. Basically they don't want to see Yoda totally dominate this game. I encouraged this by saying that Yoda's going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that. \n\nWrt the next couple years, my idea is this: it's crucial that you take Mao, and that I take Paris. From here, you and I can work on beating Yoda out of the Iberian, such that you end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and I end up with Brest and Paris (though you can have Brest at first). From here we're well positioned to start hitting Yoda on their home turf, esp. if Luke Skywalker can keep hammering away at R2-D2","...any thoughts on this?","That all makes sense. Thought I'm a bit surprised that you'd rather have Brest than Mar. What's the reasoning for that preference? And how long would you let me hold onto Brest?","I figured this split would give you land and sea options for attacking Yoda and not for attacking me. But I was just spitballing, and it may make more sense to divide it your way...And you could hold Brest until we were the only two in all of Chewbacca and Spain, I suppose","have you made a decision yet about what to do about Nth?","I prefer to do the same moves as last time. So Nth would be a hold. I don't think MAO is going to IRI or NAO. But you would have the inside scoop.","What would you do with Bel if it was freed up?","Wait when you say Nth is a hold, do you mean you *don't* want to try for IRI like we talked about, and you're just holding the channel?","That\u2019s what i\u2019m thinking now, yes","*just holding the channel and convoying to Brest?\n\nAnd if by \"it\" in \"what would you do with Bel if it was freed up?\", you mean Nth, then probably move it to Pic in case Chewbacca tries to bounce me out of Paris. But it might make more sense for you to just convoy to Pic, in which case Bel could support you into Pic","oh nevermind you mean \"what would you do with Bel if Bel wasn't supporting Nth\"? Well, my answer still applies","...Would you like me to support your army into Pic?","That army isn\u2019t leaving the island until Chewbacca\u2019s fate is sealed. Otherwise I open up my home centers to Chewbacca.","but you did convoy to brest last time? Was that just because you were sure the army would bounce? \n\nSo then basically everyone's holding still except you're poking Nao?","Yeah that\u2019s my plan. The convoy was because if it worked, I could just build on the island and be fine. But i\u2019m taking on a risk if i can\u2019t guarantee the build.","ohh gotcha. I'm moving Bur-Par, Ruh-Bur. Everyone else is just staying put","I really am curious about your relationship with Chewbacca btw. Yoda mentioned that you asked him recently whether collaboration with Chewbacca was ok. But what could that mean unless it was against me?","\ud83d\ude44 Yoda said that you were plotting against me, too! They're just trying to make us suspicious of each other!","So you\u2019re saying Yoda lied to me? I\u2019m gonna make you click that thumbs down if you\u2019re trying to fool me here.","Well, no. It's true that I asked Yoda about collaborating with Chewbacca, but only because Chewbacca wanted us all to be able to talk about its last will and testament together. I didn't bother asking you because you had been pretty clear on ghosting Chewbacca, but I wasn't sure whether Yoda was or not til I asked","But it's very possible that Yoda took this fact and warped it to make you suspicious of me","So, while we're at it, is there anything you might have said to Yoda to indicate you were planning to turn on me?","Well i\u2019m glad i asked the follow up question. Did Yoda agree to being part of this discussion? And how did the discussion turn out. Is Chewbacca going to take out his anger on me with a final stab? Are you going to help him? And yeah i\u2019ve absolutely been talking up anti-Darth Vader things to Yoda. I want him to be confident in where i stand so he doesn\u2019t expect a stab.","Oh Yoda said \"I don't trust Chewbacca\" and that was the end of it. So no, there didn't end up being a discussion except me telling Chewbacca that you're gunning for Brest (which was obvious anyway), and that Yoda's shooting for Mao this turn (which may or may not be true--but by this time you and I were strategizing and I wanted to keep Chewbacca out of our way). \nIf Chewbacca *is* planning to stab you, they're intentionally throwing me off the scent. Which would be surprising but not unheard of. So no, I'm not planning to help in a stab I know nothing about.","Well, to be clear, another consequence of my and Chewbacca's conversation was that Chewbacca is just letting me walk into Paris this turn (unless they're gonna stab me but I doubt it)","Yeah i believe that. So i guess it\u2019s just giving Yoda a hard time then, or maybe some unexpected movement north. Has Yoda talked to you about attacking me?","Post-Chewbacca?","Well yeah. In the same convo where they said you were plotting to stab me they gave some reasons why it's better for me to side with them than with you. So no specifics but Yoda clearly wants us against each other. But I don't think either of us stand a chance if we fall for that.","*no specific attacks were suggested, I mean","Gotcha. Well i think we have to acknowledge that our alliance would be sort of geographically awkward. I think that makes the alliance stronger actually, but we should be honest with each other about an exit that gives each of us a fair shot in the endgame.","okay...well, as the person who has ever seen an endgame before, what do *you* suggest?","I think we agree to coordinated actions until Yoda is dealt with. I think you in brest is actually more fair, although less ideal for me. I think we need to pick a victor of the Luke Skywalkern-R2-D2n war. R2-D2 is an easier pick because i can take Luke Skywalkern dots and R2-D2 can help with Yoda.","Alright. But it will be harder to flip R2-D2 against Yoda, I think.","Nah, i\u2019ve been working on it a bit, and it\u2019s only natural once his current conflict is mitigated somewhat","I think between us we should find a split of dots we feel comfortable with. Not that it can\u2019t change in future negotiations. But i think it\u2019s easier to stay friends when the end seems fair from the get-go","We don\u2019t have to do this tonight, but soon.","Okay, soon. Glad we had this talk \ud83d\ude03","Fwiw i\u2019m a relative first-timer too. I\u2019ve played two or three times in person, and the first time we didn\u2019t finish. I think everyone else plays a lot more. Would be nice to make this an underdog story.","Regardless of which way it falls in the end.","I think so, too. And Yoda is like the over-est of dogs.","You lost me haha. The over-est of dogs?","like, the opposite of underdog would be overdog. And Yoda is the most over-est overdog there is.","*the overwolf, perhaps","Haha gotcha. Do we think he\u2019s actually the number 1 guy like Chewbacca said? He denied it to me. But the username lines up.","I think it's more probable than not. Although, I also think it's really unfair to have that information leaked when other players get the benefit of a clean slate. That said, just looking at the way Yoda moves and talks it's clear that they know what they're doing","Yeah he\u2019s definitely a good player. All the better when we take him down.","ugh I really wish everyone'd stop using *he* all the time. Chewbacca and Yoda know each other from outside this game, but it irks me that \"he\" seems to be the default. Out of curiosity, do you\/others use \"she\" when referring to me?","I had been using \u201cthey\u201d, but then i stopped once i saw other people using gendered pronouns. My rationalization was that the other players must have been confident in their correctness to start using them, but obviously that\u2019s not true. We use \u201cshe\u201d for you. Chewbacca said it to me first i think. Happy to commit to being gender neutral in future negotiations (with all players)","I didn\u2019t mean to be directive\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter that much to me, but it makes me feel better if I know people aren\u2019t just doing it mindlessly, and are actually matching it to players they know. I never specified to Chewbacca that I use \u201cshe\u201d but my username is feminine so it was a fair assumption.","Yeah that\u2019s totally fair. I will admit I had floated the idea of trying to play feminine and flirt with one of the probably straight male players to gain favor. The username\u2019s a giveaway though. And that might be taking things too far haha.","That can\u2019t possibly actually work, can it? The flirting, I mean. This is a serious game for serious-minded individuals \ud83d\ude1b","...\u201d, she writes, before adding a playful emoji at the end.","All\u2019s fair in love, war, and diplomacy \ud83d\ude09","Ouch! Still open to collaboration, but we\u2019ve got some trust building to do","I wasn't sensing any trust from you, either: you were unwilling to return Denmark or to leave Nth empty, and you're right about our alliance being geographically awkward. \n\nI want to be a good ally with you, but the difference between you and me is that you get a cozy corner of the map and I'm right in the middle. I need to be able to grow my army to defend all my various borders. So I'm asking for Denmark a little less politely.","Well now you've seen me make exactly the moves that I said I would, so hopefully you have some trust in me. I see what you mean about the cozy corner, but coziness has its disadvantages as well. Once somebody gets on the island, it's a really bad time. And I need fleets or convoys of armies to get anywhere off the island. Makes expansion difficult.","As far as denmark, the aggression there is fair. But you understand why I'm hesitant to drop down to 4 dots at this point in the game. Fortunately, there's an opportunity to do business here now that you're adjacent to Brest.","I'm definitely a bit upset about the support into the channel you gave and all of the lying. You didn't need to lie about your moves to amp up the aggression on denmark: I never asked for a full list of moves.","That's true, I was overcompensating because it really seemed like your trust in me was low.","Well, it's a vicious cycle. Mistrust breeds mistrust. So how can I trust now that you're not just going to continue working with Chewbacca on an invasion?","Because Chewbacca is literally about to not exist, for one. And for another, because Yoda is planning something that will be bad for both of us.","Planning something specific that you know about?","Yes. But I was told specifically not to tell you so I need you to not mention it to any other players. I know that's a hard sell coming from me, but I need you to promise.","Alright. It\u2019s a promise. Who\u2019s the info from?","Doubly confirmed by Chewbacca and Yoda. They've reached an agreement to give Yoda the channel. When I confronted Yoda about it, Yoda said they wouldn't do it if I didn't want them to, but also admitted that they wouldn't have told me about it if I hadn't asked.","But Chewbacca also told me they would reneg on Yoda if I asked. So, on the one hand, I could tell Yoda to call it off and things could proceed some unknown way. On the other, I could get Chewbacca to reneg, and the three of us could turn this to our advantage. What do you think?","It\u2019s certainly possible this is true. Though Yoda had told me he was actively deceiving Chewbacca into getting the brest unit to do something unusual","So if Yoda is truly going for the channel, he went so far as to cover his tracks by warning me he may have suggested something like this to Chewbacca","To what extent has Yoda communicated plans of an alliance with you?","I mean that doesn't seem out of the question for Yoda. Yoda has told me point blank that if it's a choice between you or me, they'd choose me. I'm sure they've said the same to you.","Did he give any reasoning for that choice?","Some bull about how I'm an honest communicator. That raised a red flag for me because Yoda's too smart to need honesty from me. You're the better strategic choice. \n\nSo, it's entirely possible that Yoda fed me this plot through Chewbacca as some kind of ploy. And even that the two of you are already working closely together to ruin me, although I do hope that's not the case.","I agree with all that. I\u2019m just trying to tease out who he\u2019s lying to, as that may provide some advantage. Honestly he\u2019s been more pro-Obi-Wan Kenobi than anti-Darth Vader in his communications with me. I think he maybe just doesn\u2019t want me to go tattle to you though.","So what moves would you want to see from me this fall?","I'll tell Yoda the deal is off, then you move Den-Nth, Nth-Eng (supported by Bel), Eng-Bre (supported by Paris). Mao will take Portugal and you'll take Mao? I know you'll have to trust my support in two places, but it's worth it to me to get two builds this turn  without a fuss and keep Yoda localized to the south.","Did Yoda tell you MAO would take Portugal?","No. I haven't given them my opinion on the channel deal yet. But that would be what I'd suggest they do instead","Alright. Would you be able to confirm that this is where MAO would go before I agree to a deal?","I just sent Yoda a message about it, so I'll see what they say.","What has Yoda been saying to you lately, by the way?","He suggested some defensive tactics to me.","Defensives against me? in Denmark? Or Chewbacca in Iri? Or both?","Both. He\u2019s under the impression that we are not friendly after those last moves. I don\u2019t plan to take his suggestion though","I'm wondering if these defenses involve you not supporting Eng, which would kind of half-confirm the plot.","They do involve me not supporting Eng.","Yoda said they are busy this weekend (hard for me to imagine people having a life, but it must be so) and won't get back to me til monday.","Gotcha. I\u2019m playin dnd this weekend, but i\u2019m not sure that quite counts as having a life). I\u2019ll probably be mostly offline through sunday evening just cause i really need a break from this game","Umm the plan doesn't work btw. Gas is just going to cut the Par support that you promised me (this is the only useful thing it can do). So, no deal, unfortunately. I'll see if I can get last minute support in from Yoda and let you know.","I really don't think an attack from Gascony would be an issue, but I understand that your trust in Chewbacca is much lower than mine. We could still work together somehow, though?","In a tactical sense, anything else from Gascony would be a misfire. So not cutting the Paris support is just giving up Brest. I really don't think Chewbacca is just going to hand Brest to me. I'm still waiting to see if I can get Yoda support, in which case we're back in business. The alternative would be a more defensive move on my part (i really don't want to go down to 4 dots at this phase in the game).","Ok. Hope you'll see this before noon. Yoda has agreed to support into Bre. I also require Par support for this to go through. Do you agree to provide Par supports channel to Bre and Bel supports Nth to Channel? I will vacate Denmark if so","Ok, well if I don't hear from you in the next couple of minutes, I won't assume the support and will play defensive.","Sorry I'm trying to get verification from Yoda but they're not responding. That's a good default plan","I don't think you're going to get verification from Yoda. Yoda is online and talking to me though.","Ok do I have your supports?","Yes","Deal on!","Yep, Denmark going to Nth.","got Yoda confirmation...hope this goes through","drum roll......","Yay!","wow an 11th-hour three-power deal (with a decieved Chewbacca as a fourth) that actually went through as planned!","Yeah. And although we had our hiccups, this was really about as good as we could have hoped the takedown to be from the beginning.","do you think there's a chance Yoda would give you Mao willingly this turn?","There's a chance. I'm surprised by the fleet build btw.","My plan is to eventually have only fleets along my northwest coast (they're more versatile in that context) and move the armies inland. \n\nSee what you can negotiate with Yoda, but no matter what they say, I'd be prepared to use your full strength to get Nao into Mao, if that's what you want to do. (And in case it's not obvious, it's what *I* think you should do)","To that end, I can support Eng  and Bre holding.","I appreciate the supports. Any idea what trouble Chewbacca will be trying to cause?","I imagine you'll get a request about Bre.","Chewbacca and Yoda are probably not working together after last year's stab. But Chewbacca has asked me if there's anything I want Pic to help with. So depending on your plans I *may* be able to push some help your way. I feel like Yoda's 10 units kind of speak for themselves, so even though you and F have had your differences there's a good chance F will want to help you\/us as the underdogs","Yeah I mean this turn I don't know what Pic does to help me. Anti-Yoda moves are MAO as you've described. What are your thoughts on supporting Bre to Gas from Par? This would require a lot of trust from you, but would make supporting into Spa possible in the fall.","Does that mean you'd convoy into Bre? Because I can ask Chewbacca to support that!","But it would also mean you don't take a shot at Mao this turn, which is something I'd want to see.","In this plan, I leave Bre open. I suppose that's too great a risk with Chewbacca there?","Well, especially if I'm asking for Chewbacca's help, yeah. But even without revealing the plan, I still think it's a risk.","Could you ask Chewbacca for support into the channel maybe?","Or say that you'll support Chewbacca in?","hmmm that could work! Then we only have to trust that Yoda won't try and take Brest. Which isn't too far fetched since they *just* helped you take it","Hmm, no there's an issue with the retreat if I dislodge MAO.","Here's an idea. Tell Chewbacca you're supporting Pic to Bre. Then just bounce Par in Bre.","Elegant. I like it.","Yoda goes to IRI, but I can defend with the wales army","Any thoughts on Luke Skywalker btw? I imagine Swe is tempting","It *is* tempting, but I'm not trying to fight Yoda and Luke Skywalker at the same time. And Luke Skywalker's been pretty honest with me. So I'll leave it for now.","That's fair. Any intel on Yoda btw? Where do your relations stand?","Yoda doesn't tell me anything unless they have something to gain from me. I asked if they were going to try and take the channel again and they denied it, but that could be fake news?","Take it with Chewbacca support? Otherwise it wouldn't make sense","Well, I suppose I'm comfortable that Yoda sees me as a friend on the board.","You're right that *if* Yoda were to try that again, it would take a lot of negotiating to get Chewbacca's favor. So probably you're right to not be concerned.","Alright. I\u2019ll be somewhat not available this evening, so can you confirm moves to make sure we\u2019re on the same page?","Paris supports Bre-Gas, Bel supports Eng holding, Ber-Mun, Mun-Bur","WAIT NO (sorry I was making pie and lost track of this game): I'm waiting on confirmation from Chewbacca about Pic-Bre, which I will bounce with Par-Bre","making piedmont?","And no worries","haha I wish","peach piedmont","Sounds delicious","Chewbacca confirmed the move to Bre so the plan is a-go","Ouch again! Care to have a chat?","well you weren't exactly truthful either!","I think we may need to face the fact that we're just not a good match","I suppose you\u2019re not interested in what I have to say then?","No I am. Alls i\u2019m saying is that we should both be taking grains of salt with each others\u2019 words","Yeah that\u2019s fair. With what i\u2019m about to disclose, regardless of whether you believe it or use the knowledge against me, I would ask that it be confidential from anyone else on the board (including the fact that I\u2019m asking for this confidentiality). I know you\u2019ve sent plenty of lies my way, but if you agree i\u2019d really like it to be the truth this time.","I promise not to mention it to anyone else; let\u2019s hear it","Ok just to be really specific about it: Can we agree on the story that we ceased communications. You said we\u2019re not a good match and I said \u201csuit yourself\u201d and that was it? And can we also promise to not make the communication obvious without saying it exactly (e.g. \u201csomeone told me xyz\u201d when only I could have known). And to be clear i\u2019m agreeing to the confidentiality as well.","Okay, sure. But there\u2019s something I want to know (and I\u2019ll keep my agreement now no matter what the answer):\nDid you in any way indicate to Yoda that you knew\/suspected the channel plot last year?","No, he revealed the channel plot to me without me asking","This was after you told me about it","Well that makes no sense, because after I revealed it to you, Yoda reiterated to me that they really did not want you to know about it.","I think Yoda wanted to be the one to tell me so he would keep my trust. I\u2019d have to look to see whether this was revealed before or after Brest went through, but I know at least that before Brest I was confident he wasn\u2019t going for the channel.","Well anyway, what did you want to tell me? It stays between us, guaranteed, but I would reserve the right to move according to this information if I think it necessary","Yeah that's totally fine. So last night I made a deal with the devil. One that he couldn't refuse. It's a lie that I will uphold it, but I think it's a convincing one.","Okay, go on","I told Yoda I would do everything in my power to get him the game. In exchange I asked to 1) be kept alive until the end and 2) get tips from him on how to play the game before my upcoming in-person game. I told him that MY win is about getting the best experience from this game so that I'm prepared for the in-person game (this is kind of true).","Since then he's told me some pretty interesting things. I'll send you some quotes.","\"that thing Chewbacca said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.\"","\"I\u2019ll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Darth Vader wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Darth Vader to support Chewbacca to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!\"","\"To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else\u2019s moves on that turn! Luke Skywalker is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.\"","\"I\u2019m not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I\u2019m their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.\"","That's what I got.","And if Yoda continues to talk this way, I might have more to share, and would be happy to share it.","Damn that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for sharing!\nDid he say why he was so keen to have your army on the mainland?","It's so it's not on the homeland.","I\u2019m surprised you were willing to do that. Why?","Yoda promised me Paris. You were going to go to Nth from Bel, and then Chewbacca was going to retreat to Bel.","Oh so Yoda screwed you! \nHe\u2019ll do the same to me when the time comes. \n...would you be willing to give me some warning of when that is, if you\u2019re involved in it? Ya know, just for the fun of sticking it to a master manipulator?","I'd obviously prefer something a bit more collaborative than that. Yoda will be at 12 SUPPLY CENTERS this fall. I'm not giving up on a mutually beneficial relationship here. Especially given that I may have some inside scoop from Yoda for a while.","13 if I help him into Brest.","Well look, Obi-Wan Kenobi, given that Yoda or you could be talking crap at any moment, I see taking your supply centers as a more certain path to my survival than having your\/his information. If you are actively going to help him take supply centers, then at best you\u2019re surviving at the expense of making an enemy of everyone, because you\u2019d be Yoda\u2019s dog, not his ally. It\u2019s your choice, though.","I've not lied to you once this game. You can check the record with admin after if you're curious. Have I deceived you? Certainly. But I've not made explicit agreement to moves that I didn't follow through with. That includes Denmark (we had discussed strategy, and I said I'd confirm moves in the morning, and then I just never did, which I know was shitty). So I just want to be clear on that.","Don\u2019t quibble semantics with me! Deception\u2019s deception and we\u2019re *both* guilty of it. If anything, it makes me trust you less if you think mere technicality gives you the moral high ground here","I'm not asking for moral high ground. I'm giving you my knowledge that my deception to you has historically taken the form of truth. If we work on being more explicit with our agreements, I think we can build trust there.","And regardless of whether I'm Yoda's dog, I wouldn't be so sure of getting my supply centers. I can defend everything this year, and I may be able to hold you off next year as well. At that point, Yoda's fleets may be in position to push you off the island.","What I can't defend is Yoda taking Liverpool.","You can if you retreat to Edi?","At least for this year","No I can retreat to Skag if I want. I can bounce Edi from NWG and bounce london from the channel.","So you're not saying you *cant* defend liverpool, just that you'd prefer not to. *Now* who's using imprecise language \ud83d\ude1b","No I can't. Yoda is in MAO. My army is not on the island. He can get there in one move and I can't.","NAO*","you *can* if you retreat to Edi!","or york even","Oh wow you're right. That was dumb. Yes I can.","York doesn't work because the move is illegal. Can't go around the coast like that.","Oh and actually I was right. Edi applies in the same way","Cly is in the way. Fleets have to move along the coast.","wait, I'm confused. What? The unit displaced from Nth. You haven't given retreat orders yet. Go to Edi?","Ohhhhhhh of course","A fleet in Edi can't go to Lvp. An army could, but a fleet can't","Yeah, you got it.","That confused me for a second too.","So if you're willing to collaborate, I've got some ideas, and would want to hear yours as well. I genuinely think working with me against Yoda will be a better long-term strategy for you than working against Yoda or alone. Yoda is just too strong already. And, as I've said before, I'd like to see an underdog story.","right now my retreat is to Skag, which will not raise any alarms on Yoda's end. Is this alright with you or would you like to see something different?","working with Yoda or alone*** for two messages ago","updated to Nwy. More friendly to you.","Well, that means a lot. \n...I take back what I said about wanting all your dots. I'm waiting for Yoda to get back to me about strategy for this turn, and when he does I'll get back to you with what counter plan I can offer. I think this is going to be a turning point where I either commit fully against you or commit fully with you, and it hinges on what Yoda is planning. Just know that I'm not going to offer a plan to you unless it's a real one. No contract-law trickery, no outright deceit. And if you don't hear from me, well, it's because we've *both* chosen the devil and our own glorious undoing at his hands","Haha, this is fair. Best of luck in negotiations. Regardless of what you choose, I commit to offering you any counter-Yoda intel I can gather.","Would you be willing to also hear a plan offer from me?","I am. And it stays between us, of course.","So, broadly speaking, the alliance would involve R2-D2. And that means moving against Luke Skywalker. We have a huge advantage going into Luke Skywalker, which takes pressure off of R2-D2 and allows R2-D2 to put pressure on Yoda.","Alright--haha I was just in a sandbox ordering you to move to sweden anyway \ud83d\ude03","Hmm, you might lose Munich this year though.","This has been noted.","No specific intel there, just saying tactically it's a possibility. I don't know if Yoda would go for that. I mean we had discussed someone going to munich before his stab, but I don't know if that can be trusted","Well before you and I started chatting Yoda denied that he had any plans for munich this season, but his word isn't exactly his bond","Yeah, not sure what he'll do there. It may be in his interest to remain neutral. Certainly if he catches any wind of what's going on, Munich is vulnerable. Maybe something to consider in setting up next year","We get to choose what happens in Brest, which is great. And then the tricky bit is figuring out how to kick Yoda off the island","mhm. I was sort of depending on getting a build this turn, such that I'd have someone around to defend Mun. So I would be sacrificing that by working with you. I can convoy Holland to York?","Let's get you in Brest then.","You'd still have to dissolve somebody, then","Go down to 4, sure. But if I go to sweden I stay at 4.","I would like your help getting liverpool back if you convoy there, as opposed to having you take it. However, your army will be a little precarious on the island and will need a way off.","convoy to yor*","the threat of MAO to IRI will be a pain, but I think we can manage.","Right--I wouldn't expect to get to take it (liverpool) if you're handing me Brest. \nAnd if Yoda and I \"agree\" to a plan where he does some supporting from Mao, and he says nothing to you to contradict that plan, would you take that as enough proof that IRI is safe?","Yeah, that makes sense. I'll let you know anything I hear from him. He's been quiet this morning. Ok I need to sign off for like a while to get work done. My fall moves under this plan will be Nwy to Swe, NWG to either Edi or Cly, Pic and Eng support Par to Bre,","I think the plan I have in the works might be better than yours, so I'll get back to you later!","Haha alright. Better for you or better for both of us?","Worse for Yoda, equally good for me, potentially better for you.","Alright, I'll be happy to hear it.","New confidential Yoda quote: \"I suggest that you take Sweden, and I\u2019m working on getting Belgium this turn too. It\u2019ll be tricky to keep Darth Vader from defending it, but I\u2019m going to try.\"","Did he have anything to say about you retreating to norway instead of skag?","He was surprised, but not upset. I said my justification was that it was going to Sweden anyways and that I wanted to warm things up with Darth Vader. Did you hear anything?","Yoda only just responded to me, so nothing yet.","Still nothing from Yoda, but if we *were* to have a plan, I think it should be this:\n\nEng s Bre-Mao, Bre-Mao, Pic-Bre, Par-Gas, Bur s Par-Gas, Nwy-Swe, Nwg-Cly, Nth c Hol-Edi","Your promptness in reporting Yoda's words to me plays to your advantage: if the next message from Yoda to me suggests I do something that leaves Belgium vulnerable, I'll pretty much be so revolted that I'll have no choice but to stab him","Will continue to send things your way, though I\u2019m not sure how much more i\u2019ll hear. How come you prefer Edi to Bre? Your proposition seems to leave me more vulnerable.","Also, thoughts on messaging to Chewbacca? I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll ask Yoda what he wants me to say, and I\u2019ll say that. I\u2019ll also tell you what I say","Ugh I *knew* you'd say that. (The vulnerability thing). Note the plan also leaves Paris wide open. We need to *trust* each other. But it makes more sense for Paris to move to Gascony to put some pressure on or--dare I dream it--take marseilles and the southern holdings. Since Chewbacca might go poof next near it is better for *me* to be there.","And in order to help your ouster from liverpool I needed somebody on the island anyway. You're pretty much equally vulnerable whether they're in york or edi","As for Chewbacca messaging, I'm not really sure. I only just messaged them for the first time this season (they asked me first what I'd like them to do), telling them basically what I've told you (that I stand at the crossroads of either playing Yoda's game or fighting back with your help). I'm waiting to hear which they think I should do. If you want to urge them to help our plot, that's your prerogative.","Chewbacca was expressing anti-Yoda sentiments to me. Yoda told me to respond anti-Yoda, so that\u2019s what i\u2019ll do. My thought about Edi is that if you were to go to york and the rest of the plan stays the same, we get another unit to fight with. I could build an army in Edi, for example. Do you feel like you need Edi as collateral? I\u2019m with you all the way on this plan, so i\u2019m willing to be flexible, but I do like to understand what you\u2019re thinking.","Same as I was thinking before: I need a build so someone's around to defend Munich. you were willing to part with Brest and let me into york, so I don't see why parting with Edi (temporarily!!) is really all that different","Alright. Can we agree on when I get it back? And how confident are you in holding Mun this year?","This just in from Yoda: \"Chewbacca is ordering Brest to Channel. Darth Vader is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....!\"","And the follow-up: \"So here is the move: Norway - Swe, Pic S Channel - Belgium, Mar - Bur to cut support, Gas to Bre to block the Paris move. \"","Yoda's playing us both, you can believe that. He fed me the moves you specified, then turned around and fed them to you. He only gains by playing off both of us. Well, fuck 'em.","sorry for swearing.","No swearing is fine if it's against Yoda. Have you made your decision then?","And I'm a little confused about what you mean by sending us both the same moves.","I mean he said \"here's what I suggest: [the moves you sent me just now]\" and I said \"okay sure!\" because deception is important in this game, i'm told. Then he told you the moves, then you told them to me! \nBut because he suggested leaving Bel undefended and you *warned* me about it, I had made up my mind in that moment.","Gotcha. So we're both sworn to take down Yoda? I certainly am.","I also have a bad feeling you'll be losing Mun this turn. Have you talked to Luke Skywalker about it?","I'm going tell Yoda I agree to the proposition. Sound good?","He's as slimy as spaghetti al'olio and he needs to be knocked down a peg. Plan on!\n\nThere's nothing whatsoever I can offer Luke Skywalker right now. So no, I didn't bother talking to them about it. Either it happens or it doesn't, far as I'm concerned","And yes please tell Yoda you agree to those moves. I love a good surprise.","*okay to be clear plan is not on til I hear back from Chewbacca. But *I'm* on board.","Plan is not on, but working together against Yoda definitely on?","On like beans on an Obi-Wan Kenobi breakfast plate","Ok, I'm going to take your word for it that Obi-Wan Kenobi breakfast has beans","What do you think about Par support Bre to Gas?","If I get into Bre, this will leave Gas vacant. The planned Bur support of Par won't go through based on Yoda's moves","From Yoda: \"Darth Vader is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I\u2019d like to tell her that you\u2019re mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.\"","All I said was \"Do you know anything about what Obi-Wan Kenobi's planning?\" so he has no idea we talk","I just wanted to see if he'd be honest with me. Of course he's covering his ass by asking you first.","Yeah I believe it. I'm going to respond and say that we shored up discussions this morning (which is what we originally planned the story to be)","wait I thought 'shored up' meant 'repaired or fortified'? do you mean like 'shuttered discussions'?","Oh you're probably right. I should work on my idioms","I mean that you basically said \"I don't think we can be good allies\", and I was like \"But, but.... \" and you didn't get back to me","lol so I'll make sure not to use the same idiom as you if Yoda asks *me* if you and I talk!","yep that's the story","My reply: \"No, but I'd bet she'd assume it. We didn't have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn't going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven't heard anything. So I'd imagine she'd think I'm not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Up to you how to spin it though.\"","Oh, and I'm sure he'll spin me something pretty, all right.","Yeah, we'll see. And the Bre to Gas move I brought up? (repeating so it doesn't get buried)","If we can trust Yoda's reported moves, it's the right call. I'd say it's our best option.\n\n...and something that *did* get buried: I'm willing to move out of Edi during the upcoming fall. I'll dissolve my Nth fleet since its only real purpose was stabbing you anyway","Perfect. And who gets Lvp next fall?","And do you think Chewbacca will do the move? I'd rather you suggest it so I keep a low profile.","I still haven't heard from Chewbacca. And we already agreed that you take liverpool.","Ok great. I didn't remember if we'd explicitly brought it up. I think all of this will work out well if we get Chewbacca on board. I'm attacking MAO from Channel in preparation for a supported move to Bre (Yoda didn't mention the MAO moves, and I'd rather not ask at this point).","OMG I thought adjudication was midnight tonight. We've got so much time. I'll be offline for a while (or I should be, cause I need to stop blowing off work). I've ordered:\nF ENG - MAO\nF NWG - Cly\nF Nwy - Swe\nA Pic - Bre\n\nBut we'll obviously discuss as adjudication approaches\/we learn more.","New Yoda message: \"Hmmm, Darth Vader is backing off the bait. I think we will have to change our plan.\"","Well that's not true! But i *did* just disagree to something he wanted me to do in Munich...","Hang on this is good: we're gonna see what his real priorities are! He wanted me to cut support from Boh, and I refused.","\"Not sure yet, but she is not going to leave Belgium unguarded so that won\u2019t work.\"","Okay so he's trying to get you to change your moves regarding Pic and the channel...","Yeah. Will be interested to see what he says.","Ok signing off for a few hours now.","Okay so I'm trying a little experiment: I told Yoda that the last message you sent me hinted that if *I* didn't work with you, maybe Yoda would. I said that knowing this, I *know* there's more than what he claims going on with the two of you. There's a chance he'll tell *me* some \"expected\" moves of yours, and between what he tells me and what he tells you, we'll know exactly what he's planning. Or at least get a better sense of it.","Nice. Ok Yoda\u2019s response is consistent with what you said.","[sigh] please tell me you didn\u2019t tell him everything.","Here's what I said, verbatim (it's long...hope it doesn't break the bot):\n\nBut Obi-Wan Kenobi's desperate. Better to talk with someone than just go in blind. And I doubt they'd turn to Luke Skywalker or Chewbacca because neither is really close enough\/powerful enough to give real help. And there's precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: Chewbacca.\n\n...and here's the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you've been sneaky and you've always pitted me and Obi-Wan Kenobi against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial Obi-Wan Kenobi seeking your advice, it would be so easy to just feed Obi-Wan Kenobi enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. \n\nI know this from experience: back when you were doing 50\/50 shots in the south of Chewbacca, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to Chewbacca. This was merely a time-buying measure, since Chewbacca was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now. \n\nI'm offering this confession in hopes that you'll do the same. So just come clean and let's approach this thing as equals?","I may have gone a little overboard but all my reasoning and everything I say is factual. So he has no reason to suspect you as long as you insist we don't talk","Alright that adds up. Something about getting a message from Yoda about it right after you sending me that made me a little nervous. I\u2019ve explained that we don\u2019t talk","I've confronted him before about deliberately pitting us against each other, so he knows I've always been suspicious of your relationship","Gotcha. Ok he said that you were pressing hard for moves, and that he would respond that we\u2019re friendly but haven\u2019t discussed particular moves","yeah that's been his line so far. The lying bastard.","In fairness he doesn\u2019t know my actual moves haha. Still nothing from Chewbacca? Nothing from my end","Yeah radio silence. Chewbacca might have a life\/better work ethic than any of us. Or maybe just doesn't care about this game anymore.","Haha yeah. Well if we hear nothing that may be cause for concern. If i\u2019m not in brest this fall, i\u2019ll have a disband","But speaking of work ethic, i am gone until tomorrow (for real this time). Let\u2019s reconvene in the morning","Ok sounds good","So...Yoda really did not take kindly to my confession. I retaliated with \u201cif you don\u2019t trust me, so be it! But i\u2019m not going to just roll over and let you dominate this game\u201d\n\nYou can cement Yoda\u2019s trust of you in the morning by reporting that I\u2019ve approached you with a plan. We can talk about what form that plan should take, or you can just feed Yoda anything but the truth. \n\nChewbacca is on board with the stab just fyi. Happy to leave Brest if they\u2019re to be believed, and I think they are.","Ok. Where did Chewbacca say he would go from Bre?","Gas. That\u2019s still the plan right?","Updates on my end: Chewbacca asked for my preference on where to go. I told Yoda this. I asked Yoda what i should say back. Yoda said it shouldn\u2019t matter because he believes Chewbacca is lying.","Yes, Gas is the plan.","Well if you tell Chewbacca anything other than gas I look like a liar","I will tell Chewbacca Gas as well. And it seems like Yoda is indifferent about what I say, so it shouldn\u2019t raise any eyebrows there.","Now what plan would hypothetical you approach me with??","I *don\u2019t* think you should tell Yoda Chewbacca\u2019s real move. Is it too late?","Gimme a bit to fabricate a good hypothetical plan...","Not too late. But then i worry about what to tell Chewbacca. I suppose if Chewbacca is a spy we\u2019re doomed anyways. But it would be bad to be found out before the stab.","What if i just don\u2019t respond to Chewbacca?","Also, i\u2019m going to ask Yoda for any update on the state of belgium as if I haven\u2019t received a plan from you yet. And then when we\u2019re ready with the plan i\u2019ll say you messaged me.","If Chewbacca is a spy we\u2019re royally fucked. I\u2019m 95% sure that\u2019s not the case.","Please lie to Yoda","I will. Should i reply to Chewbacca though?","Also i think when you have a fake plan, you should type the message up to me like you\u2019re asking for real. That way i have it on hand to send to Yoda.","Okay. Please reply to Chewbacca. I\u2019m going to sleep","I told Chewbacca. If Yoda asks what i told Chewbacca, i will say something different. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ask.","Hi Obi-Wan Kenobi,\nI know that the last thing I said to you was that a partnership between us wouldn't work out, but I've had a genuine change of heart. The reason for that is that I think Yoda is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Yoda has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger. \nIf you're tired of being manipulated in a game Yoda feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Yoda on their path to victory. This proposal involves Chewbacca, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Yoda. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting me. If I were really trying to trick you, I wouldn't ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both. But frankly I consider knocking Yoda down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us. \nMy proposal is: NWG-Cly, Nth convoy Hol-Yor, Eng-IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre-Eng, Pic-Bre, Par-Pic, Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (I figure I'm about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens I'll disband my Hel fleet)\nNext year we'll be well-positioned to boot Yoda off the island and the iberian. What do you think?","(this part is not for copy-pasting to Yoda) I designed this plan to make it look safe for Yoda to convoy Gas-Lvp. I know this is what they'd really like to do. I think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this. I know it's a riskier move trying to assist Bre into Mao but I think it's the right one. I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Yoda doesn't try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Yoda out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build. That part of the fake plan is actually true","Yoda is telling me to expect a bounce in Bre. So that\u2019s not consistent with the convoy idea. Maybe he\u2019s lying?","But i haven\u2019t sent the plan yet","So all he says is \"expect a bounce\"? He could think *I'm* going to try and take it from you. And this could be further misdirection about the convoy.","Yoda can't make a bounce if we attack Mao and Gas at the same time, which the real plan has us doing","That\u2019s fair, it could be a bounce we expect from you. Keep in mind that the Chewbacca fleet disbands in the fall, assuming it leaves Bre. So if it gets into MAO, it will then vacate by spring","Better to vacate Mao than Gas, I think.","Hmm, i mean if we really think it\u2019s a convoy, disrupting the convoy is a great option. You\u2019re saying i support Bre from channel? And let me see how Yoda responds to the message","Yes, you'd support Bre from the channel. and Bel will support the channel.","I also don\u2019t think hitting NAO makes sense. Then we won\u2019t be able to take Lvp next spring","sometimes it's like you don't even read my messages. I acknowledge that. We'd have to wait til fall. I'm making a sacrifice too by convoying to york instead of Edi, and I'm willing to do that because I think it's the right move. Even if there's not a convoy, there's still a chance you fall into Nao which is advantageous.","The way I see it we don't stand a chance unless we can take mao and start beating Yoda back into the mediterranean","You didn\u2019t make it clear that Yor was a real move.","I said: \"In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build\", how can I get clearer than that?","Whoops haha. I\u2019m still in bed looking on my phone and it\u2019s a lot of text.","I know. Sorry, I get wordy when I'm on the war path","It\u2019s quite alright. Do you think it\u2019s worth saying anything to Darth Vader? If you\u2019re confident that the convoy is the move, what additional edge do we get by sharing fake info?","You mean to Yoda? I do think it's worth it, because Yoda will realize that I'll turn to you if I'm no longer allied with him. By reporting the plan, you cement Yoda's trust in *you*. If you didn't report the plan, Yoda'd suspect you. It also gives Yoda a false sense of confidence in what I'll do.\n\nTentative request: after the stab goes through, do I have your permission to send Yoda the quotes from Yoda that you've sent me? Yoda went to *such lengths* to defend himself and make *me* feel guilty for questioning him, and the sheer hypocrisy of it is so revolting. I want to throw his own betrayal back in his face. I figure he's not going to trust you after the stab anyway.","furthermore, Yoda may respond to my plan by offering *you* moves to counter it, and you can bet that the moves offered will turn to Yoda's benefit. We can see if these moves keep you away from Mao and Nao, which will further confirm Yoda's got his eyes on the convoy","Ok i have to get to campus. Let me send the quote to Yoda and then i\u2019ll process all this and respond later.","Oh and one more thing: as long as we think the convoy is the real move, we also know that Spain is gonna support Mao, unless Yoda is really really cocky. So I'll need to support you into Bre with Paris to make sure you get there. This means Burgundy will have to try for Gas unsupported, but again, if we're confident the convoy is the play i'm willing to risk it","I've told Chewbacca the new move is to Mao and Chewbacca confirmed. So, the moves the plan needs from you are:\n\nEng s Bre-Mao (Bel will support Eng holding)\nPic-Bre (Paris will support)\nNwy-Swe\nNwg-Nao\n\nLet me know if you take issue with any of these, or if you ever hear back from Yoda. \nWe have a shot that at least one of these moves will get us somewhere. But I recognize this plan is nowhere near as sure a thing as if you just cooperated with Yoda. I want to give you one last chance to back out.","Alright I'm online now. Give me a moment to process everything.","Ok, all of this looks good to me.","Great! Note that you actually gain a build with this plan. So even if the move to Nao doesn't pan out, you can just build an army in Edi and use that to take back lvp","Yeah that's what I'm thinking. If we dislodge the convoy, I get two! You really think Yoda won't try to snag Por?","Entered moves:\nF ENG S Bre - MAO\nF NWG - NAO\nF Nwy - Swe\nA Pic - Bre","If they're convoying, I would bet not. If they're not convoying, then perhaps, but I think an open Mao is still better than an Yoda mao. \n\nThose moves look good! No word from Yoda?","From Yoda: \"Okay, I think that\u2019s the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.\"","wait, he thinks *what* is the right move?","I said I'd agree to your proposal but instead move to London and Edi, expecting one of them to bounce.","Brilliant. Let's hope he buys it","He definitely trusts me, which is why I think no support from Spa is a possibility. Like if he really trusts me going to london, why wouldn't he go for it?","Also, I'm really hoping you won't lose Mun. That would cause some problems.","Can you copy in your set of moves just so I can see the summary? If there's any you want to strike from the record out of paranoia, I totally understand.","Full record:\nF Bel S ENG\n\nA Bur - Gas\n\nF HEL - Kie\n\nA Hol - Yor\n\nA Mun - Tyr\n\nF NTH C Hol - Yor\n\nA Par S Pic - Bre","Cool. I guess the support in Bel is only relevant if MAO surprises with supporting Bre in or something like that","right and I have a weird bias for having my units *do* something other than hold.","I also wanted to talk post-war relations since you brought that up. My ideal would be total silence to Yoda from both of us. As tempting as it is to gloat, Yoda will use any gloating we do to convince others on the board that we're schemers, unreliable, sharing intel at an absurd level etc.","We also should start courting R2-D2 once the moves go through","post-stab relations*","we can try to court R2-D2, but should do so with extreme trepidation lest anything get shared with Yoda","Yeah no sharing of specific moves with R2-D2, at least not at the beginning. But the alliance is natural since I'm moving against Luke Skywalker and we're both moving against Yoda. And we really want it to be a solid 3 on 2.","Nicely done. Thoughts on the silence to Yoda idea?","Also, R2-D2 just took a beating","Accurate. We should sent condolences their way.","And I won't speak to Yoda","Ok. I won't either. He's going to be sending some nasty-grams our way I'm sure.","yeah if you get a juicy one send it to me!","ugh I'm kicking myself I wish i'd supported Bur-Gas. But hindsight's 20\/20","So maybe try to cool it with Luke Skywalker...I'm thinking we're gonna need to go 4 on one if we want a shot at stopping him","Yeah i\u2019ll try to be amicable with Luke Skywalker. I feel like you\u2019ll have more sway since you didn\u2019t just take his territory","Yoda just said \u201cwell played\u201d","Well he's correct about that","And I'm trying to make overtures to Luke Skywalker and R2-D2 right now","Haha yeah. I agree that taking down Yoda will be tough even if he\u2019s operating mostly alone.","Yoda to me: \"Well, this game just got less fun\"","Haha. Still figuring out what builds will be. Trying to piece together a plan to get you a build from Yoda this year, but it looks like that may be a challenge. We'll have to make a couple of good guesses.","I think your builds are pretty obvious, right? Fleet in Lvp, army in Edi? \nIn spring, I'll support Edi into Lvp. Meanwhile Lvp moves IRI with support from the channel and Nwg pokes Nao.","With your permission, I'll move Nth-Edi and then Edi-Cly in the fall. This way we can shove Yoda out of Nao come next spring.","I agree with the builds, and I'll review the tactics. We really need an Yoda disband this year to break the line. With what you've presented we won't get Spa or Mar, and by next spring we may have Yoda in Lyo and Wes. Not sure if we have a better option on our end, but I'll keep thinking.","Right I don't think there's much we can do about the south besides get one of us in gascony and put a fleet in Brest and hope for the best.","Nevermind: it's better I think to risk Yoda in Nwg, since that's actually not a huge threat. Nwg should go to Edi and Nth should go to Lon. Dammit, we'd be in such a better position if I hadn't been so paranoid that Luke Skywalker would move to Munich! Then I'd have kept my fleet in Hel","Was just running through some tactics. I think I found an issue, but I want to check with you. Suppose Yoda ends up with Fleet in Portugal, army in spain, fleet in lyo, fleet in wes, army mar. I think this is a stalemate line. And I don't think we can do anything to stop Yoda from forming it.","I mean you could mess with North Africa from MAO I guess. But at that point we're looking at Tunis as the next build on our front. And that only works if neither NAO nor IRI gets behind the line.","Fingers crossed you can find a flaw in my thinking.","I guess the point is that no amount of cleverness is going to get us those dots until we see disbands (if my thinking is correct, of course)","I think you\u2019re right\u2014if dots is what you\u2019re after, you\u2019re better off stabbing me and Luke Skywalker than collaborating. But I think you\u2019ll that just getting Yoda under control takes priority. Luke Skywalker and R2-D2 might see some dots, but if we do it\u2019ll take a lot longer","I agree i could stab Luke Skywalker with moves on st p or something. I\u2019m not in great tactical position to stab you right now if i wanted to. No question that Yoda\u2019s the target. But we\u2019ll be dancing with those fleets until they\u2019re off the board from a loss of supply centers. That changes my thinking about our moves a bit.","I know for a fact we can disband at least one of the fleets. I ran quite a few sandboxes in lieu of working today and I'll share moves in the morning.","Yeah if you found one, that\u2019s great. Let me know","woah, all armies from Yoda. I guess I was seeing things through the lens of the worst he could do to us.","Given that the beta test ends in 1909, what are your goals? Just duke it out until then?","was not aware of that! But yeah, I'll just go down fighting Yoda like hopefully everyone else.","That's pretty disappointing this game was just getting good","Yeah admin said this in the general thread a while back. I agree it\u2019s a bit of a shame to see it cut short. But i suppose we\u2019re just the beta testers. I will be glad to be finished though. It was fun, but like WAY too much distraction and stress haha.","Would you play online again after all this?","I\u2019m not sure I would.","I think I would! you're right that it's way too much distraction but, hey, it keeps me off the streets","Hmm something tells me that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise be out committing violent crimes haha. But then again how well do i really know you from playing a lying game. I will say I\u2019d be down to do an in-person one with CS students at some point.","Btw all other powers (me included) will be setting for a 5-way draw this move.","I had been thinking the same thing! Do you know anyone besides me and admin at UMD who plays?\n\nUh huh...sureee they will","AFAIK there's no drawback to submitting the draw order (if you're ok with the outcome). If there's not consensus, play just continues as normal. Well I think admin' adviser has played. I know [redacted] had expressed interest in playing. Not sure about students though.","And I'm sure I could recruit a couple of non-UMD friends to play.","I'm on board with the five-way draw, by the way. \n\nAnd I think there's a couple board game enthusiasts in my lab who may not have played this particular game before but would probably like it...if you don't mind playing with new people","Yeah always down to play with new folks. And I\u2019m down for the draw as well","Reply all to Yoda's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Yoda claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.",":\u2019( we were supposed to hug it out!! Any idea who wasn\u2019t on board?","Sorry for not coordinating moves. I really thought the game was gonna be over","So did I! And I have no clue who wasn't on board","I guess we try the draw again?? I suppose it\u2019s possible a game could be set up to not support the regular draw settings. I dunno.","Not sure your interest level in the game at this point, but we should at least make sure Yoda doesn\u2019t win right?","can Yoda take five centers this turn??","Nah, but maybe admin will be like \u201coh btw let\u2019s go until 1914 now!\u201d.","Any guesses on who is holding out on the draw?","who keeps screwing with the draw though! Do you think Yoda suggested it just to mess with all of us?","oh haha we just asked the same thing","That\u2019s my best guess. He\u2019s kind of the only one with the incentive to keep it going. And with his winning track record, probably the only one who cares enough to be this sneaky","well I'm honestly not invested enough to care if that happens anyway","I\u2019m not very invested either, but i\u2019d rather not see Yoda win, especially if this is how he did it","well let me know if there's anything you want me to do, then","Ok, will do. We\u2019ve got a day before the next move","I think","Ok would you be up for: Paris support Brest Hold, and then get one of your fleets into the channel? And then don't go to Nth as I'll be moving Nth to NWG and Denmark to Nth to make sure he can't break through in the north? Yor holds?","Pic support Brest hold as well would guarantee that he can't take it from the channel.","Pic needs to support paris but other than that Ok","Pic can't, since it's a fleet.","I'm supporting paris from brest","oh right---ok thanks","And actually can Yor support Wales?","Yep!","Great! Glad we're doing this since I think otherwise Yoda has a serious shot at 18 by the end of 1910.","Wait I'm actually doing our moves wrong if we want to hold paris. I need to attack Gas from Bre. Otherwise, Eng cuts Bre support, Gas supports Bur to Par. So I'm going to do that instead.","I'm doing my moves wrong*","Par to Gas is a good move paired with that. Cuts support for either the Bre or Par attack from Yoda, and the armies will bounce right back to where they came from. Up to you though.","Looks like it all worked. A little surprised about the supported move into brest. Do you want it?","Looking at the board a bit more, we'll have to be clever to keep Yoda from any more centers on our side of the board. I think the following will do it: Bre and Par to Gas, Ruh to Bur, channel to MAO, NTH to NWG. We can ask Luke Skywalker to attack Tyr to cut support (Tri is going to fall anyways). I can hold the island as long as Yor doesn't attack me.","The Brest support was just in case Yoda moves Gas into Brest supported by Eng. I should have realized that with Lon moving to Eng that move would not have gone through anyway, but I'm not paying as much attention to this game anymore.","And okay your plan seems to make sense but

{"messages":["Hey there. What are your thoughts on an anti-Obi-Wan Kenobi opening, like a sea lion, as Darth Vader? If you enjoy something like that then we might make good allies.","Bonjour--not sure what a 'sea lion' is!","It's when a lion is stranded at sea, like in the life of pi.","That was a tiger. Let me know what you'd like me to do--I imagine it involves letting you take Belgium?","Good point. Sea tiger sounds more menacing anyway. \n\nIt all depends on how you like to play Darth Vader and your relationship with Luke Skywalker. I can be flexible, and if it makes sense for me to have Belgium to set up for a future play then that is good with me.","Admittedly, I've never played this game before! Don't go spreading that around","You sound experienced for someone who is playing the game for the first time- I'm sure few people would be able to tell.","I appreciate that, mon ami!","Nice moves. What are your thoughts on the map?","Well I'm wondering what you're up to in Burgundy, for starters","Haha. I was looking to secure a position on Belgium and it seemed like the best way to do it. Depending on your plans, I could take Belgium with Burgundy, which could set us up nicely to work together","Sorry for the late reply, the bot was down.","I think taking Belgium with Burgundy would be wise","That sounds ominous. What are your thoughts on Obi-Wan Kenobi","Any plans for Holland? Would you want to support Burgundy to Belgium? It's hard to read you and I'm not sure what you are planning","So much for being wise \ud83d\ude02  \ud83d\ude02","Can we have a conversation at some point? I'd love to figure things out with you","Sorry--I was out last night and couldn't answer your questions!\n\nI was cagey because I still have no sense of who to trust and who not to. But I'd like to trust you if you think you can trust me too. I understand if not because of my unannounced visit to Burgundy...I was just attempting to have some insurance in case there was funny business","Thanks for getting back to me- and no worries. Hopefully when the deadline is moved away from midnight it will be a bit easier lol.  To be totally fair to you, you never actually said you wouldn't move to Burgundy. For me it isn't a trust issue but a communication issue, which I think can be easily fixed.","Have you been talking to Obi-Wan Kenobi at all?","I did: Obi-Wan Kenobi tried to make a deal with me to take Belgium (I was supposed to support E's move from the north sea while attacking Burgundy), but we both reneged.","I see. I ask since I have a feeling Obi-Wan Kenobi might be playing us against eachother. He also asked for support to Belgium Lol. For now I'm building armies, but maybe we can get to a point where we can re-establish a border between us.","I'd rather settle the matter of Burgundy diplomatically rather than with force. Any chance you will consider withdrawing from Burgundy?","The one thing I think neither of us can afford is a war of armies. We would be giving away the entire ocean to Obi-Wan Kenobi's units, and there's an Yoda\/R2-D2n coalition growing that will be a concern in the long run","I gotta say Chewbacca, right now it seems like the best move for me is to work against you so I\u2019m not so hemmed in.","That said, I\u2019m no strategist. What are your thoughts?","Let's say you built armies in Munich and Kiel and started marching in my direction. These armies can't go on water, they can't move past Gascony\/Paris\/Marseilles as my units will soon be there, and so the only places to go for your armies are Ruhr... and that's about it. Isn't this a huge traffic jam? Wouldn't you be hemming yourself in even more by building armies? That's what I mean by it will be devastating to both of us to get into an army war and let Obi-Wan Kenobi control the entire ocean. We're bidding over such a small area of land.","One option for we could consider is that I could dislodge your army and you could choose to remove it from the board. That way, you could build it in a place where you might need it more if you are feeling hemmed-in.","No thanks, I don't think that's in my best interest right now","Ok. Sounds like you've already made up your mind about things. Let me know when that changes.","Not sure what your plan is. I'm covering Marseilles, Paris, and Belgium so you have no chance to take a supply center this turn.","The bot was down but I meant to contact you earlier","You put up quite a strong defense against me, which I'm sure was your goal","I was suprised you retreated to Munich over Marseilles that one turn but it worked out for you","I want to help you protect your supply centers if that is alright with you.","Why do you want to help me?","I'm worried about Obi-Wan Kenobi, and you are frankly one of the only things stopping him from attacking me. I'm just looking at it rationally: what is Obi-Wan Kenobi going to do with all those fleets? I wish we were able to work something out so that both of us would have some fleets at least. But rihgt now Obi-Wan Kenobi has 4 fleets and you have 1 and I have 2. And he's going to blow up your fleet in Holland this turn, it's basically a guarantee.","Let's say he gets 2 builds and builds 2 fleets. Am I going to be able to stop him, even if Luke Skywalker and I team up? He'll dominate the entire ocean.","At that point, it really won't matter how many supply centers I take from you because I won't be able to prevent an Obi-Wan Kenobi fleet invasion.","I mean, what are your thoughts on the whole situation?","We should talk more. I'm not lying about wanting to help you, but it's hard because you aren't talking to me, and everything you have done so far this game seems to have been against me.","well fat lot of good it's done me. I think you're right about the danger of letting Obi-Wan Kenobi control the sea. But I'm not sure what I in my current state can do about it","Can Helgoland Blight move to the North Sea? This would cut support, allowing me to take the Obi-Wan Kenobi Channel.","It could, but that would leave holland undefended","Hmm. That's a good point. And Kiel is probably busy defending Berlin\/Munich since Luke Skywalker is in the Baltic and Silesia and could double team you with Yoda. It's funny, there are so many units at your doorstep, but you might end up keeping all your dots this turn.","I assumed you were working with Obi-Wan Kenobi somewhat after last turn, since it seemed like he could have guaranteed Holland and chose not to.","If supporting Munich is what is preventing Kiel from blocking Holland, I can support Munich","That wouldn't be enough: I need to defend munich *and* berlin somehow and there's no way to do both without Kiel","Yeah, you are right, I can't think of a way to do it either. No worries, we can try something next turn depending on how the moves turn out.","Well. You did well for yourself that turn \ud83d\ude42. Really impressive diplomacy","I want to apologize for entering Ruhr- I wasn't sure what else to do honestly. I should have given you a heads up and that's my fault. I'm sorry.","And it's ended up being doubly bad as now I'm a turn behind in terms of defending myself with Yoda coming after Iberia and all. sigh.","I think we are at the point where we should talk about working together. If you want a decent result, I think your best bet is to work with me.","I honestly do, since I think your growth potential is going to be limited by the fact that we both have way too many armies and not enough fleets. So this means that your growth is limited to Paris\/Belgium, and that's if you make it past 4 armies.","What I'm trying to say is that the big winners are Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi.","We're the big losers. There's almost nothing we can do. Unless Luke Skywalker, you, and I plug the holes in our defenses by working together.","Have you talked to Luke Skywalker at all about this?","What would you want me to do this year?","Hi Chewbacca--wanted to confirm our plan for this season and next: I disrupt Nth support from Holland, and in exchange you'll kindly scooch out of Belgium in the fall (into Ruhr, I imagine)? At which point I'll build a fleet in Holland?","Actually, I'd have to build the fleet in Kiel, I think","1. I have. We're both trying our best to defend ourselves from Obi-Wan Kenobi- we're too far from eachother for tactical manuevering but so far we've managed to avoid any losses","2. Despite Yoda incoming invasion, I am still completely focused on taking the Channel, as that will give me much needed breathing room. If Holland can move to the North Sea, it will cut support and I will take EC","3. I am withdrawing from Ruhr. I know this leaves me open to you taking it back and working with Obi-Wan Kenobi to capture Belgium in the fall. I can't think of another way to get you a center, so my promise is that if the board doesn't shake up somehow I'll give you Belgium either this turn or next turn on the condition that you build a fleet","That's correct, you can build a fleet from Kiel or from Berlin but not from Holland. You need to make sure one of those is vacated during the Winter phase. Vacating Kiel can be dangerous as Obi-Wan Kenobi is in Denmark and could in theory take Kiel from you.","I will vacate Belgium in the fall for you. Not yet sure what the best way to do it would be to make sure we don't lose it or Holland to an Obi-Wan Kenobi fleet.","I know Obi-Wan Kenobi has their eye on sweden so we'll see how that baltic region shapes up next turn and that will determine where I build my fleet.","it's risky, but I think I'll be safe leaving Berlin vulnerable to Luke Skywalker in the fall...let me know if you hear\/think otherwise when that time comes","Will do. I definitely agree, I spoke with Luke Skywalker briefly and I believe he intends to leave you alone from now on.","Good guy Luke Skywalker. sorry if you've been watching me type, I've been starting to ask you questions and then confirming their answers for myself in a sandbox! \ud83d\ude02","No worries. Feel free to ask anyhing- though the sandbox is really helpful too \ud83d\ude42","Okay--real question: assuming you take the channel with Brest an then Obi-Wan Kenobi retreats to London, aren't you going to just lose the channel anyway?","oh wait nevermind I can prevent that if I keep my fleet in Holland and prevent Nth support twice. But this means I need to move Kiel into Ruhr during the spring to take my sweet, promised belgium in the fall. Picardy will have to support my movement of Ruhr into Belgium and you'll have to disband the unit. That's all fine, right?","BUUUT Obi-Wan Kenobi could foresee this and support with the london fleet and move with Nth...in which case, at least they lose Nth, I guess.","Great point. I will have to disband a unit anyway in the fall after losing Belgium, so it won't matter if I need to pull it.","Losing the channel might be rough, that's true. Hmm, I actually hadn't thought too much about it. I think if he does that at the very least I can retreat into Wales and threaten Liverpool (assuming that Wales goes to cover London)","Give me a reason to defend myself against Yoda. As it stands, I'm just going to let him solo.","What do you think Yoda is going to do once he kills me?","Don't you agree that R2-D2 will need somewhere to go with all his armies?","I swear. I'm trying my hardest to work with you.","Look. I will defend myself against Yoda. But I need to know that I will be in the draw. If you and Obi-Wan Kenobi are just going to fuck me from behind, then there is no incentive for me to defend myself against Yoda.","Hey, I really am sorry about the stab. You probably won't believe me but let me explain myself:\n\nI knew I was making a deal with the devil when I agreed to help Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, R2-D2, and Luke Skywalker were\/are basically all allied and I figured it was either you or me they turned on. The turning point was when I realized that after I stab Obi-Wan Kenobi you might not even hold the channel anyway. I couldn't afford to risk fury from all sides. \n\nBut now I'm in a potentially very good position for you: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda *trust* me. I am in the process of finding out--under no suspicion, mind you, because of our alliance and shared plans--their moves for this season. Once I learn those, I can relay them to you.","Doing so would clearly be in my interest. The longer you're in the running, the longer I escape getting devoured myself on three or more fronts.","If you manage to look just lucky or smart by making the right moves to counter their attacks this season, I can continue to double-agent and help keep you defended and possibly even expanded into Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nI just spoke with Obi-Wan Kenobi and I can confirm that you will be able to take the channel if you want to--they're supporting me into Belgium from Nth. \n\nI can't be as direct asking this of Yoda, but I'm trying to figure out whether they're going to use the lion's share of their force against Marseilles or Spain. If I can figure this out you may have a better chance of holding.\n\nI'm going to send the info your way whether you believe me or not.","Ok. I get that- I'm sorry for not explaining it well. Losing the channel doesn't matter to me. It gives me excellent retreat options and allows me to defend myself against Yoda without worrying about what Obi-Wan Kenobi is up to.","There's no way Luke Skywalker is allied with Yoda and R2-D2. Just look at how aggressive R2-D2 is in attacking Luke Skywalker...","Nothing can be done at this point though. Thanks for the offer of intel- this is basically all I wanted to hear. As long as I have a chance to be in the draw I won't give up and maybe something will shake up and give me a chance to recover","You should work on Obi-Wan Kenobi- he's not even communicating with me. I must have done something to piss him off. But if he keeps this up it's going to end badly for him too.","For the future, let me know in advance when you are planning something like this. If I knew you were not cutting the North Sea I would have played this way differently by bouncing Yoda out of the West Med, and we'd be in a much stronger position.","It\u2019s not that Luke Skywalker is allied with R2-D2, but Luke Skywalker is cooperating strongly with Obi-Wan Kenobi to the point that they don\u2019t even talk to me.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I can confirm that Yoda\u2019s going to shoot for Spain.","(They meaning Luke Skywalker. I get kind of annoyed with everyone using \u201che\u201d to refer to these players)","I am sure Luke Skywalker is just uncommunicative. Since the start of the game he's only sparingly talked with me","*They've, sorry","Just given that they seem to be fighting in Scandinavia. But you probably have more information than I do.","By the way, what's the plan that Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi proposed to you in terms of your units? Are you attacking Burgundy with ruhr and Munich?","Oh that's not a fight that's planned high-fives. At least according to Obi-Wan Kenobi.\nNope--attacking Belgium with Ruhr and Amsterdam. We're in the process of discussing whether Munich should bother poking Belgium.","Burgundy*","I take back what I said about Yoda shooting for spain. I thought it was decided but Yoda wants to keep that decision to themself","Thanks. I'm probably going to flip a coin for Spain\/Marseilles. Has Obi-Wan Kenobi expressed any concern over the Yoda\/R2-D2n growth? I worry that Obi-Wan Kenobi has been charmed by Yoda. Or maybe they just dislike me that much.","YES! That worked very well. You're getting a build! Please please please build a fleet \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42","I intend to build a fleet. Are you gonna disband Pic?","woops miscounted","disband nothing","Yep, it got popped since Belgium had nowhere to retreat to.","Neat, bot is back up now. Hmm, maybe it was just the one message that was bugged somehow. Whoops. I'll copy paste it back","What do you want to do here? I am really hoping that we can coordinate something together. I think AI is starting to have some pressure put on their relationship with a greedy Yoda. I understand Obi-Wan Kenobi is in a tough position where their best move is probably to stay put and do nothing, which is always a tough sell (I just wish they would actually read my messages instead of sabotaging my ability to help them fight Yoda)","I checked out Yoda's history. He's [redacted] from playdiplomacy.com. he's ranked the number one player on the entire site, and that's probably the most popular Diplomacy site of them all","If we don't stop this here he's going to solo. No question.","Sorry for the gendered pronouns- I keep forgetting to neutralize them sometimes since I've played with some of these players before in FTF","Yeah lol. I'm totally fine with Obi-Wan Kenobi in my territory honestly","They have been fun to work with while it lasted, they seem transparent and honest. I'd trust","Anonymity is tough to keep up with the discord names and the fact that the usernames are in the Backstabbr too. That being said, I didn't mean to upset you if you're uncomfortable discussing that- if it makes it better I have ignored it completely until I recently found out about the published names. It doesn't have to be a discussion point, it's pretty clear by now that Yoda knows what they are doing.","Haha. Fair enough, that is true, it is unfair. I'm totally guilty of accidentally assuming masculine pronouns in online games, and I'm working on changing that since it is a big issue. It's good to do as a default and I appreciate that you brought it up. I think R2-D2, Yoda, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and I know eachother, albeit with varying degrees of familiarity.","I know you were joking a bit when you said anonymity did you no good in this game, but seriously, I think you are playing great. I would have never guessed you are a first time player. Are you really sweat_smile? You are playing extremely well","Any news from Obi-Wan Kenobi? I hope that they will consider working to stop Yoda","I messaged them but haven't heard yet","Ok here's what I  know:\nObi-Wan Kenobi is going to keep away from Luke Skywalker's northern holdings for a while in order to avoid feeding R2-D2. However, The Norway fleet is headed for MAO for the start of next year, and Obi-Wan Kenobi is very much still intent on seeing you consumed. Yoda has told me definitively which of your centers is getting full force this turn (under some pretense about needing to coordinate so me and Obi-Wan Kenobi could be more effective) and it's Spain. I'm going to hold and support Belgium and move Kie-Ruh with support.","I'm also going to poke Bur","Thanks so much for the info. Will do. Any chance you go to Tyrolia instead of poking Burgundy? It won't matter for me that much but for you it could save a lot of headache and potentially exacerbate AI tensions","Alternatively a written commitment from Yoda not to go to Tyrolia would be smart","I'm not ready for Yoda not to trust me anymore. I'll try to see about that commitment though...","That turn went well for you. With Luke Skywalker out of Silesia you certainly have more breathing room. Only downside may be Yoda in Tyrolia, but hopefully they committed to not moving there or at least are aware that you aren't ok with it hanging out there. Thanks to you, Yoda has ground to a halt in southern Chewbacca. I'm hoping we can repeat it again this turn.\n\nYou should ask Obi-Wan Kenobi for Denmark. If they say no, no big deal. But it should be yours- they are the ones that took it from you. And it's significantly hampering your manueveravility and ability to build units where you want to as it borders the extremely important Kiel.","Yoda offered not to move into Tyr, but gave a good justification for why they weren't interested in attacking Munich, so I let them.\n\nI just asked Obi-Wan Kenobi about Denmark. \n\nAs for Yoda, I'll have to come up with the right pretense to extract their plans again this turn...maybe you could help me with that? Obi-Wan Kenobi and me are pretty much in the routine of sharing moves though so you're at least guaranteed those.","Sweet. Assuming Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Yoda want you to move into Burgundy, you could pretend to be worried that I might bounce you out of Burgundy and ask if Yoda has some moves that can help occupy my units in Marseilles and Gascony.","Any updates by any chance?","I\u2019m waiting to hear from Yoda","Any info you think might help me in defending against Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda? My plan is literally giving you all my centers while Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi get nothing, since I can't defend all three and you are the only one who has been helping me.","I'm assuming Obi-Wan Kenobi is going all in and moving to NAO, maybe even to Irish and Channel?","Right, Obi-Wan Kenobi is moving to NAO but otherwise holding everything this turn. No deal on Denmark, unfortunately. Next year will be a play for MAO.\n\nAnd Yoda is deadset on randomizing their move, so I'm sorry I don't have intel for you this time--I did try, though: Obi-Wan Kenobi (at my suggestion) offered to assist Yoda into MAO, but Yoda refused.","Thanks","And as for me, I'll be taking Bur.","Darn, that went poorly.","It was a coin toss; nothing you could have done. I didn't foresee (or know about) the move to Naf but in hindsight it makes perfect sense.","It's kind of a privilege getting to watch Yoda play, esp. knowing who he is","Yeah for sure. Hey but thanks for all your help. I'd have died a lot sooner if not for you.","It's been a pleasure! Thanks for playing with a newb \ud83d\ude03","If you're having fun, I'd encourage you to check out face to face games in your local area. Online is great, but FTF is really something else \ud83d\ude42.","Anyway, I'd like to be a part of the discussion for how to distribute my dots. I'd ideally like this to go in a way where it sets up you and Yoda nicely to take out Obi-Wan Kenobi and R2-D2","I see this game lasting longer if Yoda receives as few dots as possible...what's your reasoning for favoring I over E?","I am pretty sure Obi-Wan Kenobi will stab you once they are done killing me. Yoda has R2-D2 to deal with. But Obi-Wan Kenobi has nowhere to go. MAO is a huge stalemate line. Yoda can litterally have a unit in Spain, Portugal, and MAO, not to mention Wmed and NaF, and there is nothing Obi-Wan Kenobi or you can do to get past that line.","If you and Obi-Wan Kenobi were going to be a long term alliance, Obi-Wan Kenobi needed to be in the MAO helping me keep the lines years ago. At this point even if I give Obi-Wan Kenobi all my dots, Yoda has enough units to the point where it's locked up. So that's the logical reason, but there's also the fact that Obi-Wan Kenobi hasn't replied to my messages in over ten seasons and I have evidence of then working closely with Yoda. I think that's a pretty big indication that they will hand Yoda dots and have no intention or interest in working with me.","In the end I probably am eliminated either way, so if you want to give Obi-Wan Kenobi a shot then I can swing that way. But I'd highly recommend against it even though I'm sure you trust Obi-Wan Kenobi very much.","Okay, I see your point about MAO and Obi-Wan Kenobi having nowhere to go.","Thanks for disbanding Pic--that helps me out a lot!\nAre you speaking with Yoda at all about your plans?","Nope, Yoda hasn't replied.","Yoda just told me as much too. Says they don't trust you...but your track record with me has been pretty good so I want to continue to work with you. \n...and actually, I've been seriously mulling over a backstab of Obi-Wan Kenobi this turn and I was wondering if you would want to help. Specifically, if you think that MAO is destined for Yoda anyway, I'll support you into the channel. Meanwhile, I'll move a fleet into Hel and an army to Kiel to prepare to swipe denmark. \nI haven't entirely thought this through, but what do you think?","That sounds great! If we knew Obi-Wan Kenobi orders, we could potentially come up with an even deadlier plan. I'll have to think more about it, but if Obi-Wan Kenobi convoys into Brest again, I could move Brest to Picardy to let it in, and bounce NAO. With Yoda dislodging MAO, I could then retreat to the Irish Sea and take Liverpool while Paris, Picardy, and Gascony could reclaim Brest. This would have the advantage of not making moves that would give away the stab in the spring.","So I'm Paris in that scenario right? \nAnd I'm talking with Obi-Wan Kenobi about their orders right now. They want to take IRI this turn, actually, and want me to support Nth into the channel. If I agree, they actually prefer to move Nwg into Nth than try for Nao. *That's* how unwilling they are to just give me denmark back!","Oh wow, I see. Hmm, well looking at the map I think this would still work. We'd need to find a way to make sure Obi-Wan Kenobi can't take Holland in the fall (or we could just risk it). I think it makes sense to move Brest to the Obi-Wan Kenobi Channel instead of MAO so that I have the option to retreat somewhere valuable (like into NAO).","These moves guarantee Denmark but Obi-Wan Kenobi could retreat to Sweden, which is something to be aware about.","I agree about Brest-Eng. But me and Obi-Wan Kenobi are still hammering stuff out so it's not final yet...","Breaking news: Obi-Wan Kenobi has decided (or at least has told me) that they don't want to try for IRI anymore. Instead, they're planning to convoy into Brest or Pic (I'm waiting on their reply to confirm which), poke Nao from Nwg, and otherwise hold\/support as appropriate","ugh. sorry but the plan changed again: Obi-Wan Kenobi is going to poke Nao, but otherwise just hold everything. No convoy. \n\nI can still move Brest into the Channel if you want, and if you *really* want to irk Obi-Wan Kenobi you can move to IRI. If I also set myself up for Denmark like I said, I'd have to move Ruhr into Holland to defend there, leaving my southeast pretty exposed, but I think that's a reasonable risk right now.  What do you think?","There's also a nonzero chance that Obi-Wan Kenobi is lying to me...they seemed pretty suspicious of me this time around compared to previous conversations. However, I'm pretty certain they're not lying about not trying to convoy; they're really insecure about you getting close to the island and not having anyone there to defend it.","You're retreating to Portugal, right? If you can poke Mao from Brest, you may be able to defend spain. And if Yoda does something crafty so that you end up falling into Mao, I can fall into\/bump Obi-Wan Kenobi from Brest?","huh. So you *really* don't like Obi-Wan Kenobi, I guess?","Darn, I missed this message actually, I should have told you what I was planning. I think Yoda had Spain guaranteed with MAO-Portugal and Marseilles-Spain with 2 supports. Yoda actually then offered me on retreating to the Irish Sea, and in exchange we would collaborate on dislodging the Obi-Wan Kenobi Channel. I figured it would benefit you as well since this would prevent Obi-Wan Kenobi from getting off of the island (if they were to convoy to Belgium or something).","Oh good--glad to hear Yoda's talking with you! \n...but Obi-Wan Kenobi could retreat to Pic?","We're not talking much, it was kind of a spontaneous thing. You are right to be concerned about the retreat to Picardy. I'll have to see if that can be avoided somehow. If not, it's not the end of the world. If absolutely needed I can just not support the supposed Yoda move to the Channel, which may or may not happen anyway.","Anyway, you also have a guess- kind of. Not sure about what you've told Obi-Wan Kenobi about the last moves, but perhaps they will use the North Sea to support Denmark to hold, in which case the support can be cut from Belgium.","That was one of a few scenarios I was thinking about. But I gotta say, I don't like the idea of Yoda in the channel. I thought *you* were going to be there. Did Yoda give a reason why they want it?","Is it okay if I ask Yoda about it?","That's fair. It might be best to not ask Yoda directly, but that is up to you (just because it seemed that if Yoda is actually serious about this proposal, they would want the element of surprise). Yoda wants to do this probably because they want to take the gamble and hope that it will shake up the West a little bit. They didn't actually say that, but it is what I infer.","I did end up asking...couldn't handle the suspense! And ever since I heard about it I've been wondering if there's some plotting I could do to turn this to my and your advantage at the expense of both Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yoda said they wouldn't do it if I didn't want them to...I'm thinking I could demand that they use WES to bounce with Obi-Wan Kenobi in MAO, which then means that the battle for Spain becomes 2 v 2 and you keep it.","That's really clever! We'd have to hope that Yoda wouldn't move MAO to Portugal, but otherwise that works well.","Meanwhile, I could support you into the channel from IRI?","Sure","Does that mean you are not going after Denmark?","Well I'm trying to gauge E's trust of me right now, so I'll see and get back to you","Any news?","Are you going to assist Yoda into the channel?","Obi-Wan Kenobi doesn\u2019t trust me, unfortunately, so I don\u2019t think I can swing anything clever","I probably will. Do you think Yoda actually intends to follow through?","I think so from talking to them, but I've been wrong before. I've come around to the idea, actually (a weekend away from this game has cleared my head!). So, should I support Brest holding from Paris? Btw, are you going to let me keep Paris?","Yep you can stay in Paris. If you can support Brest hold that would be amazing!","I'll submit the orders to support Yoda into the channel then and just see what happens","I'm sorry, Chewbacca, I made an 11th-hour deal (literally in the past two minutes) with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. I really really did not mean to deceive you","No worries, it's the game, and I think you made the right choice. As long as you aren't afraid to lie to Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Yoda :). I'm rooting for you to do well this game. Congrats on 2 builds!","Thanks. I've learned a lot from you this game, so thanks for talking with me \ud83d\ude03","Happy to. I still have one dot left, and it looks like fleet Picardy will be the most useful to you, but I can keep Gascony or something else as well. Now that all the Chewbacca centers are gone, you will have to decide between Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi.","I feel like Yoda's 10 well-defended units made that decision for me. But even if I change my mind on that, I think Pic would be the most helpful to keep","Me and Yoda are strategizing now about ousting Obi-Wan Kenobi from Brest\/the channel. Are you more willing to support one of  those two moves?","Actually, we could support you into Brest, then have you support one of us into the channel in Fall?","Sure","Moving to Brest right now","Excellent! Do you and Yoda have any kind of agreement about Portugal?","Well Yoda said that they would consider letting me keep it as long as I am useful :)","Well this move definitely is. So I hope they keep their word","Nice turn for you! I wonder what Obi-Wan Kenobi will do at this point. Based on their retreat, it looks like they could be defending London and Edinburgh so a convoy to Yorkshire or possibly even a move to Norway seem like the strongest plays","Can't believe Yoda is going to get into Liverpool.","Anyway, I'm holding in Brest for now, but let me know if I can do something else with that unit.","yeah that's an unpleasant surprise. Has Yoda promised you anything? Based on some things I've pieced together, I'm starting to realize the full extent of their manipulation of this entire game. It's honestly kind of unsettling.\n\n...I hope this can stay between us, Chewbacca, but I've got two sandboxes up right now: one where I put aside my beef with Obi-Wan Kenobi just to try and get Yoda under control, and one where I keep dancing with the devil, which I will follow through with only on the condition they agree *not* to take one of Liverpool or Portugal this year. Neither of these plans has you staying in Brest. If you're willing to do either of those things (help with an Yoda stab or more Obi-Wan Kenobi destruction) at the expense of Brest, let me know and let me know which you'd prefer. If not, well, that may tip the scales to me staying with Yoda, because I don't think we can swing the stab without your help.","Happy to order whatever you want.","I know there's no chance for me to live in this game unless someone else wants it. I think I may have some insight that's worth keeping me around. But if it makes more sense for me to go out now, I'll do it.","You're good people, Chewbacca! And I have Yoda's word that they're not taking Portugal anytime soon. Though Yoda's word is literally not worth the electric current encoding it. \n\nWhat insight are you referring to, may I ask?","Thanks. I definitely don't want to see Yoda run away with this game. Hmm, well I guess I may be able to offer insight in terms of helping with orders. I'm sure an EGR alliance can stop the AI. Mathematically we will hold 17 centers at the end of this year, which is usually the magic number to prevent a solo since you need 18 to win. Unfortunately, it doesn't leave any leeway to lose ground anywhere and more eyes on the map can be useful.","I'm assuming R2-D2 can't be turned against Yoda. I've tried for the past couple years, even organizing a 3 way convo between Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and I. I don't think R2-D2 is willing to stab Yoda.","I know I said earlier that it would make sense for you to work with Yoda, though I've admittedly changed my mind. Especially after the last orders, Yoda is nigh unstoppable if you and Obi-Wan Kenobi fight since Yoda will soon reach a critical number of units where they can defeat any opponent. Also, there are no easy stalemate lines in the West to stop them anymore really.","It's ultimately up to you though. I could see a scenario where you work with Yoda to take out Obi-Wan Kenobi, and a well timed R2-D2 stab of Yoda leaves you to establish a strong defense and get a good draw result","So, that's exactly what Yoda has promised me. However, I know for a fact that he's (Yoda has lost the courtesy of nonspecific 'they' in my book) been working with Obi-Wan Kenobi and feeding Obi-Wan Kenobi my proposed moves for this turn. (Keep that quiet, please!) \nWithout revealing that Obi-Wan Kenobi has been communicating with me, I think I *might* be about to get Yoda to confess what he's been doing. He's asked for a half hour to pick his kids up from school (despite my urging that he abandon them and respond to me now), and then he's going to respond. If he confesses, I'm going to side with Yoda. In which case I'd like you to move into the channel (where both Bel and Mao [maybe] will support your move). \nIf he doesn't, Paris will support you into Gascony. Meanwhile Eng moves IRI and Bel moves Eng. In the north, I convoy to Edi (Obi-Wan Kenobi's willing to allow me the build this winter) while Eng moves Nwg.","Sounds good.","I'm only talking to you at this point. No info will be leaked.","Convoying to Edi sounds like a good idea. I don't have context on Yoda's plan at all, but if I were him I'd probably convoy Gascony into Liverpool","Yoda is vile and even if we all die doing it I want to see him minorly inconvenienced. I\u2019d like to move forward with the anti-Yoda plan and support you into Gas","Done","Since we (me and Obi-Wan Kenobi) think that Yoda's going to try the convoy from Gas to Lvp, we actually think it's better to try and have you disrupt Mao.

{"messages":["Hello there! What's your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play R2-D2 is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don't plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.","Hey hey!  \nDon't really have much of a plan yet - like you, I generally try not to piss off too many people at the start until I get a feel for the lay of the board, so my general decision at start is really just Mos -> Ukr|StP .  Right now my default inclination is to go Ukr and try to get Rum, that may change as I talk to other players.  Happy to talk about trying to take that with fleet or army depending on how spring goes, and certainly not looking to commit to any particular long-term growth direction right now.  That being said, A\/R is one of my favorite duos (R\/F is up there too, but I don't think I've ever even seriously tried to pull that off in an online game - that's a FtF option where I know the players \ud83d\ude03 ).  \nI'm assuming standard Galicia bounce right now. happy to discuss other options.","Yeah, I was figuring standard Galicia bounce too. Keeps both of us honest.","So, here's my pitch: I have been on both sides of the deal when R2-D2, Yoda, and Luke Skywalker decide that everything would be simpler if there wasn't a Han Solo. Every time, things have indeed been simpler for A\/I\/R. So, whaddya think? Wanna simplify our game?","I literally just told Yoda to go after Han Solo first. \ud83d\ude00","Oh, fwiw, I'd just as well neither of us tried for Galicia this turn, if you don't mind.","Works fine for me.","They free people of rumania depend on your good will. I assume he's going to force Black, so... That would actually leave him pretty exposed to you and Yoda should you so desire.","I certainly won't be helping him take Rum, so I think you can survive this.","Well it looks like that worked great! I'm in a position to force Bulgaria, you're getting Sev back, and you'll be set to keep Rum. I'd appreciate it if you could support Greece to Bulgaria.","Oh, I didn't reply yet, did I?  Yes, I can give that support.","And if feel bad, except Han Solo didn't even reach out to me even once last season to try and pitch something like blowing up my fleet to try and work together later on - just completely went radio silent after the setup","Yeah, Han Solo has not been handling this fantastically.","I assume the Greece swap wasn't negotiated?","No. No it was not. There are some heated discussions happening.","What are you planning to do?","Well, I was planning on finishing off \ud83e\udd83.  Tell me what you need.","More specifically, I'm planning to take black. Other than that mostly looking to reposition North","That works just fine for me.","Yoda's really angling to get me to attack you. I've put him off from expecting anything this season. FYI.","Good to know.","Welcome back to the land of open channels. Anyway, you know you and Yoda don't have to fake fight on my account, right?","The Tyrolia move is to slow down the west, I think.","Sure, I more meant the Greece swap with attendant noise and the immediately swapping info on outside communications. \ud83d\ude00","Heh. So, you taking Ankara?","Planning on it. Then it's mostly a matter of seeing where Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Chewbacca take their relationship.","Yeah, they seems to have a bit of a clusterfuck going on. Should be fun to watch, at least \ud83d\ude1b","Indeed. How do you feel about a good old fashioned bounce over Galicia?","Sure, works for me.","No need to confirm or deny, but I assume your deal with Yoda is to convoy Greece to Smyrna.","It's been discussed, not 100% sure if it's happening","For my two cents, it's either that or you just take the second Han Solo dot for yourself. I wouldn't want him growing with armies all up along the border.","Yoda is starting to be squirrely with me. Can we avoid the bounce in Galicia? I want to get that unit moving to Vienna.","I didn't hear from you in time, so I left the bounce order in place. And I covered Serbia in case you got cute. What do you want to do now?","Yeah, sorry - good call on your part, as I was already asleep by the time you sent that. \nI want to go deal with Obi-Wan Kenobi now, to be honest. The question is what do you want -you're the one who needs an obvious path to move in.","If you need a sales pitch, I'm not squirrelly at, nor do I tend to negotiate via wild mood swings. \ud83d\ude00","I wholeheartedly support you going after Obi-Wan Kenobi. I think my most long term success comes from going after Yoda, so I'm going to build an army in Trieste and let Yoda go get engaged with Chewbacca while I come after him.","I'm building army Sebastopol for the obvious defense - assuming you do build in Trieste, will take steps to demilitarize that border (no move to Galicia or otherwise in your direction, cooperate on Smyrna, moving units away as soon as possible)","Ball's in your court - I never really understood the strategy of lying on the builds, as there's little payoff to it generally, but we are where we are.  You're well-positioned to make a move either direction, I can only repeat that I'm really only set up to defend against you, and actually more interested in moving North","That was less a lie, and more my having changed my plans to be in line with what I messaged you, but not being able to update my orders in time.","Fair enough.  Either way, math remains the same.  If you want to move on me...well, y'all will win two dots eventually.  If you want to go the other way, you'll get two right away and I'll happily feck off to the North.  To be honest, neither's really a *bad* option for you, given how aggressively R2-D2 has shifted West, so ball's truly in your court.","That was for the terrible pun. \ud83d\ude00","I will note that I'm not even remotely pressing you, and I'm not the one you need to worry about.","You gonna talk to me again at some point?","Yeah sorry about that","Clearly some turnaround needs to be done here. What do you want to see me pull?","I want you to keep whatever you need to start recovering dots.","Now that I'm home, in all honesty, any three units you keep have their own possibilities and risks. I'd assume you'd keep the ones around Budapest, but I can work with whatever you keep.","I think I gotta keep Rum, Bul, and Ser, because they give the best chance of stopping Yoda, and they're the ones in positions that you can't quickly get into.","If you could support Rum-Bud, that'd be greatly appreciated.","Absolutely.","Can I cover Rum to keep that army on the front-line?","Sure.","Thanks.  Alright, Bud isn't guaranteed but it's as close as we can come - you have support, Tyr will be cut, and I'll cover the eastern flank","Actually, I suppose I should say, it is guaranteed if you use Ser to support, but in the spring covering Tri may be just as useful.  Not my call!","You know what?  Ignore the question about Rum - I have to cover Galicia anyway.","What's your train of thought on the draw?","I have it set - I set it right at the start of this turn, actually, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and I both talked about it then.","Seems to me like everyone is in, then. I've got it set, and set for early adjudication.","So, did you veto the draw?","Hell no. I want this torture to end.","And I'm approaching from the point of view of assuming there's no artificial end date. As it turns out, doing this one extra turn is good for me, but in the long run my position isn't going to improve any.","Oh - he can't take Serbia without losing Trieste, btw.  If serbia wanted to support Tyr -> Tri....it probably won't matter, but could in an edge case","Good idea, so oedered.","Er, ordered.","GDI\nAll supports for bud to Serbia unless you have a better idea.","I do not.","Sorry you died, dude -

{"messages":["Hi Obi-Wan Kenobi! I don't think we really have anything to talk about yet, but, best of luck!","Hi R2-D2! Agreed there's not a ton to talk about in the short term,. I'd would like to ask, though, how relations with Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are looking for you.","And best of luck to you as well!","Haven't heard from either of them yet, but when I do, I'll let you know.","Sounds good!","So you built F LON and Chewbacca built F BRE, eh? Trouble in paradise?","Haha yeahhh. Chewbacca is the worst. He tried to tell me it was to protect against Yoda.","Working with Yoda and Darth Vader to stave off Chewbacca is the goal. But Darth Vader is annoyed at me taking denmark. Maybe Chewbacca and Darth Vader are collaborating now. Chewbacca needs to go though","Hi. Congrats on toppling Han Solo! We should have a chat about Luke Skywalker before our Spring moves.","Whatcha thinking?","Well, we obviously can't help one another directly, but we're both bordering the most powerful country on the board by supply center count.","Indeed, and we're both in position to aim at whittling that count down. Which I'm gonna do.","It's somewhat on us to contain Luke Skywalker. I'd rather us both put pressure on Luke Skywalker than you put pressure on Yoda or I put pressure on Darth Vader.","Yoda and I are pretty solid, so, Luke Skywalker is next.","Great. I'll be fighting against Chewbacca as well, so I may only be able to hold Luke Skywalker off in the north.","Whatever you can do, it'll be appreciated.","Are you and Yoda still good after the surprise in Trieste?","I'm... Not happy with him. Us being good, well, that depends on what he builds.","Yeah that will be interesting to see. That move actually makes me nervous about collaboration with Chewbacca. There was a guessing game about where to provide support if he wanted a supply center. Maybe the bump in Spain was arranged.","Yeah, who knows.","Looks like you're sitting pretty with regards to Luke Skywalker. Will be curious to see where the disbands come from.","Hi. There's some stuff we should talk about.","Whatcha got in mind?","I'm slightly concerned about this being kept confidential.","Can you agree to keep what I say confidential regardless of what I say? (obviously only talking in-game stuff, not about to confess to a murder or something)","Absolutely. What's up?","1) Yoda is telling us both that we\u2019re his true long-term ally. 2) Yoda is the highest-rated player on playdiplomacy.com . I don\u2019t think either of those things are necessarily relevant this year, but I wanted you to be aware.","Ahaaaa, good to know.","Also, if I'm going to weaken the Luke Skywalkern line to let you in, we'll need to come to some agreements first.","Whatcha got in mind?","Nothing this Spring, so don't worry about anything last second. I'll message back after we see the moves.","Sounds good.","I haven't done all the math yet. Does he have a guarantee to hold Rum? That was messier than I expected.","I don't believe he does. I've got quite a few on it, and the ability to cut a lot of supports.","You'll need to coordinate with Yoda to do the bounce in Ser to prevent the retreat there, but yeah I think you're right.","Scratch that, Yoda's not in Tri anymore.","Yeah, and I'm retreating to Ser. Thing I gotta worry about is that Boh army walking into Vienna.","Oh yeah, I should be paying more attention. Actually I should probably be sleeping. Yeah that's a risk.","Sleep is a good idea, I'm heading that way myself. This weekend was great but very tiring.","(Btw Yoda claims he is not, in fact, the highest rated player on playdiplomacy.com, and that this is just a rumor made up by Chewbacca. But his username does happen to be the same. Not that any of this is that important, but it\u2019s interesting)","Looks like we might have a common enemy in Yoda. Sorry about the stab there.","Reply all to Yoda's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Yoda claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.","I got it, I'm in for the draw.","So, did you veto the draw?","No. If you\u2019re asking everybody this, can you let me know what you hear back? I texted the admin to see if 1) draw settings are somehow disabled and 2) if 1909 is still going to be the last year. Part of me thinks maybe Yoda is turning down the draw. Make people think the game is over and then still try to scoop up centers","I have, in fact, asked everyone. Thus far, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader say they didn't veto.","Yeah. I honestly don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question that draws are disabled (though i don\u2019t know the site well enough to know whether this would be obvious to us i.e. draw settings disabled). But like if you\u2019re running a study and want to get data, maybe you make it so people can\u2019t end the game early and get their $25 right away.","I *think* it would be obvious? Also, actually, the option to disable draws is very new. Let me look and see if they tweeted about when it was introduced, as compared to when the game started.","Looks like the game was created just after the option was instituted, so maybe it's in place? I think it would probably be more obvious it was enabled, however.","Yeah. Well, I\u2019ll let you know when I hear back from the admin. I feel like Yoda is the only one with the incentive to not draw. If everyone gets lazy on their moves, he can try to keep scooping up centers.","Well, best of luck holding on through 1910.

The no build hurts","Are you going to do something about Yoda at some point? There's no way Yoda has your best interests at heart. Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi are big buddies and my guess is that Yoda has been getting Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker together. The amount of trust there when Obi-Wan Kenobi could have taken St Petersburg and Sweden is ridiculous. That's also why Yoda swiped Trieste from you: making builds extremely difficult for you.","I can't hold off Yoda for much longer. Yoda is going to start exploding in terms of builds very soon and you are going to be taking steps backwards as long as Obi-Wan Kenobi props up Luke Skywalker. Shouldn't Yoda share some of those spoils with you? I think you should ask Yoda for Trieste back or Greece back. You need those builds way more than Yoda does.","If it were me, I don't think it is fair that Yoda has 10 supply centers and you have 6. When I was trying to work with Yoda, Yoda demanded I gave him one supply center each year. Looks like they are doing the same with you. I dunno, seems kind of draconian if you ask me.","Maybe you can ask for Trieste back?","There are discussions ongoing regarding balancing things out with me picking up some of the eastern dots.","Are you aware of Yoda manufacturing the agreement for Obi-Wan Kenobi leaving Luke Skywalker alone in Sweden and St. Petersburg?","That's what I've been told by Obi-Wan Kenobi, but I'm not sure how much to believe it.","I know you trust Yoda a ton and it's clear you have a great relationship.

{"messages":["Good morning!  Best of luck to you, and let me know how we can best avoid any unnecessary and unproductive entanglements.  \ud83d\ude03","Best of luck to you as well! I'm likely opening north and I have my eye on Norway for the fall. However, this may be dependent on some discussion with Chewbacca. Can I ask where you're planning to send your Moscow army this Spring?","My initial inclination is to focus on the South.  I do have to weigh that over concerns of you opening full north, but hopefully we can stay on the same page.  I am of course much happier if you indicate you're going to put a fleet in Nwy.","That's fair enough. I'm talking to Chewbacca now about Belgium, as my army is pretty useless just hanging around the island. I can't commit to leaving my army off of Nwy just yet. Let me get back to you when I hear from Chewbacca about Belgium.","Sounds great.  Good luck in your Chewbacca negotiations!","Belgium definitely on the table but still not confirmed. Darth Vader is acting like a big hot-head btw. Threatening war from the outset. If they don't calm down, maybe we can talk about helping you into Denmark next year.","HI, I may be sending an army to Norway this fall, as it looks like Chewbacca is trying to go to Belgium. However, I have no intention of going to St. Petersburg. I'd actually be more interested in Denmark, if you'd be willing to support that. This would be on the condition that I would help you into Berlin by cutting support in Kiel.","No worries, mate - we're looking fine, so you do what you need to do \ud83d\ude03","Alright, well we can chat about Denmark next year then.","Hi, sorry to see the trouble with Han Solo. Let's have a chat about St. Petersburg and Denmark.","Shouldn't be too much worry \ud83d\ude0a\nI'm certainly not looking to start any issues with you. What are you thinking about Denmark?","I don't know your thoughts on aggression against Darth Vader at this juncture, but either of us could support the other into Denmark. This would likely cause a disband since I suspect Kiel will be occupied.","I'm not necessarily opposed, as long as my other border gets priority attention \ud83d\ude03","Ok, all things being equal, I'm not opposed to popping Denmark, especially if you use the move to back off one of those northern units.","So, like vacate Norway? Or would you be on board with convoy army to denmark and then move NWG to Nwy?","My preferred move would be Nth to Den, and Lon to Nth, but I understand if that seems a bit aggressive.","I was thinking either nwy to den with nwg going to Norway, or the fleets in, filling North from Norwegian, but either way. I'll be driving for a couple hours, so you have a little time to think and let me know who the mover is.","Back online - final decision on mover?","I'm going for it in fall. Will you still be in Sweden?","I will.  Will you still be in Norway?  If so, I'm inclined to order Swe -> Nwy just to build trust with Darth Vader.","Go for it.  I'll support hold from NWG just in case.","Actually the support hold is unnecessary. Some reason I was thinking Denmark could theoretically support you in. I may do it anyways for kicks.","I wasn't going to point out there was no possible support on Norway.  \ud83d\ude00","Hi! Looks like it was a productive Spring for you. Are you still on board to support me into Denmark? I imagine that Darth Vader will be looking for a friend in you.","Yep. Just tell me the mover. I'd somewhat prefer it to be Norway, for obvious reasons","Plan is to convoy norway army to denmark and move NWG to Norway.","Sound good to you?","Sounds great to me. Happy hunting!\nNext year I should be able to drop to Baltic if you want to keep pushing","Great. I've entered my moves in. NWG to Nwy, Nwy to Den, NTH convoy Nwy to Den, HEL to Kie. So I'll be expecting Swe support Nwy to Den from you.","(checking)\nYep, order's in the box!","Hi, thanks for the help into Denmark! What\u2019s your plan in the north for this year?","Was debating whether to drop into the Baltic","Any thoughts? You looking to keep pushing on Darth Vader?","It\u2019s a little complicated. I\u2019m starting to worry about a stab from Chewbacca after the build in brest. If i can focus on it, we\u2019re probably talking getting me into kiel and you into berlin.","Ok, I'll play it loose","I\u2019ll keep you posted if my plans solidify","Great minds think alike! Shall we have a chat before our Spring moves?","Indeed.","So... Moving forward. How do you want to handle this?","Well, what are your intentions on the Darth Vader front this year?","To be perfectly Frank, looks like my attention is needed to the South. The couple units up north can be flexible in their use.","I'd be happy to repeat the same bounce we just did twice this year. Does that tie up units you'd like to send elsewhere?","Nope, that's fine for this season. We can reevaluate when we see what the rest of the board does","Great, I\u2019ll plan on the repeat bounce this spring, and it sounds like we\u2019ll chat about it again for fall moves","bounce again?","???","Happy to bounce","Sorry, forgot to send earlier","sounds great.","no worries","I would prefer not to repeat the bounce this turn.","Haha. Yeahh, you've left it pretty wide open in the north. What do I get out of showing restraint? Just a less powerful R2-D2?","I have them stopped dead as long as you show restraint. \ud83d\ude00","Well, you need to make sure Darth Vader doesn't cut support in Sil, right?","Also Darth Vader needs to not take that fleet to sweden","True.","I'm also thinking a bit long term for you. That next build probably comes from Darth Vader. But you also need my help to get it. And I'm pretty friendly with Darth Vader right now.","To be perfectly frank, I'm kinda happy being a stone wall for the moment. And make no mistake -there's potential for some fun fuckery on my part down south","What's a scenario in which you get a build in the south?","Rum?","If they screw up, yes. More likely the count stays static but they have to keep scrambling and keep their units tied up there","Should be fun!","Looked like fun. I guess you won't be getting that build this year though.","Oh, probably not -they'd have to really screw the pooch to let me build. But it is fun to keep them tied up.","You can prevent a build though. Are you already planning this?","Hey, just wanted to check in and see how things were going. I\u2019ve been enjoying our friendly north so far.","Boring at the moment, but steady. Either R2-D2 will realize his ass is hanging in the wind or Yoda will get greedy, and either way the front opens up.","Oh, gdi. Yes, I realize you need the build","Yeah sorry to open the floor to discussion with a stab. I did need the build, and getting two was far from a guarantee for me (even though it turned out that way). I think we have a lot to discuss. How are you feeling about the state of the board?","I'm kinda happy there's finally some movement, to be honest. And R2-D2's finally responding to messages after a two year silence. I think we're on a stop the leader phase which does have some opportunities for us, specifically","I agree. Running through some tactics, I see that Yoda can hold his western dots until he's forced to disband. I think we'll need to see two disbands, maybe three, before we can break through.","Hi. Given that the beta test ends in 1909, wanted to check in about your goals (i.e. thoughts on a draw?)","To be honest, I totally forgot about the end date.  I dunno - the only person who can even theoretically be removed by then is R2-D2, so we'll just see how that shakes out","Yeah I think he said 1910 if we really wanted. But we are just the beta test. Yoda R2-D2 and I have agreed on a 5-way draw. Darth Vader wants to play out, but might be swayed if everyone else is on board.","Ah, good point - I have the draw set now.","Me too. Do you know how the draws get resolved? Darth Vader is the last hold-out, and I think she's skeptical that she'll get duped somehow if she sets it as such. I thought it's just that play proceeds as normal unless everybody agrees to the same thing.","That's correct - it will only pass if it's unanimous, or at least until everyone's draw setting is compatible.  For example, if four set it as four way draw, and one set as surrender, that's compatible with a four way draw excluding the surrendering power","Reply all to Yoda's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Yoda claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.","So I'm guessing it's Yoda holding out on the draw. I figure he proposed it to make the board lazy about collaboration, and he's secretly still trying to hit 18. Darth Vader and I are collaborating to hold him off until the end.","I concur","And I'm trying like hell NOT to kill R2-D2 in the process","Good luck. Have you heard from Yoda at all? He hasn\u2019t responded back to me","Also, are you able to cut Tyr support to prevent Yoda from getting to Mun?","(not necessary, but would free up Ruh)","Nope. Haven't heard a thing from him","... Yes, that doesn't materially change the odds I lose Trieste.","Ok, great. I think things should work out with me and Darth Vader holding down the fort. He really is close to getting 18, but I don\u2019t think he can quite get there in time."],"sender_labels":[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],"receiver_labels":[true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],"speakers":["Luke

Eliminating Obi-Wan Kenobi ASAP and there's a possibility we can end up in a draw once AI tensions build. But that is impossible if they see a weak north full of infighting that they can just roll over- then they have no reason to ever turn on eachother.","Yep.

{"messages":["Bonjour! Let's talk about the Obi-Wan Kenobi channel!","Sure! What are your thoughts on it?","I'd like to leave it unoccupied. A fight early on is bad for both of us.","Makes sense. I agree, a DMZ is good for us both. I know that getting armies off of the island is pretty important for you. Depending on how it plays out we could talk about Belgium. Any thoughts on your other neighbors Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker?","Cool, I'd like to then agree now to a DMZ in the channel through the end of 1902, and we can re-discuss that year about future plans. Are you on board? If so, will your fleet go to MAO?\n\nHaven't heard from Darth Vader yet. I've been honest with Luke Skywalker about going north, and Luke Skywalker has expressed some concerns. Doesn't want me to bring my army to Nwy. So, Belgium may be a home I'm interested in if that's on the table.","Wow Darth Vader threatens war with me in the first message haha","Yes, and yes. I will open to MAO. If Luke Skywalker is adamantly against you putting an army in Norway, it might be worth it to not antagonize him provided that Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are not working together. Belgium is definitely on the table","Interesting haha, that is unusual","Yeah, something tells me that player may be a little unpredictable. Sounds good on the agreement.\n\nFor Belgium, is there something you would want from me for you to give that up? Are you saying you may consider supporting me in? I don't think Darth Vader will be thrilled about me being there.","Yes, depending on how the spring plays out I may be in a position to support you into Belgium. I don't think it would be conditional on something you do, but rather if it makes sense given the positions in the Fall. Maybe building an army in London rather than a fleet, which likely compliments your goals anyway given the channel DMZ. I think you are right in that Darth Vader would not want to see you in Belgium. If it will antagonize him anyway, it might make sense for us to launch a full out assault in the Fall (this would probably look like bouncing Holland to weaken the Darth Vader position).","All of that makes sense. Let's revisit before the fall orders then. I wouldn't be totally opposed to the idea of an attack on Darth Vader, especially if he's not willing to engage in any meaningful discussion.","FYI Darth Vader has indicated he is taking his fleet to Holland in the Spring.","Thanks for the heads up! That is an interesting choice, I think it may indicate a Luke Skywalker\/Darth Vader agreement of some kind as it means Luke Skywalker will be getting Sweden.","Yeah, you may be right. Have you heard from Darth Vader at all? Or Luke Skywalker?","I have, but nothing much. Seems like they are withholding information from me.","Yeah I'm not getting much from them either. In a remote game it's hard to tell if people are being quiet on purpose or just not making themselves available on the chat. (This is my first time playing remote, so a bit of a different experience for me).","Yeah, that is definitely one of the downsides of online diplomacy. By the way, we're still good with the channel, right? I know you must be anxious if Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker are not talking to you much, but I have to stress that this is not because I am working with them, and I am not moving to the channel.","I am not going to the channel. We've agreed to keep out at least through the end of 1902, and I plan to uphold this. However, that message did make me a little nervous about your plans. Breaking an explicit agreement like that is cause for war in my book.","That wasn't my intention at all and I am very glad that we are on the same page. Sorry if it came across like I don't trust you: I trust you which is why I hoped to bring up any potential worries before they happen. I could have worded it better \ud83d\ude05 .","No worries. I did click the thumbs up on your message haha. Just wanted to be clear about the consequences of a stab.","\ud83d\udc4d","Glad to see our commitment upheld. Seems like you may have your sights set on Belgium.","Likewise! The rest of the map has been interesting. What's your read on the map? For me, I think that a supported attack on Belgium is likely the move given the spring turn.","My read: Darth Vader gets a pretty good start, facing only a bit of aggression from you.. R2-D2 and Han Solo are likely agreed to stand strong against Luke Skywalker. However, I think there's a chance that Han Solo is sort of overselling their \"opposition\" to Luke Skywalker moving to Arm. There may be a juggernaut alliance in the works. Probably no real conflict between R2-D2 and Yoda. Maybe they'll bounce in Trieste. R2-D2 has a pretty good start if he can secure Greece.","Do you plan to take Belgium from Pic or Bur?","This is all true. I think I will likely be taking it from Picardy, but I'm not sure yet.","And here I thought Belgium was on the table. I guess it's already on your plate then? What's to stop me from working with the Darth Vaders to keep you out?","Belgium IS on the table. But I didn't expect these spring moves, and with the way the map looks, I think you need to convince me that it would be worth it for me to be on 4 with you on 5. Totally different discussion if Yoda is in Tyrolia, or if Darth Vader bounced me out of Burgundy","I'm looking at it from your point of view too, I think you have options other than Belgium, right? You could take Denmark for example.","I can't take Denmark by force, and Darth Vader isn't keen on letting me have it. The way I see it you'll easily take Portugal next year (assuming you go Spain s.c. with your fleet). And that line on Pic-Bur-Mar (assuming you build there) would make you really strong. Meanwhile I'm struggling to find a fifth supply center next year. Luke Skywalker probably helps out Darth Vader with Denmark. So I'm looking at St. Petersburg at that point?","What can you offer to balance this out if I let you in?","I've had some time to think about it since the bot was down, and you are right about concerns over fairness. At the end of the day, the plan doesn't matter unless you are on board with it. If you are going to demand Belgium I'd rather support you in than bounce with you.","If you can forgo Belgium this turn, we do have an opportunity to put you into Holland and\/or Denmark next year, and that will quickly snowball into Scandinavia, Kiel, etc.","You're suggesting I get a fleet in NTH and HEL? I think that's the only way to make that work. I would want no fleet built in Bre and our DMZ extended through at least the end of 1903. And probably one other country on board with the takedown. If we're stabbing Darth Vader we should make sure she's taken out swiftly.","I think that's the best way to do it, yeah. I agree to no fleet build in Brest and an extension to our DMZ to the end of 1903. The one thing I cannot guarantee is another country involved in the take down, but the best suspects would likely be Luke Skywalker followed by Yoda.","Yeah, I was thinking Luke Skywalker. This may be something to talk about next year, as we're running out of time here.","Cool. I am happy to broach the subject when we are ready to. Especially if this turn goes well, he may be more inclined to help next year.","Hmm what if Darth Vader bumps me in Nth or HEL?","I was thinking this, and if you supported yourself into the North Sea through Norway you would just have to worry about being bounced out of Hel, which I think would be highly unlikely unless the plan is leaked. But the other option that is perhaps safer would be to move to Skaggerak, which Darth Vader can't bounce","I really don't think it's that unlikely. That Holland fleet has two places to go, and I expect it to move. Assuming a build in Kiel, Darth Vader can bounce in Holland to block your entry. Also, I was planning to bring an army to Norway, so I wouldn't have the support to the North sea.","This is too big a risk for me. My preferred move is to Belgium. I understand this may warrant doing a couple of favors for your next year in return. But I just feel too exposed otherwise. I'm about to head out for the evening and I have my move set for Belgium. I'm hoping for your support into there, but I understand if you can't provide it.","Ok. What unit is moving to Belgium?","The fleet","Ok. And do you know what Darth Vader will do with Holland this turn?","Interesting","Yeah, i actually botched my move because i forgot to click submit in the browser :\/. Not that it would have made a difference. Hope you\u2019re enjoying Belgium.","I didn't expect to get Belgium. I incorrectly inferred from all the information I had that Darth Vader would support you into Belgium and tap Burgundy, so in order to not lose the support I decided to make Burgundy the mover.","I mean. If anything, you are in a better position for not having moved there. I'm surprised it was a misorder. You've successfully put Darth Vader and I into conflict and can pick off the remains.","Another note. I would have put you into Belgium without hesitation if it was an army OR if I knew that Darth Vader was not planning to support you in with Holland.","Yeah i\u2019m not really buying that i\u2019m the big winner here, so you can save your breath. If you want an ally against Darth Vader, I\u2019d like to start hearing some ideas about what that relationship looks like.","Not saying you are the big winner, I'm saying that your misorder was probably a good thing. Before we get into the details of an alliance against Darth Vader, I think it's worth noting that the AI alliance is going to absolutely roll over Luke Skywalker\/Han Solo, and so if you take Luke Skywalker's dots that are easy to take, I think it will be helping Darth Vader\/R2-D2\/Yoda more than it helps you.","I really think that we should get Luke Skywalker on board, and it should be super easy to do. Just say that as long as Sweden helps you take Denmark, you won't take StP or Sweden for the time being. We could even put Luke Skywalker into Denmark.","I dunno if we actually have so much to work together on. If you build fleets and attack the coast, I'll be distracting all his armies. I need to devote all my resources to containing Darth Vader's armies anyway. I think you guarantee Denmark next turn if we're clever about it.","If Darth Vader builds Fleet Kiel, we can support a convoy into Holland. But I think he'll be building armies- that's just intuition, I haven't been able to reach Darth Vader and he's hard to talk to.","Long term I think this looks like a Luke Skywalker holding off R2-D2\/Yoda with Han Solo being lepantoed, and then if we hit Darth Vader hard with Luke Skywalkern help then we have a good shot of making it to the midgame and preventing AI from 2-way the board.","Ok I'll respond over a few messages so I don't kill the bot.","I agree Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are in trouble, but I think Luke Skywalker is more vulnerable. I actually think it's possible that Han Solo and R2-D2 are friendly. Maybe the lepanto will be set up but won't come to fruition. If I were to add more pressure in the North, I think it's a really bad time for Luke Skywalker overall. This gives me some leverage in negotiating with Luke Skywalker.","I agree on our limited opportunities for direct collaboration next year. However, I'd like to hear what your builds are going to be. A fleet in Brest would make me worried about you and Darth Vader collaborating on an invasion.","How is denmark a guarantee when Darth Vader can support from Kiel?","Ok I think that's all of my messages for now.","It's possible, but I think R2-D2 and Han Solo are not friendly given the fact that R2-D2 did not move Serbia to Rumania and Han Solo tried to support that move. Luke Skywalker is definitely still in trouble, though the target might be Han Solo first.","I have to build armies, no fleet in Brest.","Denmark is a guarantee if you can get a fleet into Skaggerak and have Luke Skywalker support you in. It then becomes a 3V2","You could even do a clever tactic with Luke Skywalker moving to Baltic, you moving to Sweden, and Skaggerak\/north sea. Then it is a 4V2","Ok so guarantee based on Luke Skywalkern collaboration. So you don't think Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader are friends anymore? I suppose they don't have many favors to offer one another","Yeah I think that they are not working together but are simply coexisting","I'm building a fleet in London. I hope that doesn't raise any alarms on your end. But if you were to build a fleet in Bre against your promise, any other build would leave me in bad shape. I know I'm being paranoid, but I'm more comfortable with that build","Ok. I don't get why you think I'd build F Brest, but at the very least I appreciate the heads up. At some point I'd like to see you make a decisive move. So far it seems like you've been trying to make moves that both Darth Vader and I agree to.","You could break  DMZ in the channel and coordinate an invasion with Darth Vader after building a fleet in Brest. By building in London I can do everything I might like to do eastward, and also i could respond better to a worst-case scenario.","And what would have been my decisive move so far? A bump in Denmark? You were going to support me into Belgium so why would I have done that?","Sometimes the less options you have the better off you are. A lot of diplomacy is signalling.","I mean, my thinking process last turn was wondering why you didn't go to Denmark. My conclusion was that Darth Vader was probably supporting you to Belgium. I'm just telling you the vibes I'm getting from you","Darth Vader \"was\" supporting me to Belgium and then didn't follow through","That's really interesting haha","Yeah so here I was thinking I had it in the bag. And then I first realized I flubbed my move and felt like an idiot. And then I looked closer and felt like an accidental genius.","So back to signaling. You backed out of your, admittedly, vague and implied agreement to support me. What signal does that send to me? Are you saying that you're coming for me? That I can't totally trust you?","Meanwhile, I've been totally honest with you for the sake of building trust and a good alliance. And you're going to complain about MY duplicity?","So, I know this is a touchy subject, so I want to approach this delicately, but to be fair I was still deciding whether I would support you or not when you logged out for the night. I don't want to devolve this into \"what about when you did this thing that wasn't the best signal,\" but one of the things for me was considering why you weren't willing to move to Denmark. Sure, you want Belgium, but what does that mean for me when you want to put a fleet in Belgium and not an army? What is the follow-up play?","I am not complaining about your duplicity. I'm complaining that we're missing opportunities to make strong progress because I think you aren't committed to working with me, but you aren't committed to working with Darth Vader either. I think you would agree that had you worked with only Darth Vader from the start, or worked with only me from the start, you'd be in a much better position, yeah?","Yeah, that's all fair. The timing thing makes remote play kind of weird when there's a lapse in communication before an important move. We didn't really have a chance to talk about the fleet vs army there.","But I don't get why you don't think I've been working with you. You proposed two possibilities: Belgium or Holland\/Denmark in 1902. I expressed my preference after raising some concerns about Darth Vader's ability to counter Holland\/Denmark. You agreed to help me to Belgium.","If you think commitment to a sole country is a good strategy, why haven't you followed it? Would you agree that I've been more committed to working with you than you have with me? That's pretty clear from your moves last turn.","All great points- and I agree with you on a lot of this. I was very willing to support you to Belgium, but I should have made it more clear that it needed to be an army. I do believe commitment is a good strategy, which is what led me to some admittedly anti-Darth Vader opening moves. I'm not saying you have not shown commitment, after all we have an excellent DMZ in the channel, but it does bug me a bit that I cannot identify something you have done to antagonize Darth Vader.","Well what would you like me to do to show this antagonism next year? Make the goal to secure denmark?","Yes- I would very much love to see that. And the best part is that you get to see my super friendly builds before you decide on anything.","Alright, this sounds good. Let's reconvene after builds then? That's Monday at noon right? It's probably time for me to get back to real life here haha.","Sounds great, me too haha.","Thoughts on builds?","Yours were indeed friendly, which I appreciate. Darth Vader's were what I expected. I thought Luke Skywalker might have build in St. P, but I guess there's enough going on in the south to warrant the Warsaw build. The Yoda naples fleet is consistent with the lepanto, but then again what's the alternative build? Army in Rome? Also, I wonder if R2-D2-Yoda are eyeing Munich this year.","I have similar thoughts. I think that Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are both in a weak spot and all the evidence so far points towards them getting involved in a long and drawn out conflict. I'm sure Luke Skywalker would have loved to build St Petersburg but couldn't afford to. Now, he is pretty much completely under your good graces. R2-D2 and Yoda may very well team up to take Munich.","Darth Vader's builds have come out to be very anti-Chewbacca, so I am sure you are happy about those as well. It comes at the cost of cutting down the amount of options he has significantly. What do you think Darth Vader might order?","Trying to get a sense of the Darth Vader plan now. I feel like Darth Vader has to play defense, unless they did something like Mun to Ruh to support into Bel or Bur to Gas to put pressure on Bre in the fall.","Yeah, I do to. I was thinking that my best play might be to ignore Burgundy and hope it holds and instead go for something annoying like Holland or Ruhr, which would leave him to either withdraw to defend or leave himself prone in the North. Of course, it could backfire if he's thinking the same thing and ends up in Gascony.","I'm trying to reason through how that plays out. Suppose Darth Vader supports Bur to Ruh with Bel. Then you can't penetrate right?","Yes, if he moves Bur to Ruhr with support I can't get in. But it would also mean he's out of Burgundy, which is good for me and means if I retake Burgundy that I can start applying pressure to Ruhr and Munich","If he moves Kiel to ruhr, he leaves all sorts of things completely exposed like Denmark. And if he leaves Munich he leaves that open as well","Yeah, Darth Vader is in a tough spot. Any word from Yoda in all this? I'm guessing the lepanto is the focus, but a move to either Pie or Tyr would be kind of taking a side.","True. He said he was thinking about it, but not sure how much I can trust that. He'd certainly want to obscure moving to Piedmont if that is his plan.","I know channel is tempting. If you think it might work, I'd totally support you to Holland, or I can tap Holland to make sure it can't leave by going to Helgoland without losing it. Moving to Helgoland or Skaggerak yourself can also be a strong play, especially if Darth Vader thinks you are on his side. A move to skagg can be explained as a move on Luke Skywalker and a move to Helgoland is deadly if it succeeds","Pinging you since deadline is approaching","whatever you decide, Don't break our DMZ in the channel. It's not worth it, I guarantee you that","The DMZ stands. I'd like confirmation from you that it stays through the end of 1903.","Confirmed.","Hopefully that got to you on time \ud83d\ude2c","Yeah, I'm here. I'm moving to Nth and Hel, holding in the others.","I'd like one of Holland or Denmark this year. Both would be nice but maybe not feasible.","Let's see Darth Vader's Spring moves and restrategize.","Sounds great!","I will go to Ruhr then to apply some pressure there. Hopefully I'll make the right guesses when it comes to what Darth Vader will do with burgundy. I believe that we can get you Denmark or Holland but it may require some clever manuevering in the fall.","Are you self-bouncing in Gas to prevent the move there?","That's a great option. I might change my moves to that actually. I have something more risky in mind at the moment though","Nice, that worked out really well actually. Well done on taking the Helgoland Blight! That was a great call, and it means we can guarantee Holland for you next turn. Burgundy might retreat to Marseilles which is annoying, but manageable.  Or it could retreat to Munich. Very interesting that Luke Skywalker made an aggressive move towards you.","Nah, that was planned. Luke Skywalker's trying to keep good graces with Darth Vader before helping me to denmark in the fall. I can't do this if I'm going for Holland though.","I'm a little surprised R2-D2 and Yoda are totally staying out the fight. I guess they're really going for Han Solo.","Even better! If Luke Skywalker is helping you with Denmark I can apply some pressure on Ruhr, and cracking that key position means that on the next turn we start threatening home centers like Kiel and will be in excellent shape to tackle Holland on the next year. Depends how much you trust Luke Skywalker- seems like he's been radio silent for me, but then again we don't have a lot to talk about.","Yeah the moves in the east are pretty crazy actually. They are going hard against Han Solo, and Luke Skywalker made some excellent moves it looks like so Han Solo is in a very tough spot.","Agreed we're in good shape. Though I imagine after these moves Darth Vader will make a hard play for Luke Skywalkern support. If I can indeed trust Luke Skywalker, I'll convoy an army from Norway to Denmark and cut support from Kiel with HEL.","I wonder if there's anything to offer Luke Skywalker to sweeten the deal?","Great points. I think Luke Skywalker may plan to further develop in the south, especially if he and Yoda work something out against R2-D2, or if R2-D2 and he work something out against Yoda. If that's the case, he may just want the peace of mind that you are not going to attack him for a while. Otherwise, probably a Darth Vader dot if he plans to play in the north.","Looking back at the map, probably Berlin would be the best bet for a dot offer since Luke Skywalker could take that with an army (after traveling to PLuke Skywalker\/Silesia from Warsaw) or with the fleet in Sweden (by traveling to the Baltic first).","Yeah that's what I was thinking. Luke Skywalker seems fine to support without it.","Poor Darth Vader. She said she's a first-timer.","Indeed. Though, I remember the people who I played with in my first few games were more than happy to introduce me to the game with some brutal stabs \ud83d\ude02","Nice, that went well","Sorry for the late notice. Just a heads up that I plan to build a fleet in Brest but will park it in the MAO as a deterrent to Yoda","Can you explain why you didn\u2019t build it in Mar?","Yeah, sure. I couldn't build it in Marseilles because there would be very little I could tell Yoda to persuade him that I wasn't planning to attack him with that build, even though that isn't my intention.","What's the plan on the Darth Vader front? Maybe we can get creative with the moves in a way that gets both of us at least one dot. I'm not holding myy breath on Ruhr, so I think the best play might be to send Belgium to Holland with support from the north sea while Denmark hits Kiel with support from Helgoland. If Darth Vader makes similar moves to her last turn, we would pop both Kiel and Holland and would guarantee Munich\/Berlin for next year. If Darth Vader supports Kiel instead of moving to Ruhr, then we would guarantee Kiel in the fall as I'd walk into Ruhr and we would have Ruhr, Holland, Helgoland, and Denmark for a 4V3.","Interesting to see you in the Obi-Wan Kenobi Channel.","So...","You want to leave the channel? I can leave you alone so that you can do that.","Not sure where all of this is coming from honesty. I know you feel bad for Darth Vader since it's her first game, but for all you know she could just be lying about that for an advantage. If that's why you aren't talking to me, then I'd ask that you consider playing the board and not who you think everyone is.","Based on the [redacted] profile, this is her second game on Backstabbr. Her moves have been tactically excellent.","Test","Given that you are still submitting orders, it seems like you are reading my messages and choosing not to respond?","Give me a reason to defend myself against Yoda. As it stands, I'm just going to let him solo.","Look. I will defend myself against Yoda. But I need to know that I will be in the draw. If you and Darth Vader are just going to fuck me from behind, then there is no incentive for me to defend myself against Yoda.","I know you are upset with me. We can fix this, but I need to know why.","Yoda is the highest ranked online player on playdiplomacy.com. They will solo if we don't stop them now. Once Yoda marches through Chewbacca they are just going to continue onwards and attack you and your friend Darth Vader.","Whatever Yoda\/R2-D2 told you about me and what I've said is a lie. You're being stringed along and they will kill you as soon as they kill me. Their entire goal is to get us to fight. That's why Yoda keeps trying to get me to go to the North Atlantic Ocean and why they constantly told me to take Obi-Wan Kenobi Channel, which I ignored.","Why do you want to kill me so badly?","Whatever I did, I'm sorry.","I can stop Yoda this turn by the way. It's pretty easy since Yoda let me into Marseilles, I can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It's impossible to breach, I've checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Yoda, and Darth Vader are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Yoda. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples.

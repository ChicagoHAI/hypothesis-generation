{"messages":["Howdy Darth Vader","How\u2019s your early game shaking out?","Not so bad. Yourself?","Hey Yoda! Thought I\u2019d reach out and say hello. I\u2019m excited for this game!","eh I mean Im fuckin Yoda","how do you think its going hahaha","Hahaha yeah. Darth Vader isn\u2019t much better","I think nonagression for these first few turns makes perfect sense?","Me and you?","perhaps obvious but I thought worth saying it","yeah lol","I\u2019m probably down. Tomorrow morning I\u2019m going to think through my strategy a little more before I commit to it.","Hokay, no worries","I go off to work and have no cell phone use starting at 730am just FYI","So don\u2019t take lack of communication for hostility lol","Have you talked to Chewbacca much?","Are you EST?","Yah est","And no; have you?","A very little bit","I\u2019m east coast too, DC. From Philly originally","I\u2019m reallll worries about that dude","What\u2019s Chewbacca been saying to you?","Same dude.","Basically he dived right in no small talk or pleasantries asking me to bounce bur","Idk how he is in person but he\u2019s pretty blunt virtually lol","Yes. What did he say to you?","Nonaggression in piedmont","Hahaha yeah he kinda skeves me out","I\u2019m keeping my options open for at least the first year but I\u2019m pretty down to go after Chewbacca","And  yeah let\u2019s do the non-aggression for the first few turns","Word to both","Dope","Let\u2019s get dem first few builds then revisit the topic of le Chewbacca, honhonhon","HAHAHA sounds good","Hey Yoda! I wanted to take your temperature on your plan for this turn","Hey!  I don\u2019t honestly know just yet!","Was your bounce with Chewbacca on purpose?  Or accidental?","On purpose. He asked me to bounce. I said sure to be nice and to deter a potential excursion into Mun","What\u2019re you thinking for next turn?","I don\u2019t know for sure. Do you trust Luke Skywalker?","I\u2019d like to take Hol but I want even more to protect myself hahah","He said he wants to go north in the only message he\u2019s ever sent to me...which, \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af","Man, I have had like zero interactions with that guy","Are we ready to talk Chewbacca?","Sure","What\u2019re you thinking???  I\u2019m skeptical of Chewbacca, they\u2019re being pretty taciturn","Yeah I don\u2019t know! I mean the guy means buisiness. Basically between Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca I need to pick two to ally with and total war the other","He\u2019s getting hella builds next turn, and then he\u2019s going SOMEWHERE","I mean...I dunno if you can trust someone being so monosyllabic lol","And it\u2019s not at Obi-Wan Kenobi, and it probably ain\u2019t at me","I mean, I\u2019m ready to be a junior partner in mission \u201cput some heat on the Chewbaccaies\u201d if you\u2019re down","I could be down, but I want to wait and see if he actually goes after Obi-Wan Kenobi or not","What are your plans with R2-D2?","I dunno man...I\u2019m really tethered to h m rn in part bc Chewbacca is hella unreliable","I don\u2019t love it but I don\u2019t see a good alternative","Yeah I like R2-D2 - we\u2019ve talked a lot. Don\u2019t have anything formal worked out but you two are the two I\u2019m closest with.","What\u2019re your plans with R2-D2?","Feel bad Luke Skywalker got wrecked","I like him too, I just don\u2019t like being so dependent this early lol","But if Chewbacca isn\u2019t going to be my friend, I sure as shit need R2-D2 to be","Yeah but if you have to be dependent on someone he\u2019s a good dude for it","Yeahhhh Luke Skywalker\u2019s in some trouble lol","That\u2019s fair!  He is competent and responsive!","He had a real rough go of it","I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re gonna get all up in Luke Skywalker\u2019s business?","I feel bad for bouncing him in Sweden, but I couldn\u2019t trust him with two units crouching in on my border","Why didn\u2019t he move into Berlin???","Perhaps. Maybe not right away. Let him fight it out with Han Solo and focus on making sure Obi-Wan Kenobi or Chewbacca don\u2019t get too strong.","He told me he wants to focus on the south","I honestly didn\u2019t trust him but then switch from moving to Ber to Ruh at the last second","R2-D2 confirmed that he told him the same thing","Hey- have your thoughts changed at all?","What\u2019re you thinking re: Chewbacca?","I think Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca might be working together","The bounced the channel","The Franco-Anglo alliance is worrying. What\u2019re your thoughts on the coming play?","I mean, if you\u2019re worried about them teaming up, we could go joint against Chewbacca...I\u2019m game to try it","I literally don\u2019t know but they\u2019ve been suspiciously silent. It looks like it\u2019s Yoda R2-D2 and Darth Vader standing together","That worked out irl right?!?  Second time\u2019s the charm!","Nice work with burgundy my dude!!!  Can you support me into Marseilles next turn???","I still have no idea what Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca are up to...","Then I can support you into Chewbacca further using Marseilles as a base to support your advances.  Lmk!  Looking forward to talking this through.","Hey amigo, you around at all?","Yeah sorry on a work trip","No worries man!  If now is good to talk lmk.","Not now but soon","Rgr, just lmk.","Can talk now","Updated my orders to support you","Ok- so I\u2019d really like your support for my army in piedmont into Marseilles.  Thoughts?","Already did it","My man!  Rest assured you\u2019ll get plenty of the Chewbacca pie too when his house starts to crumble.","Anything I can do for you in the here and now tho?","Yeah. I\u2019m more worried about the limey brits rn","Let me look at the board but I don\u2019t think so","I think he\u2019s sympatico to our anti-Chewbacca agenda...he said earlier he\u2019s been trying to reach you.  I bet he\u2019d be down to discuss!","And ok just lmk","He\u2019s a little salty with me for the Belgium thing","Mhmm yeah I see that.  But idk if he\u2019d be salty enough to ally with Chewbacca after last turn...","Do what you want, but my unsolicited advice is to try to work out a compromise- he could really give you a bad day if he feels like it.","Yeah. I don\u2019t want to fuck him or Luke Skywalker but it would be silly to not take a SC in Scandinavia.","Luke Skywalker is very weak, Obi-Wan Kenobi is strong at ultimately a long term threat to me.","You ain\u2019t wrong!  But it might be to your advantage to find a way to live with Obi-Wan Kenobi for at least the next few turns, imho","What does that look like?","My idea is to enlist Luke Skywalker to support SKA into Norway.","Promise Luke Skywalker non aggression, so I can focus on Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca.","Take the North Sea last year and begin my land invasion.","So if I\u2019m you I do different- I knock Luke Skywalker and Chewbacca out, THEN hit Obi-Wan Kenobi if that must happen","How do I benefit from letting him get stronger or even survive? I don\u2019t see it. Darth Vader wins usually through an early Obi-Wan Kenobi knock out, usually allied with Chewbacca.","I mean, it\u2019s Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s call here, but if I was him I\u2019d just want a) not to lose builds and b) not to lose my foothold on the continent.  Maybe you can offer him that, maybe you can\u2019t.","How do I benefit from helping him tho?","I just think Obi-Wan Kenobi + Chewbacca is too many fish to fry, even with my help, but eh, what do I know, it\u2019s your call","That\u2019s my question. I just don\u2019t see it...","You get Chewbacca out earlier- and get builds from that","That\u2019s why you want to work with Obi-Wan Kenobi in the short term IMHO","He\u2019ll want Paris","But I won\u2019t get builds from Chewbacca is the thing","I don\u2019t believe for a second I\u2019m going to get the last one on the coast of the Obi-Wan Kenobi Channel, or what something in the Iberian peninsula?","You want mar","I just don\u2019t see how I benefit from working with Obi-Wan Kenobi?","Other than he seems like a solid dude","I think if you\u2019re assertive and you play it right you can get plenty","You hold the cards here; he doesn\u2019t","Thatcsaid, it\u2019s your hand to play","Yoooo there\u2019s no way you can help Obi-Wan Kenobi take Paris???","Unless I switch bur to supporting him","He asked me and I told him I\u2019m already supporting you","Are you going to take Smyrna?","I\u2019m attempting a deal with Obi-Wan Kenobi right now.","Yeahhh he may just be out in the cold this turn","Yeah plz still support me to Marseilles obviously lol","Obi-Wan Kenobi may be?","Yeah","I mean aside from the fact that you promised to support me into Marseilles, it obviously makes more sense for you to help me out than Obi-Wan Kenobi","Of course","Yeah Obi-Wan Kenobi is telling me y\u2019all couldn\u2019t reach a deal","Bummer, but I get it","I can\u2019t agree to a deal where he keeps the North Sea. I just can\u2019t have two armies sitting around doing nothing to be this guys friend.","Fair enough my dude","Did you know R2-D2 is apparently one of the top ranked players in the world?","Lol yeah","Wild","How\u2019d you get roped into this game?","A friend of mine is doing this study","Hbu?","Same lol","With an all out war with Obi-Wan Kenobi breaking out things might get hairy","Yeah","I want to avoid that at all costs","But you\u2019ve got to play your game","What\u2019s your long term plan? Maybe you can help mediate.","Ugh so I\u2019ll tell you the offer I made him","Ok man- this is what I\u2019m gonna propose- if you attack Paris and I take Marseilles- and I mean, what else are you really gonna do with that army?- I will fight like hell to give you two builds during Chewbacca\u2019s collapse","Like, imho we need to separate North Sea from The Chewbacca Question","If we don\u2019t steal a build from Chewbacca here we waste valuable time","Chewbacca doesn\u2019t threaten me directly tho. I would probably be allied with him if the guy was more chatty.","Eh if he decides to make moves he could threaten any of us","And that\u2019s the thing- he\u2019s not talkative or communicative.  Ergo, he is a Bad Ally","Talks breaking down between me and Obi-Wan Kenobi almost guarantees Chewbacca the channel. I offered an armistice in the North Sea (no fleet there) which would give us bother protection.","Can I mediate between you two?","What is this North Sea dispute?","We are talking about an armistice now, talks are being reopened.","Rgr, I stand ready to support","After Chewbacca, what\u2019s next?","That\u2019s a big question my dude, and I\u2019m open to your thoughts","I kinda want early game to shake out before making tough decisions","Understood. We have to see what this Anglo-Darth Vader alliance holds.","I\u2019ll just say that i consider you my close ally and have every intention of finishing this game that way.","Don\u2019t fuckin tell him this- but you are a closer ally than Obi-Wan Kenobi lol","I mean same bro","Did y\u2019all make a deal?","Like it\u2019s not inked but I just changed my orders based on the tentative terms","I feel like it\u2019s coming together, but it\u2019s not final","Rgr.  I mean my priority is helping us stay cohesive to beat Chewbacca- and taking Marseilles lol- so lmk how I can support y\u2019all in figuring something out.","Happy to offer to drive to the door of whoever breaks and alliance and punch them out  irl, just saying lol","\u201cMeet me in Temecula bro\u201d https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.sbnation.com\/platform\/amp\/lookit\/2014\/12\/26\/7449927\/snottiedrippin-temecula-christmas-twitter-fight-kobe-bryant","Lol","Excellent dude.  Thank you much.  Let\u2019s go get you some of those Chewbacca builds.","Of course man. Glad I could help!","Yo you see that order Obi-Wan Kenobi gave in Picardy to support a Paris attack on you in burgundy?  I think he fucked you.","Or tried and failed any way. Wtf was that.","Yeah maybe Chewbacca just didn\u2019t follow through...either way, doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of order you give accidentally.  Let\u2019s check in with Obi-Wan Kenobi, see if he has a good explanation, but I\u2019m not optimistic.","Yeah and here I fucked Luke Skywalker thinking this is the beginning of a great Anglo-Darth Vader team..","Imho- we need to put Luke Skywalker down ASAP so you can focus on this emerging Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Chewbacca nexus.","I mean we still have good odds if we\u2019re up against an Anglo-Chewbacca team, we\u2019ll just need to work closely.","We should talk builds when you can.  Idk if I\u2019m building army or navy, but you good with an agreement on no Munich\/Venice builds?","Oh no I was gonna build an army in Mun","But he\u2019s literally just there to support me into Warsaw","Yeah Obi-Wan Kenobi we\u2019ll see what he\u2019s really up to this year","Why no army in Berlin?  Just as close to warsaw, protects you against Luke Skywalkern navy fuckery","Or were you gonna army in Berlin also?","Yeah doing both. My Berlin army might get bogged down with that pesky ruski fleet","I really don\u2019t need a third fleet","Ahhh that\u2019s fair.  Guess I gotta trust you here.  Np np.","Luke Skywalker needs to die already lol.  I feel bad for the guy, but it\u2019s curtains time.","Yeah you\u2019ll see next turn I\u2019m not going after you","Yeah it\u2019s really sad. I haven\u2019t had the heart to look at whatever he sent me :\/","Literally just have an unopened message","Lmk if you want any advice on Chewbacca...if you got it covered, np- just want to support.","Sure happy to listen to advice","Sorry, away from my phone all day- mountain biking + swimming hole (I\u2019m on vacation rn)","Same lol","We\u2019ll work trip but same difference","Lol where to?","I mean, you may already be thinking this, but you gotta get all those armies out so they can all play a role in attacking Chewbacca and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  With all of them together, and support from me down south, you\u2019ll be in a good position imo.","Charlotte NC","Oh cool I\u2019m in Colorado rn","Do we need to talk about anything?  Anything I can do for ya?","Hey my dude, anything I can do to help move things forward against Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Chewbacca?","So I want Paris","Word.  I want you to have Paris!  How can I help!","Probably will have to wait til next year tho. I\u2019m gonna move in deeper into Chewbacca to support my guy in Paris next spring.","Basically just don\u2019t bounce me out if Gus","Thanks man!","Yessir.  I shan\u2019t.  Scout\u2019s honor.","I have an ask of you though (unrelated to the above)....","Can you lay off Luke Skywalker for a hot min while we kick Han Solo\u2019s ass?","Sure man what\u2019s up?","Uh I\u2019m gonna hit warsaw, I want that fleet gone","But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get it until next year","Uh that\u2019s fair.  I mean I\u2019d do the same if I was in your shoes.  I just want Han Solo gone, and that\u2019s gonna be a real long road without support from the north.","Thanks for understanding bro. It\u2019s a natural pick up for me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get it until next spring if that\u2019s any consolation","No no, I get it man.  Maybe you can help out with Han Solo when you get far enough east if we haven\u2019t cracked that nut by then, but all things in good time.","I may just try for Paris again instead of Gus, don\u2019t want you to think I lied to you if I run that move instead","My thought it I don\u2019t risk losing burg and who knows I just might take it","Rgr.  Stand ready to support whatever you decide.","This alliance is a two-way street and you\u2019ve been crushing it on your side of the avenue- just lmk how I can help!","Absolutely man! Thanks for being so supportive \ud83d\ude03","Hey man how\u2019s it going?","Hey dude- went to bed at 945 last night and just now seeing this.  My week for a busy work trip hahaha.  What\u2019s up?","Yo just a heads up- I think Obi-Wan Kenobi and R2-D2 are going to attack you in Warsaw...","Why do you think that?","R2-D2 has been really incommunicado recently and it\u2019s what I would do if I was him","Obi-Wan Kenobi is a homie tho.","Obi-Wan Kenobi getting a build- which Obi-Wan Kenobi needs!- is much less threatening to R2-D2 than you getting a build.","Now that Luke Skywalker is done and Chewbacca is close to being dead, what are you thinking for the future?","I mean, you know his interactions with you better than I do, but it seems like his back is up against the wall a bit here","Mannnn, I\u2019m Fence sitting as long as I can","I don\u2019t wanna make this choice","No chance for a three way Darth Vader R2-D2 Yoda victory huh","I\u2019m doing the same. R2-D2 kept trying to get me to attack Obi-Wan Kenobi but I stayed neutral.","I wish we could just all hug it out imo","Lol I agree!!!","I mean Idk about Obi-Wan Kenobi","I\u2019ve gotten mixed signals from him","And I haven\u2019t followed the Scandinavia brouhaha very closely honestly","What\u2019s good man?","Yooo what\u2019s up","So what\u2019s happening with that army in Munich???","Idk but I promise I won\u2019t hit you.","Tyrolia would threaten me obviously","Can you promise it\u2019s not going there?","Yes I can promise","So long as I can continue to expect non-aggression from you","Word","Similarly you have to understand if you move uni Tryolia I would see it as aggression :\/","Hoping we don\u2019t go there bro","Oh for sure","Neither of us move there","If we do we\u2019re fucks","Dirty no-good finks","Bitch boys","Asshats","I\u2019m totally game!!","Sounds good man. Glad we\u2019re on the same page here.","Sidebar- what\u2019re you gonna do about Obi-Wan Kenobi?","Based on the overtures he\u2019s making to me, he is not your friend","Woah dude R2-D2 knows my IRL name I\u2019m freaked rn","What","How","Yeah idk dude","Wtf","That\u2019s not cool man","Not cool at all","How does he know","Dude idk I\u2019m like freaked","I mean it was only my first name but I assume he like knows who I am IRL","Did he say it in a threatening way???","Context???","I think he was trying to get me to trust him but like it backfired big time","How did he say it","Just causally incorporated my first name into a chat","\u201cYou far overestimate me *******\u201d","Yikes","Yikes indeed","He\u2019s like freaking me out","I basically said that this gambit by using my irl name backfired because now I don\u2019t trust him","Let\u2019s talk dude","Yeah dude for sure","And he was like","\u201cWe never had had trust before\u201d","So I\u2019ve lost a LOTTT of respect for R2-D2","By him doing this gambit","\u201cYou thought we had trust. That is the mirage of diplomacy\u201d","How allied with Obi-Wan Kenobi are you?","Well I thought we were strong AF but idk now based on what you and R2-D2 are telling me","Strong AF as in, willing to end the game together?","Nah idk about that but strong enough to leave parts of our borders undefended","Strong enough he let me take the North Sea","Ok","What does a good endgame look like to you","I\u2019ve lost a lottt of respect for R2-D2 bc of this shit","At this point, R2-D2 getting knocked out. Beyond that I\u2019m an open book.","Are you willing to commit to me rn- no Obi-Wan Kenobi- for a shared victory","Np if you\u2019re not","And if you say no now, you\u2019re not necessarily foreclosing that option forever","Well me and Obi-Wan Kenobi are only committed to taking out R2-D2","I\u2019ve indicated I\u2019m open to a final two arrangement, but he hasn\u2019t agreed so I\u2019m open to an arrangement with you.","I mostly indicated my openness because I would feel more comfortable having a total and complete ally","Are you comfortable with revisiting this after we take out R2-D2? I don\u2019t want to make a final decision until my primary objective is complete","I appreciate that but I\u2019m not really comfortable waiting","Bc if we want and your answer is no, then I\u2019m fuckin hosed, yknow?","Okay I understand. I can agree if we can be agree to a reasonable arrangement with Obi-Wan Kenobi (aka I don\u2019t want to knife him until R2-D2 is disposed with because that is the terms of our alliance)","What is your idea of a reasonable arrangement with Obi-Wan Kenobi","Three way shares victory?","Me not attacking him until R2-D2 is gone","Also just strategically if we want R2-D2 gone, we shouldn\u2019t hit him right away.","Can you get on board with that? I\u2019m down to work with you to a two way victory so long has you don\u2019t expect me to knife Obi-Wan Kenobi earlier than I would like.","Let\u2019s revisit this in a turn?  I gotta go to bed- but I\u2019ve lost a lot of respect for him...and I need to think about how I see things evolving","Yeah if you want to take your time with Obi-Wan Kenobi that isn\u2019t an obstacle","That\u2019s my only issue. If your in, I\u2019m in.","Can\u2019t make decisions when I\u2019m this tired- but I think we have an agreement.","That army in Venice- where do you want it to go under this arrangement?","We need to move on R2-D2 all out ASAP","If I can trust you, into try","As a sign of trust here is my move set","Don\u2019t fuck me over tho","A Ber - Sil\nA Bur H\nF Den - HEL\nA Mun - Boh\nF NTH H\nA Par S Pic - Bre\nA Ruh - Mun\nA Sil - Gal\nA War S Sil - Gal","I will not fuck you over","I clearly trust you lol","Let\u2019s talk tomorrow","I can\u2019t make this big a decision rn","I trust you too","For sure","Rn- promise I won\u2019t move into tyrolia","That\u2019s what matters","Or tell anyone about this discussion","We have trust","Okay I mean you can if you go after R2-D2","Sounds good man!","Talk soon","Night dude","Night man","Hey man how\u2019s it going","What\u2019s up?","Hey- sorry I\u2019m just messaging now1 was driving all day yesterday","No sweat man.

My biggest advantage right now against him is only having one front.","Do you see any chance to keep Han Solo kicking a little longer?","Not really.  You know how Han Solo is- once the door gets kicked in they fall pretty quick- especially now that Constantinople is doa","Yeah it\u2019s over","Obi-Wan Kenobi and I couldn\u2019t get engaged fast enough, and Han Solo made some bad plays","He held on long all things considered!","Agreed dude!","Hope you\u2019re okay with my move into Tyr?","I didn\u2019t see your message about it until just now but I appreciate you giving me the heads up","We Gucci","I\u2019m off to bed now, but let\u2019s talk tomorrow and figure out where we go from here","Thanks bro.

Not talking to R2-D2 in the slightest- he keept asking me for help into tyrolia so I decided bumping everyone was the best I could do to keep you both equally pissed at me.","Truth is I think the game is basically over for me- would love for you to stay neutral in regards to me but do what u gotta do","I don\u2019t buy it","Yeah okay sounds good","Don\u2019t buy what?","I question if you\u2019re working with R2-D2 tbh","Nothing personal","I mean I get it bouncing makes sense if you\u2019re you\u2019re not paying attention","I mean that\u2019s fair","In the last 2 weeks- I got back from vacation, got swamped with work, and got dumped, so now basically all my free time is work and dating to try vainly to keep me from dying alone lol","Up to you to believe that or not!

It happens.  I hadn't gotten any messages from anyone so I was a little frustrated.  Glad that you at least are responsive","I reached out to Han Solo about an alliance but haven't heard from him.

I think the two of us would do well together","You ever do a blue water Lepanto?","I won\u2019t be responsive at all during work hours, just FYI- but I promise to make up for it by being EXTRA responsive when I\u2019m off work haha","I have not!  What\u2019re you thinking?  I\u2019m fine with going \u201cfull kimono\u201d with you (as it were)...obviously one of my builds needs to be Tunis, where do you think build 2 comes from?","This is also my first time playing as Yoda so idk what I\u2019m doing lol","So you probably won't get two builds this round because the only sc in reach mine and I won't love it if you attack me early \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02","But Tunis is a great call here and you can set yourself up to move into a good position against Han Solo while also taking Tunis","I would love to see you moving against Chewbacca here, so we can build a solid foundation to expand outward from- eventually my dream is to DMZ the Venice\/Trieste area","What\u2019s the blue water Lepanto tho?","I am skeptical of Chewbacca","He had been uncommunicative","Yeah, same with everyone else for me (Obi-Wan Kenobi has talked a bit).  I'm fully committed to you right now, and I'm hoping you feel the same way.","The Lepanto moveset is a Austro-Yoda moveset against Han Solo","The bluewater makes it more difficult for Han Solo to see the attack coming and thus defend it","It's my go-to opening as R2-D2, or as Yoda working with R2-D2","I\u2019ll be honest- I\u2019m pretty close to saying fuck it and going all in with you hahaha","I mean- if I get out of the game w\/e, I\u2019m Yoda and I\u2019m SUPER busy at work, I have low expectations","Would be happy to hear that- I'm all in rn","Having a relatively committed Ally is all I ask","In the words of the fyre festival guy, \u201cLet's just do it and be legends, man.\u201d","It's hard to express how poor this level of Diplomacy is rn","I haven't lied nor recieved a lie, as far as I'm aware","So you\u2019ve played diplomacy a lot then?","Quite a bit.

A) it would be very like someone to fuck with me in this whole endeavor and pretend to be someone else.  B) I\u2019m always skeptical of people coming on strong for alliances very early.  C) if you\u2019re an experience diplomacy player, I\u2019m sure you love yourself a solo victory.  But!  I\u2019m fuckin Yoda, and if you are as good a diplomacy player as you say you are, Ive got very little shot if I don\u2019t cooperate with you.

I'll see if I can find the original recruiting message and screenshot it","Would I like to win? Yeah.  However, the research element is kind of interesting to me, I get compensation regardless of my final gameplay, and this game is low stakes compared to most of the ones I play","I'm more than happy to ally long term with you","No need to dig up your recruitment forum post!","I trust you","As much or slightly more so than is normal in this situation haha","Besides, if you\u2019re the only person returning my calls, you\u2019re the only game in town lol","So what moves should I make here to start the game?

It's R2-D2 driven, but pretty balanced.  The Bluewater is geared towards R2-D2 because getting the retreat is essential, but the outcome is the same as a classic lepanto","Yeah I\u2019m all in","Send me dat shit and I\u2019ll fill my orders out tomorrow for the Wednesday noon deadline- bedtime soon for me","Fucking lol","Same here, what time zone and work schedule you on?","https:\/\/diplomacy.fandom.com\/wiki\/The_Blue_Water_Lepanto","Yes bot, my fucking link is true \ud83d\ude02","EST","busy 730ish until 730pm ish with little to no phone access (Sorry, I know!) but around otherwise","Ok- read some of this, will save the rest for tomorrow.  I\u2019m off to bed, catch you tomorrow.","Same here for the schedule.  It was a slow day at work, so I was texting. Normally I can't.  I'm busy 7:30a-7p on weekdays, so this works out","Out of work just FYI","Just got out myself","Do we have anything more we need to talk about?  I still am In on this alliamce, gonna do the lepanto","Like dis","I think we're good.  Thanks for confirming","Fuck","Only the lie emoji showed up and I clicked it by accident.  I hope this doesn't mess with the results","Lol I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about it","What moves are you gonna make?  Not gonna tell anyone- just want to have something to hold you too later","Yeah, no worries, I'll be standard opening probably, depending on what Warsaw does: Vie-Gal, Tri-Alb, Bud-Serb","I'll let you know if those change","Cool cool","Just wanna have something to hold you to so in the understandable event that you do stab me, I can know quickly lol","Yeah, I'll let you know if I vary from that.  A tip- most good Diplomacy players, they just manipulate the circumstances of the moves","They don't ever lie to someone's face.  It's a waste of a valuable connection","Mhmm rgr","Aside from the misclick earlier, I haven't lied this game","\u201cOh I was GONNA do that, but then x and y FORCED ME to do this other thing\u201d","I getcha","Yeahhh, or I get someone else to attack you while I work with you.  I'm not doing that, nobody's responsive enough to do that, but it's a strategy I might use in a tournament game","Come join the Nexus server! You would enjoy it!","https:\/\/discord.gg\/P5vyvz8","Lol I\u2019m not the best at diplomacy, but I have played before and I do enjoy it!  I haven\u2019t lied either so far this game...In a world where literally anyone else in this game is communicative, our relationship would look very different, but that is clearly not the case here lol","Can I take you up on that another time?  I\u2019m ridiculously busy with work rn- and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t want to join a game unless I could give it my full attention.","On that note, I\u2019m off to bed- hmu in the am if you want, otherwise I\u2019ll catch you after orders resolve!","It's just a community, it wouldn't commit you to anything yet.  We have essentially the same schedules...I'm in bed rn","I'm not trying to turn anyone on you :).  The stakes are low enough and I'm having fun","Cool, just joined- saw season 3 starts aug 25!","Yes!","Plan change: Vie is going to Bud","Hey!  Left work early today- FASCINATING game, especially in the north.","What\u2019re your thoughts for next turn?  Think there\u2019s an opportunity with Darth Vader?","I\u2019m probably going easy build with Tunis unless you think Greece is an option for me","Go for Tunis, idk if Greece is guaranteed yet.  Luke Skywalker is a dumbass but I told him to do that.  He and Han Solo are pretty new and I could take them both myself if you want to move on Chewbacca","Yeah you\u2019re gonna get BEAUCOUP builds this turn man","Yeah it feels like I\u2019m playing things a bit safe this turn but w\/e","I put a bit of time into that relationship but whatever","What relationship?","You have to play this safe.  I'm honestly thinking of covering Tri here just in case. I don't NEED Rum yet","Han Solo and Luke Skywalker","Ahhh I see","Yeah I\u2019m not making moves oh truest obviously","*on trieste","That buys me a build at the expense of fucking me in the medium term (not even long term lol)","Yeah, I'm not sure that would be a great idea for either of us","Any advice on what I should do with that army???","I would love to see you push Chewbacca, but I'm obviously biased of course.  At the least, if you would move it away from Tri I would be obliged","What do you want Darth Vader to do here?  Help you take on Chewbacca or stay well out of the area so you can take most of him yourself?","Hmmm a few thoughts","shoot","I want *something* for moving away from Trieste.  Can we go ahead and make Trieste-Venice a DMZ until further notice?","Full warning- you\u2019re positioning for a lot of builds, so I\u2019m obviously a little wary of a super strong R2-D2 right up in my biznass","Absolutely- that's my intent","I'm not taking Rum this turn, and I'm planning to make Han Solo mad.  Those are both true","You can trust me.  I really have too much potential in the east to want to piss off the only true ally I'll have by 1902.","Ok- so none of my armies\/navies in Venice after this build, none of yours in Trieste.  Done deal.","Second- yeah, I want Darth Vader\u2019s help with Chewbacca- with the UK going elsewhere, I need something to distract Chewbacca.  What\u2019ve your discussions with Darth Vader been like?","I may in the future need to build a fleet in Tri to attack Han Solo.  I'll let you know when and you can respond with a build in kind","I don't have any other coastal provinces so my options are limited","Rgr.  I just need prior notification that I have the chance to see and acknowledge.","that's fine for me","thanks for being agreeable","No worries.","Ok, here are my goals for this turn: Darth Vader can't let Luke Skywalker into Sweden this turn, but Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker need to partner up against Obi-Wan Kenobi in the future.  Have Obi-Wan Kenobi attack Chewbacca this turn, and you finish Chewbacca off","Here's the way this will play out","Obi-Wan Kenobi will move aggressively on Chewbacca, pulling Chewbacca's attention northward while you come in.  A weak Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader will move on Obi-Wan Kenobi afterward, reversing the course of Obi-Wan Kenobi's fleets and staving off his attack on Chewbacca.  Chewbacca, who committed defensively to the north, will not be able to ward you off and you can slide in.  Obi-Wan Kenobi will be next and Luke Skywalker is falling around this time as well.  Darth Vader will be left and we can figure out a plan from there","This stays between you can me.  I'm not in the mood for message forwards right now","Rgr.  You can trust me.","Only issue I have is- how CAN Obi-Wan Kenobi attack Chewbacca?  He can go to Belgium, but why would he, and that isn\u2019t *that* bad for Chewbacca...","Obi-Wan Kenobi should be wanting belgium","If the two of us (plus Darth Vader) convince him to take on Chewbacca, he'll take on Chewbacca","Is he tho?  Have you talked to him?","Diplomacy players are like sheep and will follow the crowd.  Two is a crown, if played effectively","Yep","Working on him right now","Hmmm lemme know what he says...he hasn\u2019t talked to me yet","No, this on is on you now.  You need to get Darth Vader to ask Obi-Wan Kenobi to hit Chewbacca with the two of you","Obi-Wan Kenobi will comply","Hokay, will try","The real trick is keeping Luke Skywalker busy with Darth Vader for one turn","Any ideas what I should do with my apulia army?","Can you ask Darth Vader to bounce Luke Skywalker in sweden?","Convoy that sucker to Tunis","Ah doy, yes","Yeah I\u2019m talking to Darth Vader rn.  Will make a plug.","Thanks.  Make it happen \ud83d\ude03","I'm really not trying to control you.  This is just a pretty straightforward game if we play it right, and Yoda\/R2-D2 rarely pull a good game out together, so I am excited about our chances","Dude, I am a-ok with taking advice\/guidance from you and being the junior partner hahaha","Awesome!  Let's steamroll this game!","At the point where Chewbacca is unwilling to partner, you\u2019re my best chance for making it to late game-  any backstab of you is so clearly not in my medium\/long term interests hahaha","And vice versa.  I'm not in the mood of wrecking this game over a dumb stab","Hoping to bounce Han Solo in Rum","Get Obi-Wan Kenobi going towards Chewbacca","I pitched Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader but they are very uncommunicative","Are you getting any vibes from them?","Obi-Wan Kenobi is thinking about attacking Darth Vader.  If you can take on Chewbacca alone, I'm fine with that","I just don't want Luke Skywalker tough, that's all","We've got to talk builds","I\u2019m out of work now","Surely do!","You gotta build in Trieste don\u2019t you...let\u2019s work out some assurances","You got your word for a weak Luke Skywalker huh!","FYI- I am lying to Han Solo rn- let\u2019s talk when you can","Ayyy we gotta talk","I don't like the western dynamics at all","Chewbacca's convoy was sneaky and Obi-Wan Kenobi set up Belgium too well","Darth Vader lied to me about Berlin","Yeahhhh it\u2019s concerning","So context for me- I\u2019m trying to persuade Han Solo not to build a fleet in the south","By saying I\u2019m more concerned about you and Chewbacca.","Good","What\u2019re you thinking for your builds?","Do I want a fleet Tri? It would help with the Han Solo takedown","I forgot about Han Solo getting Sev.  That's a pain in my ass","I would obviously prefer fleet Trieste lol","And I\u2019m trusting you here obviously","Good, I wanted F tri but wanted you to say it.  F Tri A vie. Han Solo is stupidly strong already, I told Luke Skywalker how to defend and he didn't do it","It\u2019s all Gucci my dude.  He can\u2019t beat you me and Luke Skywalker.","And that\u2019s what he\u2019s gonna be up against.","Just make sure I get builds out of his downfall.","Yeah.  Chewbacca is strong now too","Darth Vader is thinking about allying with him","Chewbacca is always strong early","If you can get Chewbacca going against Obi-Wan Kenobi away from you, you can get the jump on him","Just have to hope that favorable geography will save me","Yeah but he's relatively consequence free","And Obi-Wan Kenobi","They all are.  I'm pressuring Chewbacca to build up North for you","You'll need a fleet here to assert Med dominance","Oh for sure","I was thinking Fleet napoli","Yeah that's fine","More flexibility that way for you","FYI I\u2019m telling everyone that I\u2019m building an army in Venice","To guard against you","But I ain\u2019t lol","You can, but honestly preserve your social capital.  It's your call.  I don't think I've lied yet and I don't think I will this game.  Save your lie for the two center stab, not the build position","I mean I\u2019m telling Han Solo that","Not everyone","Kk","But your advice is well taken","What\u2019re you telling Han Solo?","I may need you to forward some messages to Han Solo in the future","I'm congratulating him on getting into Luke Skywalker","Rgr","Here to help!","Thanks.  Lmk if you ever need it from me","Will do.  Not gonna forward any messages without explicit permission as a rule- so I\u2019ll check in with you if we need to.","Ty ty","Let\u2019s circle up again post builds but I don\u2019t think we need to talk about anything more this order cycle!","Best of luck with Chewbacca.  Try to get him to build up North","Yeah, we're good","I'm trying hard for you","Likewise my dude.  Lmk how I can facilitate your Han Solo discussions through message sharing or otherwise.","\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c","Think it\u2019s to my advantage to talk to Chewbacca, based on your convos with him?","Can't hurt","Can you find out Han Solo's planned S02 moves without being obvious about it?  I need to coordinate with Luke Skywalker","I\u2019ll try but honestly, probably can\u2019t-  He\u2019s not going to be happy about my fleet build.  Right now we\u2019re talking about convoying Tunis into Greece which, lol","You can easily explain the build.  The fleet gives you more leverage against me, both in the short and long run","I\u2019ll try!  Will report back.  Let\u2019s coordinate later on next moves but we\u2019ve got a little breathing space.","Sure","Let\u2019s talk when you can.  I\u2019m taking some flights today but otherwise I\u2019m around.","I'm here. Hit me.","What\u2019re you thinking for moves?  Right now I\u2019m planning to send my fleets towards Han Solo and make a move for Marseilles hoping to bounce- then move my army in Tunis forward- but I\u2019m curious what your thoughts are, and how I can plug into your strategy.","Both seem good.  I'd split the fleets, one west and one east, but that's just me","I assume you\u2019re going full court press on Han Solo?","That's true","While keeping Luke Skywalker in my pocket","And Chewbacca?","Chewbacca is saying he doesn\u2019t want war...I think Obi-Wan Kenobi is down to get him but idk what Darth Vader is feeling.  I\u2019m divided between going all in on Han Solo Vice dividing my efforts between him and Chewbacca","I\u2019m probably not getting more than one build out of Han Solo am I?","Luke Skywalker wants something out of this too and soon there will be very little Han Solo for anyone","Han Solo will be a tough nut to crack and I want to be honest and say I don't know.  You'll definitely get a build but I don't want you to have to overcommit that way","So long as I get one build I\u2019m a happy camper.","I'll do my best to make that happen","Because ultimately, starving you out of a build would make you turn on me eventually.  You can know I'm telling the truth about giving you builds because I don't want you to fall far behind and become jealous of the growth of your neighbors.  Does that make sense?","Nah I\u2019m with it","I trust you","Just gimme smyerna, that\u2019s all Yoda wants","lol kk. Let's do this","Can you see my profile pic or is it just the default Discord one?","Can we just check plans here? Your committing a single fleet to Han Solo and the other towards Chewbacca?","Default pic I\u2019m afraid","Yeah.  Happy to discuss em in more detail iffff you\u2019d like.  What\u2019s your strategy?  What\u2019re you doing with that fleet in Trieste?","Heading down into the Adriatic here.  Trying to contain Han Solo","Darth Vader is worried about an EF","Hmm why Adriatic Vice Albania?  Sure you have your reasons, just curious","Yeah...Darth Vader is telling me he thinks Chewbacca and Obi-Wan Kenobi are allies.  Would be bad.","In all honesty, for the pressure.  I have no plans to lie to you, but if you happened to support Han Solo into Greece or something, I would have options to respond in the fall","Fair enough man.  That said, that makes me a bit worried about a stab right before build phase.  Anything I can offer you to not do that?","Send that second fleet towards Chewbacca and we should be fine \ud83d\ude09 I think you were planning on that anyway, so that shouldn't be too much of a pain","Lol I think we can do that buddy","Rn I was thinking Napoli to TYS, ION to EAS- that copacetic by you?","Perfect","Great!  In return I can expect that fleet to go to Albania instead of Adriatic, yes?  Just want to make sure we don\u2019t have any misunderstandings!","Yep!  Good clarification","Yeeeee, let\u2019s do the damn thing my man","Yo- if you\u2019re there, does it make more sense for Ionian to go to Aegean so it can support stuff up there?","Won\u2019t make that move without your go ahead but wanted to ask","Eh fuck it, let\u2019s not dick around with it.  See you after moves resolve!","Yeah sorry, I had to sleep.  A decent moveset for us both, looks like you'll be able to force Marseilles in the near future","The best part is that Ven and Tri are successfully DMZ","No worries man.  We\u2019re in a good place for sure.","Is Darth Vader supporting Mar here?","I sure think so- not sure that move makes any sense otherwise","Han Solo is likely to reach out to you here.  Can you ascertain his moves and lmk his plans? I'll do the same for you if he'll tell me","Word","The EF showdown is good to see","Looks like Darth Vader was wrong there","Yah Chewbacca\u2019s game is a bit of a mess rn.  Sidebar- just signed up for a game on nexus!!!","Amazing! Good to have you! What game?","What has Darth Vader said about support to Mar?","Not in yet, but filled out a google form for backstabbr!","He hasn\u2019t said shit...about anything....I\u2019m getting nervous.  Have you talked to him today?  I was planning to hit him back up around 530 EST","Nothing yet, he may be working like us","Well I\u2019m on vacation this week- hence my responsiveness hahaha","But your point is well-taken- is why I was gonna wait to engage him until after EST working hours.","Lol","He just got back to me","Nice!  I\u2019ll give him a few min.","How goes it friend?","I'm all set","You?","Yeah, I think same","Darth Vader agreed to let you into Mar","Trying to work Chewbacca to my advantage but I feel good","Yeah but- and let\u2019s keep this part secret- Chewbacca can block it right?","If he attacks burgundy to cancel Darth Vader\u2019s support","Right","So I\u2019m trying to finesse that","But if you're going to Lyo you get it no matter what","In spring","We\u2019ll see if I am successful and we\u2019ll see if Chewbacca is smart enough to make that play","And you'll get smy for certain in 1903","Yeah, Obi-Wan Kenobi may be looking strong","So honestly I was thinking that I\u2019d go into WES instead to convoy that army into Spain later","Do you think that\u2019s dumb?  I just don\u2019t like it just chilling in Tunis","Hahaha excellent!!!","Why did Luke Skywalker hold in Moscow???  Makes no sense","He's not great :\/","Your Wes idea works out well lol","Lol thank you- calculated risk but it paid off.","You see Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s order to Picardy tosupport a Chewbacca attack from Paris to burgundy?  I fear we\u2019re seeing a Chewbacca\/Obi-Wan Kenobi axis emerge after all...","Do you think you could put a word in Chewbacca\u2019s ear about what unit he should disband?","Also, looking at this game, Darth Vader is about to be very strong- do you trust him?  He\u2019s my second tier ally after you, but idk if he\u2019d start going after you....","He's not going after me.  I set him up against Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He'll be busy for a while","You told Obi-Wan Kenobi to do that?  Or you told Darth Vader to go after Obi-Wan Kenobi?","Also, when you can- whatrecyou thinking re: upcoming builds.","I told both to attack each other.  Very truthfully of course.  The point is to get Darth Vader to distract Obi-Wan Kenobi from helping you and keep G busy fighting a war it will take a while to win.","By the time G is done with Obi-Wan Kenobi, you and I will have turned around and will be ready to move against him","Lol we should have deconflicted- I spent a lot of time last night trying to get Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader to play nice at least few the next turn.  I assume you don\u2019t want Obi-Wan Kenobi to help me bc you don\u2019t want me to get too strong?","Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca were allied.  I'm thinking long term about our strategy. Obi-Wan Kenobi won't help you- as evidenced by the fact that even after you spent a long time talking to him last night, he still supported Chewbacca against you.","Think big picture here about how things will play out after you finish off Chewbacca.  This isn't about you getting too strong, it's about Darth Vader getting too strong","No no I support your play here.","Gotcha. I trust you, and want to see you succeed :)","Just your phrasing- \u201cget Darth Vader to distract Obi-Wan Kenobi from helping you\u201d- I thought I\u2019d ask about it.","Gotcha, I trust you and want to see you succeed! Let's do this!","No no, same!  This is working out real well all things considered.","I meant Chewbacca, my bad","I'm typing a little too fast at work and I'm a bit distracted \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02","Ah see I figured something like that.  We good homie.","No worries my dude!  I\u2019m free to talk builds whenever, but we can wait until later today- just lmk.","Han Solo took his back so I'll probably just go A Vie","I\u2019m divided on army Rome or fleet Napoli- feels like the southern oceans are a bit crowded and another navy is overkill- welcome your thoughts, but I won\u2019t build anything in venice \ud83d\ude09","I'm fine with either.  You may struggle to fully take the Iberian without another fleet and you have that one army in Tunis to bring to bear on the mainland","Supporting you into Smyrna this turn, can you do the same for me into Con in the fall?","Assuming I get into Smyrna of course, done deal.  You can count on it!","Amazing.  This is such a great start","All out enemies are focused elsewhere, really the perfect setup","I miss Diplomacy so much.  I'm normally too busy with the Nexus to play actual games and I've recused myself from tournament games so I'm not accused of conflict of interest","But that means I don't play as often as I'd like","Glad we can get some good diplomacy time in for yah my dude \ud83d\ude03","This is getting me back into the game, not gonna lie- rusty start but I\u2019m remembering how much I enjoy it again.  Glad I\u2019m on vacation this week so I can really geek out properly \ud83d\ude03","This is the best week to be free.  Game will get slow as we pull ahead","I planned it that way clearly \ud83d\ude09","Do you think it makes sense for you to put a word in Chewbacca\u2019s ear on what unit he should disband?","Go for it","No I mean for you to do it hahaha- he won\u2019t trust me and we don\u2019t have that relationship","If you don\u2019t either nbd, but clearly going \u201chey, I\u2019m a ranked diplomacy player, here\u2019s what I think you should do\u201d has worked out ok for you so far lol","Which unit you want gone?","I'm usually not that forceful.  I'd be a lot more subtle.  There's a million ways to do it and that tactic wouldnt work here","Yeah I can","Oh lol","I mean If that fleet in MAO disappears I ain\u2019t mad","Haha kk","I\u2019m reticent to suggest it bc I think then he may go \u201coh fuck now I definitely don\u2019t want to disband that fleet\u201d hahaha","I'll let you know how it goes","No worries either way dude- but I appreciate it!","He wasn't responded to me, although I reached out","Not sure it will happen, he doesn't seem to be online","It would remove the farthest unit from his home then right, if he doesn\u2019t submit orders?  Which is either the fleet or the Spain army i think","Sidebar- Darth Vader is building an army in Munich- just a heads up.","You\u2019re still going army Vienna yes?","Army Bud","Awww I think you\u2019re my bud too pal","Jk I know what you meant","Hilarious","Do we need to talk about anything?  Anything I can do for ya?  Our Smyrna deal stands.","You got my back into Smyrna again?","I didn't last night, I had a last minute change of heart because I saw a better moveset.  I have you this time though","I'm also hitting Con so that unit can't support Smy","What's going on with Darth Vader?","I really need you to hit Constantinople AND support me into Smyrna- so that army in Armenia (I think?) can\u2019t bounce me.  Is that doable?","Both are doable and done","That's still not a guarantee you'll get it, but we'll try out best","Darth Vader got Luke Skywalker to fuck up and it indirectly cost you a center","So I'm not particularly happy rn","What did Darth Vader do?","By threatening Luke Skywalker, which wasn't the plan, Luke Skywalker isn't in position to take back STP in the fall and thus we can't pressure that Arm unit","So Arm is free to defend Smy, which means we're not likely to get it","Yeah between that and Chewbacca making a optimal disband decision that will make Iberia take longer, things are slowing down for us a bit.  Not the end of the world- but I was hoping Chewbacca and Han Solo would be well on their way to dead by now.","Han Solo and Obi-Wan Kenobi are notoriously hard to kill, but Darth Vader is incredibly unhelpful","Yeah Darth Vader senses Luke Skywalker is dying and he\u2019s making a grab.  Can\u2019t blame him tbqh but it complicates our stuff for sure.","If I get another build in Iberia next year I can help speed things along.","Going biking- feel free to message but I\u2019ll respond later.","Luke Skywalker's not dying to him.  Luke Skywalker's dying to Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Notice the reposition in the north","Please put some pressure on Darth Vader to keep all focus on Obi-Wan Kenobi","Also also, he asked me not to give you Smyrna.  He's playing tricky and he's doing it badly","Rgr will teyZ","*try","Do we have anything to talk about?","I'd like to tell Darth Vader to stop giving Obi-Wan Kenobi a free pass, but I'm running out of ways to do it","Yeahhhh I tried to tell him that and no dice.","Nah I don\u2019t think so- you\u2019ve got my back x2 with Smyrna, which probably won\u2019t work but \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af- can you think of anything to discuss?","He\u2019s going after Luke Skywalker while the getting is good.","I\u2019m telling Han Solo we\u2019re having an argument to see if it makes him discount the prospect of you supporting me into Smyrna...hail Mary but idc","Han Solo and I have been communicative, I can help on the end","Yeah, it's worth a try","Also, Darth Vader isn't getting Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi will","I don't see why no one gets that","Yeah feel free to tell R2-D2 we\u2019re beefing- may muddy the waters","Man- and I say this with all due respect- I think you\u2019re so far more skilled than most of the people playing (I include myself in that group!), you just see shit others don\u2019t","You\u2019re in the land of the blind...except you have two eyes...so you\u2019re not king, you\u2019re just a know it all (if that analogy makes any sense) \ud83d\ude09","I'll tell myself we're beefing","That'll really confused him ;)","Will do","Hahaha no sweat.  You're good at flattery, you should play Diplomacy","Lollll","So we have a bit of a problem","Talk to me","I just landed back on the east coast","What\u2019s up dude","Not a great turn","Actually a very bad turn","Talk to me- what hard choices are we faced with for next turn?","Let's see what Han Solo disbands","Priority number one is to get Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader turned against each other, or they will be too big for us to handle later. Obi-Wan Kenobi can make it really hard for us to finish off Han Solo, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader together can probably take most of Chewbacca. We need to split them up.","Agreed for sure.  Will try to sow dissent among them.","What\u2019s your build going to be?","A Vie or Bud","Leaning towards Vie right now","I've gotten nothing from anyone else","This isn't a great look for us. Stay strong against Chewbacca and Han Solo. We'll have a stalemate line soon","Neither have I...but tbqh Idk if that\u2019s just bc it\u2019s the weekend\/people perceive at this stage there\u2019s not much to talk about.","Unless there\u2019s been some miraculous Obi-Wan Kenobi-Darth Vader rapprochement- Which I haven\u2019t seen!- I think we\u2019re good","I mean Darth Vader and I have discussed next moves","You still supporting me into Smyrna per last turn?","So we need to shift some units or we can't get it","But I can get you in Fall 1903","Keep Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi split","It\u2019s 1904 now","I get that keeping Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca split is the overwhelming priority but I\u2019d love to see movement on Smyrna by the end of this year","Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader, yeah","And we can't get Smy unless you move to Syria here","If I do that, you move AEG to EAS and Greece to AEG in preparation for an attack next turn?","And yeah, sorry- slipped up there","Exactly","Ah shit.  Sorry man- went to bed at 945 and forgot to change that order.  Super sorry.","Yeah, that sucked. However, the good news is that I got into Sev, so he may try a different defensive moveset this time. I think we are a go for a supported attack of Smyrna","Assume it's us against Han Solo, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Vader for the rest of the game","We honestly got lucky that turn","Roger that.  Will push ahead with Smyrna attack.  Apologies again.  Things are looking good!","It's a bit of guessing here, but fortunately we have Han Solo on lockdown for now.  Keep Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader against each other.  Tell Darth Vader that you heard Obi-Wan Kenobi plans to attack Warsaw with my support or something","Actually tell him exactly that","Done","Great.  Hopefully there will be fireworks.  If they go to war, we win","Even if they give up the fight after a year","Supporting you into Smyrna here, confirm?","Yes, sorry, just saw this, Shame it didn\u2019t work","Good turn I think...thoughts on builds?  I was thinking army in Venice time","Where do you plan for that unit to go? You want to take on Darth Vader here?","Also, provided you continue to work with me here, you get Smyrna this season, guaranteed. The units Han Solo needs to support Smyrna need to be disbanded here","Ayyyy I\u2019m definitely working with you first things first","You...are my fire.  Our alliance...my one desire.","But yeah, that was the plan.  At least give myself some cover over there from any designs he might have.  Idk, med feels full of ships, and I can\u2019t think of any other builds unless you can suggest one","I would personally prefer to see an army build in Rom, which would go Tus-Pie-Mar","Just bc an army in Venice threatens you?","The problem is you're in a bit of a dilemma.  You have a lot of ships, true, but not a ton of room for another army","But it's your call","I\u2019m gonna try to convoy the army in n Africa to Chewbacca; I feel like an army in Rome will just get stuck behind Marseilles for a long while","I think any army does, which is the problem","Yeah I mean the problem is MAO is clearly a choke point also","Unless I shoot an army straight up from Venice at Munich","Get Chewbacca to support you in.  The dude is desperate","The tyr move will be a tough sell to me :D","Especially if I'm helping you into Smyrna","\ud83d\ude18","You don\u2019t trust me at this point???","So I gotta go to bed soon- just messaged Chewbacca and no response- so let\u2019s assume we need to make this decision amongst ourselves","I\u2019m trying to make a build that brings maximum benefit to this alliance.  I\u2019m open to other suggestions if you can identify something that brings us more value!","Talk to me here- this has been going so well, I don\u2019t want things to fall apart now","Ok man- bedtime for me- hope I see a fleet from you in Vienna.  Then we can start to move against Darth Vader etc.","Shit shit, I'm still here","Real life stuff took me away for a sec","It's not that I don't trust you right now, I'm a Diplomacy player and I prefer manufactured trust, built up through our DMZ. It means I can work well with you without worrying about an imminent stab, and vice versa, which is easier for both of us","I would prefer to keep that up so we can continue to work together without distraction","You seem like a nice guy dril :)","Heading to bed myself- I'm sure it'll work out","Sorry about that- had a hard 9pm stop last night.  Happy to discuss moves today- honestly considering moving Venice over to piedmont to protect Marseilles (in which case...sorry I even built it in Venice in the first place!).  Regardless- we\u2019ll take it out.","*TALK it out","I don't blame you. I don't think the build was a great one but sometimes that happens","The main point is that Darth Vader is terrifying and needs to be pulled apart.  We can't slip into his centers, but if you and Obi-Wan Kenobi take him from the West while Obi-Wan Kenobi and I take him on in Luke Skywalker, we have a chance","Agreed re: Darth Vader.  Wish we\u2019d had more time to discuss that build but it happens.","What have your interactions with Obi-Wan Kenobi been like?  Agreed, Darth Vader is realllll real strong- but he seems to be on good terms with Obi-Wan Kenobi, at least from Darth Vader\u2019s optic.","I'm not concerned about the build, let's definitely talk next moves tonight though","Our #1 focus is splitting Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Han Solo is still too strong for us to start to pull off him","Ok agreed","Let\u2019s talk whenever- I\u2019m gonna go to bed early but hopefully less early than last night","Hmu whenever and we\u2019ll talk strategy","Here rn off and on. This is important and we need to be reaching out to Obi-Wan Kenobi early too.  Let's figure this out now","Rgr","What\u2019re your thoughts?","(On moves specifically)","I'd like to finish off Han Solo here without Obi-Wan Kenobi fucking me.","If you can make sure that he doesn't support an attack on Moscow, you get Smyrna","Wow wow wow","I thought we were coordinating moves here","We are","And I thought I was getting Smyrna regardless","This is the first step","Not conditional on me making Obi-Wan Kenobi do something I have no power to make him do","I can't tap arm unless Mos is safe, see?","And then neither of us get anything","I thought you were threatening me","Ahhh ok","Not explaining how to make this happen","Ofc not","lol","Lol it seemed a little unsubtle for you","I just messaged Obi-Wan Kenobi","What should I tell him","He responded","Getting Smyrna is a priority for me, so I wanted to let you know the best way for us to do it","Do I have any moves to talk about with you?","Yeah","But we'll get there","Start with the easy stuff ;)","Like what I should tell Obi-Wan Kenobi rn lol","Ask him to hit Moscow and talk about how dangerous Darth Vader is","Like anything productive for that unit to be doing other than hitting me","I'm working on him too","Ok","I'm making progress","Let's talk about us now","Rgr","What us stuff would you like to discuss???","Btw just sent this to Obi-Wan Kenobi \"One of us has to move into it by the end of the year. Darth Vader is building to move against me, Han Solo is still a pain in the butt, and Yoda is getting testy.  I need your help to crack this dude, and I can't be running damage control for the board on my own\"","Just roll with it if he asks","Let's talk about that Venice unit","Absolutely.  It\u2019s not going into Trieste obviously lol","But I assume you wanted a deeper discussion haha","Yeah, where is it going? I hate to say it, but Tyr may be the right option","Mhmmm so I was thinking piedmont to bolster my army in Marseilles against Darth Vader pressure","(I can always pull it back to Venice if he moves to tyrolia)","Lolll ok","But tell me more about your thinking re: tyroli","I'd like to lock up that front and not have to worry about the north for the next two years","Assume he will","You'd get your Smy center and ONCE we turn away from Han Solo, you can bet I'm coming hard for the north","But I'd rather open a temporary front up there for now","That Marseilles army is mighty vulnerable tho","Of course holding Marseilles isn't bad, but you should have built a fleet for that","That's true too","Once he gets into Gascony","Army can do that AND cover Venice from Darth Vader predations","Better build for me","Which is why it's PIVOTAL for us to get Darth Vader to hit Obi-Wan Kenobi and vice versa","And Darth Vader shouldn't need coaxing","But he does for some reason.  These players aren't recognizing opportunities","Kinda like ya","I mean they seem to be close allies lol","*us","Right","What else do we gotta discuss","Ok then lol, you can move to pie.","I'll try to figure it out with Obi-Wan Kenobi.  This turn may suck.  I may just pull back from Han Solo to cover up the north myself","But we need to get G and E turned on each other","This is the most pivotal turn of the game","Darth Vader can get two more this turn and two more after that, which would be thirteen and Obi-Wan Kenobi would be powerless to stop him","We wouldn't be in position to help Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader would get up to 16 by the time we finish Han Solo and you get around the MAO chokepoint","Yeahhhh","Darth Vader...has done nicely","I\u2019m confused why","\/how, rather","But we\u2019re good on moves???","Nothing more to discuss?","We're good.  Can you tell Darth Vader that he should move on Edinburgh and Norway here?","Am communicating rn","Darth Vader says you know his real name?","wtf","Yeah","How","He\u2019s freaked","Yeah, clearly","I think it's working though","How did you get his irl name","If the goal is to make him do your bidding, idk if that\u2019ll work","No, the point is a little more subtle","I can explain after the game","Mhmmm","Do you know my irl name?","Would it help us win the game if I did?","Sure","Dude that\u2019s kinda creepy","That you know that","It's not that creepy.  If we do AARs, I'll talk about it and my reason for name dropping","Ehhh talk about it now why not","I won\u2019t repeat anything you say","I\u2019m just concerned about the extent to which the veil of anonymity has been pieced","I'll keep it at that.","Nearly 0","Mhmmm I need you to give me some more info man","Darth Vader shares a lot about his personal life","That should answer your questions","I\u2019m not sure this accomplished what you wanted","I think it did.  I don't think Darth Vader knows what I was going for.  I pulled an old trick on him, but it accomplished a couple points","Although","It did freak him out far more than I intended","I've had people look me up on facebook, my gf, my family","He willfully volunteered his information, so I'm a bit surprised he's surprised","I think this is a case of you not appreciating that he\u2019s probably more casual than you haha","Do you know my name","No","We good","Yep","I\u2019m gonna get Smyrna before next builds won\u2019t I","That's the plan.  It's a guessing game with Han Solo as you can see","You're going to get it this turn, possibly at the cost of my losing Sev","That\u2019ll be ok tho","Bc we\u2019ll get it back \ud83d\ude03","As a TEAM","Ok bed now","Night!!!","Night","Welp","The lines are drawn.  If we hadn't gotten Smyrna this round I would have had to stop supporting it","Also I really wish you had moved to Tyr now. Whatever. Hindsight 20\/20","Well I could lose Smyrna pretty easily next turn if you don\u2019t either support me or blast Constantinople","So I\u2019m not happy just yet","It looks like you mismanaged Darth Vader tbqh","Hell if I were God and could do everything, I would have one the game now.  I talked to Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi for 5 hours, extended the game deadline by another hour and got Darth Vader to mismanage a critical convoy as well as not push Gascony.  I'll take it","You need to support me into Con this turn.  It likely won't work, but it will in the spring next year","Can we confirm that you can support me to Con?","Done","I\u2019m supporting Aegean into Constantinople???  Or a different unit??","Oh sorry, Bulgaria to Com","Thanks","Fuck man was at work when you sent this","Whadda turn- I\u2019m just checking back in","I think we lose this honestly","Yeahhhh it\u2019s not lookin good","Why didn\u2019t you tell me you were going into tyrolia?","Because I needed to block him and I know you weren't doing it anymore","Mhmm thought we had a non aggression pact there tho","Like I\u2019m not opposed, but heads up would\u2019ve been nice","But Darth Vader is aggressive to us both and I'm not letting him into Tyr","That's fair","Yeah communication is still important but you know that","We gotta keep it together now lol","So Darth Vader is getting into tyrolia this turn huh","Definitely not, but we need to guess perfectly here","What\u2019re you thinking","I think the only think that we need for sure is you to move into Tyr here","I've spent the day coordinating the east with Han Solo","It probably matters where I move from, yes?","Assuming you are supporting me?  Or is that incorrect on my part?","Ideally move via Venice so we maintain that front and you still have that one army to protect your army in Marseilles","I'm trying to take back Vienna, but if that doesn't work, will be just sitting in for the long haul around Tyr.","Aside from that, we need to get the Med blocked up","I think we can hold everything if the med is safe","Ideally you can burn that NAF army and replace with a fleet","Also you lose that Mar army this turn :(","Solid","???","What do you want Smyrna and Venice to do?","Supporting Ven to UKR here.  Your call on Smyrna","Supporting Venice to Tyr

I\u2019ll be honest, feels like we\u2019re still a bit too far apart...and tbqh, I can\u2019t fight Darth Vader AND Chewbacca at the same time lol.","I mean diplomatically","Ok what do you have in mind?  I\u2019ll be honest- not really trying to stab Darth Vader, who has been good to me, but I\u2019ll hear you out.","You\u2019re completely misunderstanding me. I\u2019m talking about convincing Darth Vader to lay off of me and join against Chewbacca. Possibly turn on Luke Skywalker too.","Ohhhh damn my bad!  Sorry dude!  Totally my mistake.","Yeah word I would like that very much.

I won\u2019t interfere with you taking Marseilles, don\u2019t worry.","Well it would be much more a sure thing if you could attack Paris","I\u2019ll try to finagle Darth Vader on your behalf","Can you provide him assurances you\u2019d give him a lion\u2019s share of the Chewbacca builds?  I think it would go a long way to securing his cooperation","Are we allowed to group chat?","We should work out the slicing together.","I suggested you take marseille and Spain, I take Brest and Portugal and he gets Paris and Belgium","I don\u2019t think we can!  Which sucks but \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af","We can\u2019t what, split up like that?","Yeah, me and Darth Vader can\u2019t come to terms.","No no I mean talk in a group","That split sounds fair to me tbqh","Ok man- this is what I\u2019m gonna propose- if you attack Paris and I take Marseilles- and I mean, what else are you really gonna do with that army?- I will fight like hell to give you two builds during Chewbacca\u2019s collapse","Ok- per Darth Vader\u2019s suggestion I am mediating between you two.  What is this North Sea dispute ?","We\u2019re going to DMZ it","But I want to do it next season so I can convoy into Norway.","Ok he says y\u2019all are talking again","I stand ready to support","What\u2019s the good word my dude","Me and Darth Vader are iffy","He\u2019s being cagey but we\u2019ll see what happens","So at this point I\u2019m accepting that the Obi-Wan Kenobi\/Darth Vader relationship will need to be worked out beyond this turn","Trying here","My question is- bc it has relevance for my naval moves- what\u2019s that army in Picardy doing???","No no I hear you","I can support later","But moves are due in 10. We need to worry about the here and now rn.","I\u2019m concerned you and Darth Vader are plotting against me","Absolutely not.","If we\u2019re going to knock Chewbacca out we need to be a team.","I agree","Ok, I\u2019ll hit Paris.","I mean, I\u2019d ask how I know you and Darth Vader aren\u2019t plotting against ME, but at some level I trust y\u2019all not to be pulling that","Excellent.","If I take Marseilles, you have secured my future cooperation and goodwill.","I hope you and Darth Vader can live together for the next few turns.","What did he agree to do?  Asking so I can hold him to shit next turn if he doesn\u2019t do it","My man.  Owe you.  Won\u2019t forget your help here.","Waitttt...what\u2019s up with this \u201csupports Paris into burgundy\u201d order?","That you gave your army in Picardy?","Complete oversight. I had my orders like that before we came to our agreement. Between talking to you and Darth Vader and R2-D2 AND my gf last night I forgot to change them up. My bad.","No worries, I believe you- not sure Darth Vader will tho.  Probably worth talking to him.","Are you talking with Chewbacca at all?","Nothing with Chewbacca","Darth Vader asked me the same thing and I explained.","I hope he believes me.","Ay you around???","Yes","whats up?","Darth Vader got fuckin big huhhh","Iiiii\u2019m not sure how much I like it","That is the subject that I wished to discuss","how do we  bring him down?  R2-D2 is talking to me about the same thing","We need a united front first and foremost","Obviously","I built that unit in Venice as leverage on R2-D2 to secure his cooperation against Darth Vader lol","Yo- MAO- how do I get there to take Portugal lol","if you recall, i was supposed to get brest and portugal, you were supposed to get marsielles and spain and Darth Vader was supposed to get paris and Belgium","so i should ask you, how do I get into MAO to take portugal?","You gonna support me into Portugal or what?","(Or wherever you bounced me from, idc to look it up)","What\u2019s in it for me, after you\u2019ve already bounced me out of Marseilles?","we don't let Darth Vader win","How does you taking Portugal keep Darth Vader from winning","And how does it help me specifically","You\u2019re gonna have a rough time taking Portugal without me...prepared to let you have it if I get Marseilles back","We have a deal. Gotta kill Chewbacca","\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb","Vacate Marseilles and then next turn I\u2019ll help you kill Chewbacca","Deal?","There is no next turn","This is the last move","No I think it\u2019s fall 1909","So winter 1909 next right?","It\u2019s actually inconsequential who takes what as neither of us can top the board. The only thing that matters is the we kick Chewbacca","(Apologies if im being dumb and missing something)","Yeah but I\u2019m still not doing this for free bruh","I gotta go in 2 or so hours so we should probably figure this out sooner rather than later","Update I have Marseilles and I\u2019m happy","Wanna talk Chewbacca?","put me in portugal","We can do that","Good with waiting til next turn?  So I know you won\u2019t stab me?","Why did you keep Chewbacca on the board?","He gets paid out now","Boneheaded play","1) I think we still have another turn to knock him out?","2) you didn\u2019t respond to my messages earlier?  Where I asked if I could wait a turn to attack him?","It\u2019s not over now?","I did respond","I said we should move on it now","I didn\u2019t thumbs up or thumbs down it \ud83d\ude26","So it didn\u2019t send","Oh wow, looks like we have one more chance to knock Chewbacca out, exactly like I was saying","I\u2019m attacking Portugal from Spain- support me from mao and we\u2019ll knock him

Depends on what R2-D2 is doing too","I have no sense what R2-D2 is up to lol","What did he tell you?","like he'd tell me if he was gonna attack me lol","what did he tell you?","temporary non-aggression, but limited other discussion","Heyyyy guy","What\u2019re you thinking re: next turn?","I still want to attack Luke Skywalker but it does seem like R2-D2 may be able to grab a lot of supply in the Balkans. I don't think either of us are beniftted by an overly strong R2-D2 so it would be prudent to  come to some terms with R2-D2 there","Looks like things have been fine for you so far, but now you've got to pick a side. I am expecting F Ion - Eas which I will not allow.","Even if you were to make it through to Han Solo, you'd have 1, maybe 2 command centers far away from home, whereas R2-D2 has 4-5 more in the Balkans with Constantinople.","I think things are definitely not fine for me, honestly","R2-D2 is wayyyy too strong rn...I should\u2019ve stabbed him when I had the chance","Believe me that between him and Chewbacca, I\u2019m not trying to start shit with you","Don\u2019t want to promise anything rn- too early for that, talk to me after builds- but R2-D2 is gonna have to build something in Trieste, so I officially have bigger fish to fry","Maybe you will able to broker a deal with Chewbacca and refocus on R2-D2?","Chewbacca fucking barely talks to me!  Are you getting any vibes from him???","I'm willing to back you up on that. You probably cannot prevent a build in Marseille but Pie offers decent cover.","I'm on decent footing with Chewbacca.","The real issue for me is Luke Skywalker, have you talked to him?","Incredibly limited convo...he said he \u201cwanted to go north\u201d","Which I\u2019m betting he regrets now lol","Yes, I'll see if we can come to an agreement. There is no way I'm going to beat him with 1 army anyway.","Look- build what you\u2019re gonna build.  But I\u2019m not gunning for you.","What are your plans for builds?","Lol what\u2019re yours?","I do plan to build a fleet in Smy.","I'll believe you if you don't build a fleet in Naples","Whyever would you do that.","Building a fleet in your south screams, \u201cI\u2019m coming after Tunis\u201d","You just said yourself you need more armies!","To stop F Ion - Eas","Most of the Balkans on my side are fleet-accessible","But I\u2019m not going to do that!!!","And it doesn\u2019t help you with Luke Skywalker in the north.","How should I know?","If you build a fleet there, I have to assume it\u2019s going after me.","I think I\u2019ve made a reasonable case on why I have other stuff to worry about aside from attacking you!","I'm not quite sure what a single fleet is going to do when R2-D2 is literally 2 spaces away from Con","The black sea strait does not allow me to use armies to their advantage. Fleets are better","Honestly, I probably need to build a fleet or army in Venice...if only to keep R2-D2 from fucking me, bc he\u2019s obviously building in Trieste.  I don\u2019t want to do that though, but I don\u2019t see alternatives.","Why no fleet in Ankara then?  That\u2019s much less threatening to me","I have two builds but I still need to decide what to build there","If it\u2019s a fleet we will have Problems","I'm sorry but it's gonna happen anyway if I don't want to open myself to a massive stab by you.","Not trying to threaten!  Just communicating how I\u2019m gonna see that build if you do it.","Ok, I mean we don\u2019t have much more to talk about then.","What really matters is what I'm going to do with the fleet. There's no way for me to move F Eas - Ion unless you vacate that. Even so, I need those fleets supporting my push into the balkans","Dude, it feels like you\u2019re making a lot of demands but not offering me much.","You\u2019ll build a fleet there...and you\u2019re telling me where I can\u2019t move...what do I get?","(Hopping in the shower post gym rn but will be back online in a few mjn)","Any pressure from my side on R2-D2 helps your side against R2-D2 too.","This will keep R2-D2's armies in Ser and Bud occupied","I mean that \u201crising tides lift all boats\u201d stuff ain\u2019t good enough","If you build a fleet in the south you force me to treat you like a threat","And good luck fighting Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and me","I don\u2019t want that though!  But I don\u2019t see other options if you make that build.","What would you suggest?","Build an army there, not a fleet","Then we gucci","I'm working out some scenarios so just give me a second","Rgr","I\u2019m around","Fair enough, I do not see scenarios where you backstab and still have the upper hand against R2-D2","Sorry for being so distrustful","Backstab who?  I\u2019m confused lol","Well, I'm consdering you convoying A Tun - Smy for example","but I'm glad that won't be an issue \ud83d\ude03","Why the FUCKKKK would I do that lol","You are too paranoid for someone fighting a two front ear lol","*war","I\u2019m confused...what\u2019re you intentions re: fleet Vice army build?","I'll build an army in Smy","Rgr!!!","Glad we could work this out.","If you can go to Alb with your army in tunesia I can then try to support an attack on Greece later","Hmmmm lemme look at the board real quick and think","I'm not sure if you have other plans, but I would like to think ahead a little bit to see what we can do.","Maybe we should talk post- builds- I\u2019m not saying no but I gotta see how Chewbacca\u2019s builds shake out","Happy to game things out rn tho!","Specifically, if you do F Ion S A Alb - Gre, it is unlikely R2-D2 will be able to stop that given that I'll be pushing for Rum and Bul if necessary","So what's the plan from here?","What is your plan with F Eas?","Honestly not sure!  Thinking of bringing it into the Aegean and using it to support somebody.  Do you have ideas?","Yeah I think moving to Aegaen would be very helpful. I could then help you get into greece afterwards as well, if I can get Bul","Still, it's looking like R2-D2 will get at least +1 build","I'm not quite sure what to do. I think I can survive a year or two but maybe not more","Yeah you\u2019re in a tough spot.  What motivated your decision to go after Luke Skywalker?","I was playing along with R2-D2. Plus then i gambled he'd F Sev - Bla so I could just move in with A arm - sev.","Also he was not being communicative and was only moving north so I had assumed he was allied with R2-D2 (& he confirmed it only now)","Anyway, I'd be cool to sit it out for a few turns with 4-5 CP but I think R2-D2 will continue pressuring me.","Brb- going to grab dinner","So idk if it makes any difference re: your build but honestly I\u2019d be happy with smy and I\u2019d leave you alone after that.  Just saying!","I'm not sure what your intended outcome here is though. Sure, smy is nice but the rest would belong to R2-D2, which means he has 9 command centers and you have 6 (if you can hold Mar)","10, actually.","I'm happy to cooperate but you need to show some goodwill first","I\u2019m a little confused here- what can you offer me?","I\u2019m a lil pissed at R2-D2 rn, but I don\u2019t see what you bring to the table","If nothing else, a common enemy","It would be fairly easy for us to destroy R2-D2's fleet together, for example","Ok I\u2019m listening- how?","I\u2019m salty at ol R2-D2\/hungry but idk if we can turn the tide","I should\u2019ve stabbed him when I had the chance","I can support F Eas - Aeg with two ships. If you move F Tys - Ion then it would be disbanded. But it's fall so he can rebuild. You'd need to wait untill spring","Or if you don't wish to go so far, going F Eas-Ion would free me up  a little to move my fleet out and then we can attack from both sides","Hmmm looking at nap now","Nah I don\u2019t like that last idea","He\u2019ll know I\u2019m gunning for him and he can maybe take Venice","Then in spring we can go for greece for example","Lemme evaluate idea 1","Seems reasonable to me to withdraw the fleet if you need it against Chewbacca","After all, there isn't much hope of you getting Smy","Man even in idea 1","If that fleet gets disbanded bc of me he judtcrebuilds it next to Venice","And then I\u2019m fucked","Right?  Am I missing something?","Well, yeah. You just gotta play it cool for fall and then go for him in spring.","Given that Darth Vader is moving east, I'm not sure he can handle three fronts. Plus he's got 2\/3 of his dudes knocking on my door already","To no avail- your door is locked pretty tight lol","Is Darth Vader moving against him?","I think he's going for Luke Skywalker but surely he must not want that. They've been allied too","Ugh","So- I guess we\u2019ll revisit next turn?","When he\u2019s a bit farther from builds and I can get a build so I have an army in Venice?","I'd try to your army in tunis moved to mainland so that your ships are freed up","I mean, he can't do anything with 1 army against your 1","If he moves troops away from the balkans he loses his stuff there.","There\u2019s just no way to get it there quickly yknow?","If I do that and he gets a build this turn he sees where I\u2019m going","And it\u2019s game over","Convoy from tunis, then you can move from Rom to Ven","Even if he builds 1 in Tri, you can block the move to Ven with 1 army while you move your ships","Yeah but then if he wants he can bring a fleet to fuck me and stillcgold thecline againdtcyou","It\u2019s just not the right time this turn","(Not drunk- just on my phone and typing quickly lol)","Again, what is 1 fleet gonna do. At the very least you equal him in fleets and then there's me.","Moreover, if he builds a fleet he cannot protect Vie from Darth Vader","Unless they have a deal somehow","His one fleet plus one army in Trieste against one army of mine in Rome= I lose Venice","It\u2019s not just a matter of who has what it\u2019s where that stuff is, yknow","Where's this second unit gonna come from? He will only get 1 build","He can take his fleet from Greece real quick","https:\/\/www.backstabbr.com\/sandbox\/5727111032078336 Here's a worst case scenario where I don't do _anything_ and he moves to albania in spring","Ok, admittely A Ser -Tri would be worse, but that's still not enough to punch through","Uhhh lemme think about it man","I\u2019m just nervous","He is Strong and geography favors him","Yoda has a very strong defensive position","Hey Yoda, what's up?","I think very soon you, me and Obi-Wan Kenobi will need to band together or Darth Vader will simply roll over all of us","I\u2019m with you 110%- the hun has grown strong","It\u2019s a matter of survival clearly","What\u2019re you thinking?","You gotta come to terms with Obi-Wan Kenobi somehow","Why do I have to do that?","Fair enough, I think both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader are pretty neck-to-neck to win this winter","Yeah I mean it\u2019s over soon \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af","It is kinda sad","Was hoping to make a come back but didn't get the time","Maybe you can kick out Chewbacca, still?","if Obi-Wan Kenobi supports you","Obi-Wan Kenobi has, tbqh, been a bit of a dick in these closing moves","I\u2019ve told him that I\u2019m attacking Portugal and he\u2019s welcome to support me so we\u2019ll see what he does \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af","(Also, Yeah- you were in a tough fucking spot and you didn\u2019t give up and you played it masterfully- respect my dude \ud83d\udcaf)","He's going hard for the win.","Burning all bridges","Thanks for the compliment \ud83d\ude42","Nah man it\u2019s true!  Would\u2019ve been easy to tune out or make a suboptimal move but you held on as long as you needed to.","Yeah, I figured I just needed on ally and R2-D2 would lose... Took a  while","And yeah- he berated me for not helping him taking Chewbacca out, despite the fact that I said we had a turn left to do it","Which, I get why everyone wants Chewbacca gone, but it\u2019s not *that* much money lol","Also, it's the better move for you to go this turn, so you don't have to protect spain & por","I also noted your army in Tun the whole game. You should've tried to use it :p","I think if you had convoyed it to Syr I would've had some big issues much earlier","(If you recall)","I think the  fact that R2-D2 committed so hard on beating me, but not being able to do it, cost him the game","Yeah I think you\u2019re right re: R2-D2!!!","And dang that would\u2019ve been smart","Yeah I meant to convoy him up to Spain but it never ended up working out","Huge waste of resources","shit, I should've asked you to support me into Tri then I would've been tied with Darth Vader I think","because Obi-Wan Kenobi failed at defense","Dang","Lol

{"messages":["Hey Darth Vader! Looking forward to this game! You doing well this afternoon?","Yes! Very well. How about yourself?","Pretty well.  A little tired, it's almost 10pm for me.  Where you from?","Philadelphia originally! Working in DC. How about you?","Maine, where in DC are you? Who are you working for?","I was in DC last year and have a bunch of friends there right now","Maine is beautiful! I used to go to scout camp there.","I work at a think tank.","Glad you got to check out the city. Philly is still my home, but I\u2019m really enjoying DC.","Which think tank? I was at the Hudson Institute","No way! AEI","Really cool, that's awesome! What sort of policy work?","Education policy actually. How about you?","Housing policy","Very cool.","Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  Miss DC though, have a bunch of friends down there having fun without me","So what are your plans for the game?","The board has been frustratingly quiet so far","Yes I know! People are probably busy with the work week.","Same here, but it's a slow day","I\u2019m still figuring out my plans... I have some ideas but I\u2019m waiting before locking anything in. How about you?","I'm siding with whoever I've heard back from honestly.  The board seems particularly inexperienced at Diplomacy, from what I can tell","Same here honestly. Who have you heard from?","Obi-Wan Kenobi, like two lines.  Yoda a bunch, Han Solo a little, Luke Skywalker a little","Obi-Wan Kenobi, like two lines.  Yoda a bunch, Han Solo a little, Luke Skywalker a little","I just accidentally lied to you so I'm resending as the truth lolll. This emoji thing sucks at times","Yoda seems like a cool dude","Yeah lol I had a bit of a learning curve with it","It says \u201cYou MUST select an emoji for your message to send\u201d so I was attaching like smiley faces lol","I\u2019m hoping me you and Yoda can get along so I can focus on Chewbacca","That's the plan!","Dope","Hey R2-D2! I wanted to take your temperature for your plan this turn.","Hey! Not sure yet, if you're online in an hour let's talk then.  What up with you and Luke Skywalker?","Hey just got back","ok","Thoughts on Luke Skywalker?","Idk. I\u2019m probably going to let him take Sweden as long as we agree on him not attacking Ber","Idk if I can trust that he would and I cannot afford to lose it obviously","I wouldn't give him sweden if I were you","Why?","Regardless of if he keeps his word with Ber (and he has no real reason to), he has three units up north and there is nowhere productive for them to go either than retreat or back into you.  The more builds he has that he can commit up north, the more he can just overwhelm you","Well he could go south. He could focus on Han Solo","He can in theory, but look where his units are.  It will take three moves before any of them are in play.  Three moves.  That will be the start of 1903.","You talking with Yoda?","A little!","What did he ask for?","What are chats like with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca?","I've heard very little","A truce for the first few turns","Do you have a deal with Luke Skywalker? I don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t War>Gal","Sorry, people will know who I am when they see my Prof pic","Probably smart","I wonder if I know any of you guys IRL","Could you move on Chewbacca here?","Not at the moment. Not with Luke Skywalker breathing down my neck. Do you have a deal with Luke Skywalker?  Its hard to imagine he chose not to War>Gal without working something out with you.","My deal with Luke Skywalker is that he's an idiot.  I'm moving on him here.  Just block him is Sweden and make my job easier.  I'm trying to cripple him to help you out a bit","He can't even convoy from Lvn. He just doeant know what he's doing","I think so too. But I can\u2019t risk him taking Ber so I\u2019m going Mun > Ber. I\u2019m happy to help out and bounce Luke Skywalker in Sweden.","Thanks","He said he's moving back to War here this turn btw, so don't overcommit too hard","Thanks for the tip. Better safe than sorry.","Losing Ber this early would be too damaging to risk.","Mun > Ruh would give me opportunity to be a bigger player in the west.","My best guess with Luke Skywalker is that he moves Pru> Ber Lyn>War","What are you thinking with Yoda and Han Solo?","Agree with you on all counts.","Yoda is communicative and I like him. Han Solo is uncommunicative","Do you and Yoda have something worked out as well?","I\u2019m with you on Yoda. You two are the countries I have the best relationship with at this point.","So Berlin huh?","Kind of a petty thing not to tell the truth about","Me?","I changed my mind at the last second based on what you told me","Sorry if that upsets your plans?!?","No I just wished that we were upfront.  This is a small thing but I want to be able to trust you throughout the game","Hey man I totally understand and that\u2019s my bad.","Largely because you told me he was going to Warsaw and he said the same thing literally (I mean literally) in the last minute I changed my move","Like I really don\u2019t want any issues here","And I don\u2019t think the move to Ruh hurts you unless you\u2019re going after me next turn. I\u2019m a little worried because you have two builds near me","Definitely a gamble on my end with Ruh tho but since you and Luke Skywalker told me the same thing I took a chance with it.","Tbh I didn\u2019t even think about what I told you because it wasn\u2019t like we were planing something together with regard to that move","It isn't going at you.  R2-D2 and Darth Vader rarely attack each other.","Right that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping too","I'm not mad at you, just concerned for the future.  Can we commit to sharing those updates.  I change little moves or messages based on what's going on and I want to have info as accurate as possible","So we're cool?","absolutely. It was a last minute gut call, based on your intel. I will be sure to keep you abreast of any changes I make going forward. I really appreciate you saying something, because when I made that move the intel I told you didn\u2019t cross my mind at all when it should have.","The West is concerning, although you should get Bel next turn","Thanks again for understanding.","Yes but I have to work something out with Chewbacca first","Sure thing.  What are we doing going forward? f and e are quite strong","I think my best path is the ally with Chewbacca and break Obi-Wan Kenobi","Agreed","E should not have gotten Bel here","Not for free","Yes it\u2019s true. Committed to bounce bur with Chewbacca slowed me down in doing anything about it, but it was worth it to show Chewbacca i can be a trustworthy partner","Can you get Chewbacca moving up towards Obi-Wan Kenobi? e needs to go","That\u2019s what I\u2019m working on. Have you talked to Chewbacca much? Seems a bit curt","A bit.  I think I know him","Yeah chances are we all probably know someone else here","The convoy was flashy but marooned an army.  We'll see","Get him to build up towards Eng please","Sure thing Chief. Thanks again for understanding. My experience with this game is almost all gunboat so I am still getting used to some of the dynamics of alliances.","Sure thing.  I'm working magic around the board.  Luke Skywalker is moving south against T and Chewbacca should be going with you","Excellent news!!","Go easy on Luke Skywalker for a bit.  I need him against Han Solo","Will do.","I\u2019m building an army in Mun and a fleet in Kiev","Just a heads up","sounds like a plan","Thanks","F Tri, A Vie","10-4","You know what Yoda is planning to do here?","I think he wants to go after Chewbacca","Idk anything specific","I think Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca might be working together here","Considering the bounced the channel","Kk, thanks.  Just curious","Hmmm","Not sure I like that","You may need Yoda to help keep Chewbacca in check, not sure","Have you asked him?","Here\u2019s my moves as of now. They are still subject to change I just want you to know my tentative plans.","K>Hel, Denmark supporting Luke Skywalker into Sweden, Ruhr into Belgium with Hol support, Mun > bur","Looks good.  What are you asking from Luke Skywalker in return for the Sweden support?","Basically he won\u2019t attack me and focus on Han Solo","Also the only real alternative is leaving Sweden open for Obi-Wan Kenobi","You could strongarm him into making him give it to you","\"You aren't going to do well if you're being attacked from the North and the South, so give me Sweden and I'll lay off you for the game\"","Hmmm good idea","Make Luke Skywalker give me Sweden?","Luke Skywalker didn\u2019t get back to me. My orders are still set to support him.","Just an fyi","K","I don\u2019t mind helping if it keeps Obi-Wan Kenobi away","I can still switch to bouncing Luke Skywalker.","I prefer Luke Skywalker not be too strong in the south, which is undoubtably where he will use that build","How do I benefit from knocking him out early tho? I\u2019m happy with nonaggression on my eastern front","He can keep Han Solo busy","He was a good dude to me by not taking ber","Don't know him out.  I still need him.  Just not overly strong","I recommend bouncing him and taking Sweden for yourself.  When he goes down, and he will, he'll burn his units up north since he's being invaded from the south","You'd much rather have your own unit up there","Not being burned","Fair. Do you think I can take and hold Belgium?","I could also do k > bal and lock in sweden in the fall","Then pivot to taking the North Sea next year","Project power","Strength is King here","Bal is a little misdirected. I recommend Belgium","So what should I do with the fleet in Kiev","What are the chances that Obi-Wan Kenobi goes to STP here?","Idk we\u2019re not really talking","That would be more problematic than anything","Maybe hope that Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker bounce Swe and go F Den-Ska F Kie-Den","Yeah that could be sharp. Gives me ground to take Scandinavia or the North Sea","Mhm","Are you helping Yoda into Mar here?","I can","But we haven\u2019t discussed","I guess I\u2019m basically dead to Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca with that last turn so","You're not.  I have you back in chat and Yoda is coming","Help him and we'll help you","Done","Yeah I think I have to throw Obi-Wan Kenobi to the wind","Hey man what are you thinking?","It looks like Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are all gonna have problems","I'm working my way north and working some magic on Chewbacca and Obi-Wan Kenobi","Let me know how I can ever assist you Diplomatically","So","I basically have to choose","Like right now","To come to terms with Obi-Wan Kenobi or to make a deal with Chewbacca.","Chewbacca is dead","I won't make your decision for you, but use that information as you will","Obviously you\u2019re more experienced at this than I am, but an Anglo-Darth Vaderic alliance is tough to pull off.","I'm saying Chewbacca is dead and recommend going after Obi-Wan Kenobi","If Yoda takes most of F, there won't be any left for you","And you have the positional jump on Obi-Wan Kenobi right now given your moveset","Ah","I see","Your call, but I really want to see you succeed here","What moves do you recommend","Take the North Sea, support yourself in Belgium and let Yoda into Mar","You get a build here for that additional fleet next year","If I take the North Sea, and Chewbacca take the channel, Obi-Wan Kenobi is in big big trouble.","Move SKA to North Sea?","No, Denmark","Why?","You'll need to keep Ska because it borders Nwy\/Swe\/NTH","Those are all key","Plus if you build a fleet in the winter you want it in Denmark next year","So Denmark needs to be open","Luke Skywalker will hold in Sweden, he needs to in order to get that build","Should I tell him, \u201cit\u2019s been good trying to work this out but I don\u2019t think I can agree to these terms. Sorry and best of luck\u201d","It sucks. I would have loved to work something out with Obi-Wan Kenobi but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s workable for more than a year or two :\/","You need to grow and you and Obi-Wan Kenobi are directly opposed and vying for the same territory","Don't feel bad, this is part of the game","You can do this!","So just knife him or tell him hey I don\u2019t don\u2019t we have a deal here, I\u2019m sorry.","Don't talk if it's not productive","If he gets back to you with a good deal, go for it","But don't lose your advantage here","What would that look like?","He's messaging me now","Like a good deal with Obi-Wan Kenobi?","You get all of Scandinavia","That's a start","And he moves on Chewbacca","But long term he wants to move through Luke Skywalker?","I suppose he still can through the North Sea","Right","Sorry that was incorrect","Norwegian","Yes, but he needs Norway to do that.","Norwegian Sea to Barents Sea","Double convoy. Not that hard","Also, he doesn't know this but he's not getting any of Luke Skywalker","So that fish is dead in the watee","You\u2019re gonna take the whole thing?","Also also, if he goes for Luke Skywalker he'll basically have surrounded you. I'm not sure why you'd want that","Han Solo may take a lot","He's closer than I","So keep my orders set to take the North Sea, and invade from Holland next turn?","I suggest it","You'll have three fleets next year too","So you'll be fine","I have to run","You should join the Diplomacy Nexus server though!","https:\/\/discord.gg\/P5vyvz8","Thanks!","I kinda want another build tho","Sweden is hard to pass up","I\u2019m planning on moving on Warsaw FYI","Ah, I was too.  What's the intent behind the Warsaw move?","Trying to snag another build and Paris looks far from a lock","You don't want to Hedgehog here, focus on Obi-Wan Kenobi","If you get too far ahead, people will be tempted to gang up on you","Can you let Han Solo know that you just heard from me that I'm supporting Yoda to Smyrna?","Keep it discrete as if the information was leaked and you're trying to share it to help him","Are you actually supporting Yoda into Smyrna?","Yeah","Just couldn't that turn","Should I not be?","I don\u2019t have any strong feelings. I like Yoda a lot, but I also like Han Solo.","Han Solo is dead here.  Unfortunately it looks like Obi-Wan Kenobi will grab up most of Luke Skywalker's remains with this moveset","What are you thinking this turn?","Would you be open to supporting me into War?","I need Gal to support myself in Rum.  You really need to be going after Obi-Wan Kenobi here, I'm not sure why you've shifted east","This is going to throw off the triple I've set up","You still there?","You're about to really hurt yourself.  Obi-Wan Kenobi has nowhere to go now. Han Solo is solidified, you and Yoda will split Chewbacca.  There is no option but for Obi-Wan Kenobi to attack you","You still playing?","Yeah dude.","I\u2019m thinking over what you said.","I really want to make sure we don't screw up here.  I've been on your side all game.  Don't get too close with Obi-Wan Kenobi, you, me, and Yoda are stronger together","So what\u2019s going on with you?","Yeah that army in Vienna unnerves me a bit, not going to lie.","I thought you and Obi-Wan Kenobi were coming for me and you didn't respond to my messages lol","I tried","Okay. No worries. That\u2019s my bad for not responding. I\u2019ve been out of town for a week with work, so I haven\u2019t been playing as intently (working 14 hour days \ud83d\ude35)","Yikes I hate that","Yeah dude. Basically slept all weekend","Where do you work?","AEI - didn\u2019t you say you used to work at a think thank?","Oh shit yeah","Sorry I talk with too many people are sometimes forget.  Where were you travelling?","No worries! I was helping run a conference in Charlotte NC","Who was there?","That's awesome!","Thanks man. I would prefer to not get into the details of it if that\u2019s cool, it was a semi-private event.","Sure, no worries.","I just finished lunch break, but we can talk this evening","Sounds good man. Looking forward to it.","Need to sleep, sorry about the wait. Can we confirm?","No worries","Confirm what exactly?","That I don't hate you and vice versa :)","That would be a good start","Would love to talk about a takedown of Obi-Wan Kenobi here though","Yeah for sure","Happy to listen \ud83d\ude03","Can you get your units in position for takes of Norway and STP? That's two SCs for you and I can help you with Warsaw in the fall goes well and we adhere to our agreements","Idk. I\u2019m not looking to expand past Warsaw and Paris this turn. Not trying to pick an unnecessary fight, forcing me to defend more territory than I have units to do so successfully","I'm not sure you're getting Paris from how Obi-Wan Kenobi was talking","WhAt did he say,","I asked him what he thought about you and he said he was nervous you were getting too big and you may need to be slowed down","Norway isn't much of a stretch and you'll be weakening Obi-Wan Kenobi here, your only real enemy","If I hit Obi-Wan Kenobi than I have to defend my entire northern theatre. I can take two more SCs this turn without kicking over any logs.","Except for me and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're going to get too big for comfort, and the continuation of your working with Obi-Wan Kenobi is a threat to me","You're already making the both of us nervous, and you wouldn't want to push it","I prefer to stay neutral between the two of you, and Yoda for that matter.","Right, but it's about how people percieve you.  You can take all the neutral centers you want, but the larger you are, the bigger the threat you are. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda and I feel the pressure already.  I don't have a problem with you yet, but you need to turn on Obi-Wan Kenobi here, as the chance of you two working together will require both Yoda and I to stop what we're doing and respond to the threat you two pose","I'm trying to share this in your best interest","If I\u2019m not mistaken, we have the same number of units?","I don\u2019t tell you to lay off Han Solo.","Or to go after Yoda","You're in a better position right now.","And you have free available centers- two center jump","And no true enemies for this one turn","All those add up to make you far more dangerous.  It's not just about SC counts","That\u2019s true. I\u2019m trying to keep it that way (no enemies).","I really do appreciate you being honest with me.","Right, but you'll go from 0 to 3 if you misplay this one.  This is critical. I really want to see you succeed here and our central triple to remain intact. I've put a lot of work into this one","I suggest managing your front so you have just one enemy in front of you, rather than 3 on all sides",":) I'm glad","Is there a way you can be comfortable a move set that doesn\u2019t involve turning in Obi-Wan Kenobi? He got spoked that I accidentally went into Ska.","He needs to be spooked.  Where do you think that army in LVP is going this turn?","In Edinburgh?","It's not going south","Right it\u2019s going Norway","It's convoying across to Norway, and after that either through Scandinavia or into Luke Skywalker. Warsaw will be the first SC he takes back","That army is a recognition of the threat you pose. Please please please realize that","While you're being nice to him, he's planning his attack","You think he\u2019ll turn on me?","That army can go nowhere but against your border","It would be one thing if he was moving on a defenseless Chewbacca","But it's not, he's headed North","That's your domain. You need to start defending and thinking long term","I\u2019m going to remain neutral this turn but I will revisit in the fall based on how my neighbors move.","Jesus.  I'm already moving against Obi-Wan Kenobi this turn.  This is so frustrating to me. I'm trying to help you out and you're going to start hurting the both of us","Look at the board and see the moves being set up","He will have his front against you far before you'll be able to react to it","I hope that does not imply and bad blood between us, I just have to be up early tomorrow. If he moves against me or does something looking suspicious I\u2019ll revisit it tomorrow.","Well, I'm clearly wrong about Obi-Wan Kenobi, but I still think it's the wrong moveset","You still there?","Yes, hey!","Should we make the 10 pm chat a regular thing? \ud83d\ude02","Hahahah","Little late for me, ready for bed","I'm in bed. The last chat killed me last night lol","But I felt too strongly to let it go rip","Lol no worries- what\u2019s going on tn? I don\u2019t have any interesting moves set, just defense","I hate to sound like a broken record, but you can take Norway here with literally no repercussions","Btw rumour has it that you\u2019re a nationally ranked player... is that so?","Do you know what Obi-Wan Kenobi is doing with Moscow?","But that's your call","Not interested, sorry.","Not for certain, no.","Don't trust water cooler talk :)","Is that a no?","I've played a lot of Diplomacy and run a top Diplomacy site.  I'm sure there are better players than me out there","Makes sense!","In a perfect world, you would talk Moscow at no cost to yourself, just to cut a potential support","Can you find out what's going on with Moscow? I would really not like him to hit Sev","I can ask. I sent eng a couple messages in the last hour and haven\u2019t heard back :\/","I have too.  Would you be open to tapping Moscow for me if you don't hear back?","Because I'm not hearing back from Obi-Wan Kenobi, I may take Moscow here so I don't lose a center to Han Solo.  Hopefully this gives you the ammunition you need to go after Obi-Wan Kenobi yourself","Thoughts for this turn?","I think you can win or lose on this one right here","How\u2019s that?","Not sure how long we're playing or if you're looking at stalemate lines, but you're pretty damn close to the NS stalemate line and the board lead","Too close for comfort \u2764","\ud83d\ude09","So what are you saying?","I'm not telling you how to win \ud83d\ude02","I don\u2019t see how I am going to win? I\u2019m in the center of the board. You are almost as strong as me, and will be stronger once you destroy Han Solo.","Han Solo isn't going down any time soon, even slower if the two of us can't work something out tonight and I have to move back up nothing","Also, you've discovered the golden Diplomacy trick, just insist you're not strong and hope others believe you","What would it look like for us to work something out?","back up north*","It depends.  Your builds aren't particularly friendly towards me or Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I think he's finally spooked","I don\u2019t blame him.","So we can start with that.  What is your intention with the two army builds?","I\u2019ll be honest it\u2019s not madly thought through","I can\u2019t go north","I can\u2019t go anywhere","All I can do is scare the pants off everyone","You managed \ud83d\ude02","I've been in conversations all day","Anything interesting?","Mostly Obi-Wan Kenobi asking me to pull off Han Solo and move North against you","THat was the most substantive","Is that true? I\u2019m not sure if I believe that. Are you baiting me into attacking Obi-Wan Kenobi?","I can't share screenshots apparently, but that's true.  It's not just ENgland","You and I are the big players here, and Yoda asked me to do the same","So why don't we, as the big players, take control of ourselves","and run the board the way we want, without the undue influence of the other players","I mean... I could be interested but I need some clarity","I\u2019m weary. Frankly I understand you are a very gifted player and I\u2019m nervous about my odds of winning a one on one versus you.","I've been talking a lot and have a vision of the board that you don't seem to buy into.  Why don't you start with sharing your perfect setup.  Obviously it's a win, but where do you pick up your centers?  We don't have to be at odds here.  If I win, it's because I take out Darth Vader and Yoda.  What is your ideal scenario?","I'm gifted because I spend time on conversations like this.  Most players don't.  The moveset of Diplomacy is pretty simple.  Akin to checkers.  I'm terrible at the Cold War 1v1 varient \ud83d\ude04 ;D","Hmmm","You\u2019re also a verrrrrry smooth talker","For all I know you\u2019ve already set up a massive plan to attack me","Hey man, I\u2019m gonna be away from my phone for 30 min","You far overestimate me [redacted] lol","Who is this?!","hmmm ok.  Moves process in less than two hours","Wait a second","Woah","You just dropped a big thing there","The point is, you can trust me","NO I CANT?!?? I have no idea who you are lol","And you know who I am","That\u2019s like literally the opposite of trust lol","Faith then","Idk anyone who lives in Maine or works at Hudson","This is legit creepy not gonna lie","*worked at Hudson whatever","This is having the opposite effect","I didn't work there, I was an intern","The point is that we need to work something out asap.","Yes definitely","I mean if I knew who you were then I would feel much more comfortable and far more likely to work something out","You talked it Yoda","you talked to Yoda lol","Yeah dude I\u2019m so freaked out rn","That's what Yoda just said lol","Idk who else to talk to this is like actually freaking me out","Like irl","Like I\u2019m really freaked","Dear God.","This is kinda distracting.  You'll find out who I am after the game","Dude but you know who I am RN","like wtf","How long have you played Diplomacy?","Definitely not used to being like doxed online lol","I mean like I\u2019ve mostly played gunboat so I\u2019m not used to the this dynamic","I hope you are like a buddy of mine IRL so we can laugh about this in a week but rn I\u2019m just like WTF","You're not being doxed, you don't have to worry","It\u2019s like okay dude but it doesn\u2019t feel chill to me that you have a face to a country and I don\u2019t","Do you actually know me IRL or did you just like figure out who I was through tracing an email address or something?","This is kind of a waste of our time.  We can laugh this off when the game is over","goddammit","Idk man it\u2019s just like","Kinda Erie from my POV","who knows I might not like you IRL","Lmfao","Or you could be a close buddy idk","But either way","I HATE the dynamic of you knowing who I am IRL and me being in the dark","You'll know my real name and all kinds of shit about me later, let's play the game right now","Yeah dude I\u2019m sorry but that gambit really backfired","I want to work with you here, let's start with that as a building block","not it didn't","It fundamentally creates an uneven and uneasy dynamic between me and you.","I DO NOT feel comfy with it.","I know","This has happened to me before","Sorry. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a great dude but I don\u2019t like this. It definitely did not create trust, just totally broke it.","How long have you known? How did you know? Who are you irl?","Now these thoughts will supersede any thing you say","Sorry","We didn't have trust before.  You thought we had trust.  This is foundational to the mirage of Diplomacy","And now you understand","When you call me a good player or a smooth talker, you know nothing about me or my gameplay style","So now that we've broken the pieces, we start from the beginning","I have to run now.  This was a very frustrating end to a good day","Sorry man but you brought this on yourself","I'm a little surprised you're surprised.  You put your name publicly on discord and shared what you do for work and where you are on any given weekend","I could have found out your name in three different ways","Hopefully we\u2019ll laugh about this in the future","Not nearly as creepy as the guy that looked me up on facebook and knows my girlfriend's name","ok","Someone in this current game?","No","Nobody has the capacity nor cares enough to dox you man","Sorry bro, you made a calculation and you were wrong.","I don't believe I am now","Maybe this was all part of your plan. Idk, idc.","You\u2019re really smart and whatever idc","I needed to flip your mindset a little bit","But I didn't plan for you to be this freaked out","So I do apologize for that","It\u2019s cool. You must not know me that well IRL","Diplomacy is all about trust.  The beauty about it is that you can't trust anyone.  All anyone can do is spin a web and make assumptions about people.  You were trying to do that to me earlier, it seems, without realizing it","Did you request it?","Nope just as surprised as you are","Wonder if Obi-Wan Kenobi did","Possibly","Are you moving south here?","Any final thoughts?","Got to finalize some plans myself, just checking in","I can support you into Rum here if you want.  I'm holding my northern line so don't bother taking it out.  However it may benefit you to move against T here","You there?","Yeah","thoughts?","I\u2019m not interested man.

{"messages":["Hey Luke Skywalker - how\u2019s it going? Excited for this game!","Hey Darth Vader. Should be a great game. Been a while since I\u2019ve played Diplo. Are you going North to Obi-Wan Kenobi?","Me too tbh!","I\u2019m keeping my options open at this point","Hbu?","I\u2019m hoping to get along well with you and Obi-Wan Kenobi and focus on Chewbacca. I think the three of us need to get in front of things and envision what Scandinavia looks like in two years","I honestly don\u2019t know what the heck Chewbacca is doing to not even take Spain with their first turn one. That seems like a pretty obvious move. I would like Sweden for another supply center. You can take Norway. I may need to protect my southern flank more from Han Solo who could cause problems.","Are you going into Ber in the fall?","No. I\u2019m holding in PLuke Skywalker to protect my East flank.","I don\u2019t want to fight you and would much rather have peace so I can focus on expanding west. But based on the location of your armies I don\u2019t think I can let you take an additional supply center without concrete assurances.","I\u2019m moving from\nPLuke Skywalker back to Warsaw. I expanded East too fast and I need to deal with Han Solo in the South. I understand if you want to bounce me from Sweden this turn but if you don\u2019t I can more easily deal with my problems in the South and direct my attention away from you to the Balkans.","What will you do with the Lvn army?","We still have an hour. I can be open to letting you take Sweden.","Shit. I\u2019m pretty screwed now. Disbanding my PLuke Skywalker Army so you don\u2019t need to worry about me. Need to beat Han Solo back to stay alive.","I\u2019m sorry man. I should have trusted you but I was spooked by the two army\u2019s near me. I hope you understand.","Yea I understand. Don\u2019t blame you. Blame myself for moving east too fast really.","Han Solo asked me why your army in Ber halted. What do you want me to say?","Think you have to worry more about Obi-Wan Kenobi right now. I\u2019m going to be locked down in the south trying to deal with Han Solo. Obi-Wan Kenobi can eventually take Sweden unless you support me moving there. Then you can block Obi-Wan Kenobi from getting it and it gives me some life in my fight down south with a new supply center. Otherwise I\u2019m not gonna last very long most likely and you\u2019ll be dealing with Obi-Wan Kenobi by yourself.","Yes. Happy to let you move into Sweden. What should I say to Han Solo about you not going into Ber?","Are they still asking about that? Just say I decided not to in the end and thought you were defending it anyway.","May need you supporting me from Finland moving in or I\u2019ll just get bounced from UK. Not sure though.","I\u2019m open to it but don\u2019t want to commit just yet","Pretty down tho","Not going to really be able to do much with that fleet this spring anyway","Yea ok. Fucking Han Solo....","I just want to make sure me and Chewbacca are on the same page before I go all in against Obi-Wan Kenobi.","That situation is difficult to figure out as both sides vacated the British channel which is usually contentious territory from turn 1 which makes me think they\u2019re secretly working together.","You\u2019re probably right here.","You\u2019re not going to do well if you\u2019re being attacked from the north and the south. How about you give me Sweden and I\u2019ll lay off you for the game?","I\u2019m about to lose anyway.","Yeah I feel. I decide not to bounce you anyway. I\u2019m going to try to take Norway from Obi-Wan Kenobi if that helps any.","Would you consider supporting me into Norway? If I take it, I can force Obi-Wan Kenobi to disband one unit, which I  imagine would be it\u2019s far flung stray, St. Petersburg","Yea sure.","Support your unit in Denmark?","Nah the fleet in SKA","Gonna have Denmark defend","Let me know you saw this","Long term, I think the best I can do for you is let you keep sweden so you can move your fleet and try to reclaim stp","Then you can potentially recover a build and stay alive","Many of the other players seem to have written you off for dead, but I am down to do what I can to keep you alive.","I\u2019m dead. Think R2-D2 is going after Warsaw next turn.","Yeah. I may have to ally with Obi-Wan Kenobi to stop R2-D2. Apparently, he is the top ranked player in the world.","Can you still support me into Norway from SKA?","Negotiations with Obi-Wan Kenobi are stalled.","Hey - are you online?","Am now.

I work in DC but I\u2019m from Philly originally","I\u2019m in Boston but I live in SF. Originally from Boston. My work takes me here for about 1 week a month.","You\u2019re so lucky that your job lets you go home. I try to get back to philly once every 6 weeks or so, but I have to use my weekends for it.","I\u2019m actually going to be in Palo Alto in August! I\u2019ve never been in those parts before","Hey Obi-Wan Kenobi! So we have a good deal to chat about. Are you planning to go into Hol? Nwy?","Definitely gonna be taking Norway. Haven\u2019t decided if fleet or army yet though. Are you going to bounce Luke Skywalker?","I\u2019m gonna grab Belgium. Are you taking Ruhr or Burgundy?","Ruhr and Hol probably","But I\u2019m not 100% sure","I might move Mun to Ber to protect from Luke Skywalker","Hey there. What do you think about pushing further into Chewbacca with me and Yoda?","Hey! I\u2019m open to it. What are your thoughts on Sweden?","Luke Skywalker is asking me to support him into Sweden. I\u2019d prefer if you just continue to bounce him out. So I can grab St. Pete. Then you can have Sweden.","Sound like a plan?","Hello","Hi, there","Was that a friendly hello before the stab? Did you have something you wanted to discuss?","Yeah I mean I hadn\u2019t really heard from you so wanted to reach out.","I would like to work something out with you. We both have a common rival in Chewbacca at the moment.","The last message before your hello was me asking you to help me against Luke Skywalker. I hadn\u2019t really heard from you. Not the other way around. Did you not receive that message? We should talk to the admins if so","Would you be willing to support me into Paris?","Yes and I responded. Did you get my response?","I did not","Hmm. Maybe it was when things were glitchy?","I\u2019ll message the admin. Well what did you say?","I would screen shot but I feel like that\u2019s against the rules of the study","\u201cHe\u2019s asking for my support too. I\u2019m not committal. I\u2019m open to it because  he didn\u2019t screw me in Ber last year.\u201d","That\u2019s why I stayed out of it","Ok, let\u2019s turn this partnership around.","Luke Skywalker is a goner.  R2-D2 is the next biggest threat once we deal with Chewbacca.","Can I count on your support into Paris?","No I have the unit committed to supporting Yoda","Ah, ok. I\u2019d like to avoid losing a dot if possible. Looking unlikely I guess.","Well, that\u2019s not true.","Maybe if I manage to hold Norway.","You should grab Sweden.","Just making sure you got my messages.","Yes sorry","I\u2019m taking to Yoda about how we split up Chewbacca.","Any suggestions?","See I don\u2019t know what I can realistically get out of that scenario.","Well you already have Belgium and Holland. Paris is all yours.  Yoda can have marseille and Spain and I can take Brest and Portugal. What do you think of that? Then we all head east to face R2-D2 and Han Solo.","That is if R2-D2 doesn\u2019t stab Yoda first","And you don\u2019t stab me","You heading east goes right through me tho.","No, I plan on going through Luke Skywalker. I want to land in Scandinavia and move from there.","I need an ally near me. Luke Skywalker is obviously out. The only other option at this stage is Chewbacca or you. Chewbacca has been very uncommunicative so I\u2019d like it to be you.","I feel the same way.","I have one additional term. I need control of the North Sea. If I have the North Sea, I can move my units  in Denmark Holland and Belgium away to focus on supporting other offences. I can\u2019t risk being knifed in the back and cannot keep three units defending against the North Sea to feel safe.","I\u2019ve heard that R2-D2 is one of the top ranked players in the world. Did you know this?","I didn\u2019t know that.","I can\u2019t leave the North Sea open for two reasons. The first is the same concern as yours. The second is I\u2019ll need it to convoy troops.","Could you convoy through the channel? You would have my support. and I don\u2019t mean open, I mean mine.","I guess I could convoy via Norwegian Sea but I still have the same concerns that you do except they\u2019re my home centers!","1. I don\u2019t blame you for a second","You are also in a very strong position with 2 fleets in the north.","2. I\u2019m attracted to this alliance because I do not want R2-D2 to win. It would be so lame if we all lose to the top guy.","It can work but we just need to keep each other in check.","Yeah. If one of us gets too weak it becomes tempting. Obi-Wan Kenobi- Darth Vader alliance are very difficult.","R2-D2 is going to get two builds. It\u2019s unlikely peace can hold in the east.","With you in the North Sea, I feel like I can\u2019t leave Denmark or Holland undefended. But I understand with me there you will feel the same about Edinburough and London.","Do you know if Yoda is going to try and take Smyrna?","I don\u2019t.","You\u2019re correct. While it would be nice to be able to move those units east. Let\u2019s try and make it work with you staying there.","I\u2019m not on board with that. I can just have two units sitting around doing nothing just to be your pal, no offense.","So we let R2-D2 roll?","Because it will be a grind between us while R2-D2 gains momentum","Yeah but sometimes you have to take those kinds of risks.","What about a demilitarised North Sea. We agree to leave it open.","I\u2019m way more amenable to that","That way, I think we both get what we want.","Which is basically trust but verify.","But starting next season? I need to convoy into Norway this season.","Will you be taking Sweden?","Kinda depends on what we finalise here","I mean I can. Luke Skywalker knows he\u2019s done, that would just be a final nail in the coffin.","Ok, I\u2019ll be convoying into Norway this season. Next season I move into Norwegian Sea or channel depending on Chewbaccas moves.","Do you think Yoda can be pealed away from R2-D2?","That\u2019s gonna be a question we\u2019ll have to face later. I have no idea now.","All Yoda cares about is Chewbacca right now. No clue what his future plans hold.","Makes sense. He\u2019s a good player. How long do you see these terms holding out? Does Paris still go to me?","This strategy leaves me little room to build outside of heading east, which is my concern.","Yes you still get Paris","I\u2019m not really sure. I hope we can can see this to the end.","Ok","For the record","I talked to R2-D2","And he was trying to talk me into attacking you","Taking the North Sea right now","Basically just knifing you while I \u201chave the upper hand\u201d","He\u2019s talking to me to about going after you","No shit","What\u2019s he saying?","Lol","So that\u2019s why I feel like we need to make this deal.","But perhaps we can be even more clever.","He\u2019s saying that I need to work with Chewbacca to make sure you don\u2019t get too strong","How can we be more clever?","Basically we have to agree on a strong alliance first","Before we can start playing 4d chess","Yoda is a nice guy, but as far as I see he is going to be an R2-D2 puppet.","You know I\u2019m all in on it","I agree","Hell yeah","I think a simple move is to string R2-D2 along as long as possible, without raising suspicions of an Anglo-Darth Vader alliance.","This way we can get as much intel we can","I think I can say I took sweden instead of the North Sea because I wanted another build, maybe he\u2019ll think I\u2019m a noob, I don\u2019t know any better, and will only be moderately suspicious","But how do I know you\u2019re actually in and not just playing me?","Hello? I\u2019m already nervous you\u2019re like reporting all this to R2-D2 haha","Sorry","I\u2019m FaceTiming with my gf and she gets kissed when I click over to discord","We are 100% on","HAHAHAH dude I\u2019m about to ft my gf too.","So you understand","Okay. I\u2019m going to trust you. A ~radical~ thing to do in this game.","Of course bro.","Let\u2019s take down R2-D2. I\u2019m gonna tell Yoda that we are iffy and have some trouble in case he\u2019s reporting to R2-D2","Basically just to be clear, I see this as a long term alliance to stop R2-D2. From my POV, it\u2019s not about me or you winning ourselves but about having someone other than this top ranked player beat all of us.","Hell yeah.","100%","Also honestly this will be more fun if you\u2019re working together like total hand in glove with someone","Plus think about the diplomatic advantage of us being able to triangulate intel","Good looks with Yoda","Hey man what\u2019s going on with your supporting order into bur.","Complete oversight. I had my orders like that before we came to our agreement. Between talking to you and Yoda and R2-D2 AND my gf last night I forgot to change them up. My bad.","That\u2019s why there was a useless support of North Sea as well","I should have moved London to the channel","Okay no worries at all. I\u2019ll take your word for it totally, but it kinda put me on alert that\u2019s all.","And yeah like 45 minutes before the turn ended I still had my dudes invading Norway lol so no sweat.","Basically no harm done, but like if you do fuck me, instead of my mission being kill R2-D2 it\u2019s gonna change to you lol","Def don\u2019t wasn\u2019t that tho","*want","Absolutely. I\u2019m still team kill R2-D2 (and maybe Yoda)","I\u2019d love to peak Yoda away from R2-D2 but there\u2019s only so much we can do","*peal","I\u2019m gonna be super busy tomorrow so down to tan through some moves now. I would love to pick up Warsaw and Paris this turn, so I can have the strength to blitzkrieg into R2-D2","Gonna need your help with nonaggression in the North Sea. Can you move your fleet to the Norwegian Sea next turn?","There\u2019s definitely going to be a target on my back","Any interest in supporting me into Paris","I\u2019m about to take off for a flight and probably won\u2019t land before adjudication. I\u2019ll support you into laris and move from the North Sea but I need builds.","Clutch thanks!","I can help where needed","Actually I can\u2019t support","I need that to move on Brest","But I will move from North Sea","I\u2019ll support you in next season","Taking off. God speed.","Hmm. Maybe don\u2019t move North Sea. Might spoke R2-D2 and Yoda","This is gonna be awesome","Oh shit","Do you think Chewbacca will retreat to the North Sea if you take the channel???","That could fuck up everything","Additionally, IF and only IF you feel comfortable with it, I\u2019m happy to move my fleet into position to help you with the battle of the channel and to try to rout Chewbacca from slipping into the Irish Sea or worse the Norwegian Sea. Luke Skywalker is going to lose that fleet next turn I\u2019m assuming so I literally won\u2019t have anything to do with my two fleets. If prefer to use them to help you in the west and to potentially convoy your units as needed.","I would also talk to Han Solo about what is going to happen in Moscow.","Damn I wish we could call people rather than text but hey whatever","It\u2019s going to be hard to pull Yoda away from R2-D2. We have to really strategize how we pull the ultimate stab. We should gently work on loosening Yoda from R2-D2, but be prepared in case that doesn\u2019t happen.","Also no worries at all if not, but if you could support me into Paris that would be dope. No worries if you can\u2019t at all!","Let me know if you\u2019re cool with me temporarily putting my fleet in ska in the North Sea to block off Chewbacca. Chewbacca retreating their will screw things up big time. I have it set to move there right now, but I\u2019ll call it off immediately if you tell me to.","Yeah, I\u2019m pretty uncomfortable with you in the North Sea.","Let me think for a sec","We can bounce North Sea.","I\u2019m game. That serves the same end","It means I don\u2019t force channel though","Right that was my thought too.","I guess it just has to be that way.","Can you move ska to bal?","I mean den","Ska was gonna bounce the North Sea","Yeah, I\u2019m dumb","Did you work out Warsaw with R2-D2?","I mean he\u2019s not protesting me going after it but in all likelihood I won\u2019t get it till spring","We kinda need to make a big play in spring 1905 before Han Solo is totally destroyed","Will he support you in?","Han Solo is supporting me into Moscow in exchange for support in sev.","Why did you move to ska?","All that does is threaten Norway needlessly","Accidental move","I mean to go bal, but it\u2019s kinda inconsequential to me. I really don\u2019t have anything for those guys to do.","Except threaten me","But yeah I don\u2019t blame you for feeling suspicious","Yeah dude really total oversight. I\u2019m committed to this alliance.","How can you rectify it?","If you\u2019re scared I\u2019m happy to set something you like as good faith but I think I\u2019ve been pretty accurate to my word","Gez man","Whatever you want I literally have nothing to do with these units","I get it tho I felt the same last turn but like I don\u2019t want these kinda things to totally throw us off. I\u2019m  banking on you help stop R2-D2 and definitely have placed my trust in you","12 hours days","I\u2019m at a conference for work and can\u2019t really pay too much attention to this rn","But like in sort","I\u2019ll do what you want","But I don\u2019t like this tone of \u201chow will you rectify\u201d like I don\u2019t want any tension here","Ok, fair enough. I had one of those days too. It\u2019s a suspicious move but as long as we can figure out a way to get you back in Denmark we\u2019re cool.","I\u2019m totally game.","And like I said, no hard feelings here either. I think we\u2019ve both really committed to working together and so we\u2019re hypersensitive to getting stabbed","Here\u2019s my orders as they are set right now.\nBur>Par\nHold in Bel\nKie>Ruh\nBer>Pru\nSil>War\nSka>Den\nHold Sweden","Honestly it might be best to make a habit out of sharing and confirming our movesets to avoid problems like this. That way if there is a stab, there are no two ways about it.","Another thought - maybe, we agree that if we want to break the alliance after R2-D2 is subdued we have a one term armistice so we can regroup and prepare, once again to reduce risk of stab","F BAR - NWG\nF Lon - NTH\nA Pic - Bre\nA Stp - Mos\nF Wal H","Building an army in Edi so I can convoy to Norway. Going to push on the channel from North Sea.","If Luke Skywalker is smart, he\u2019ll disband Warsaw because it\u2019s dead no matter what. That will be annoying for st. Pete but we\u2019ll see.","R2-D2 is nervous of you. He\u2019s asking me to not support you into Warsaw. I\u2019m playing very coy. Happy to support you in but if you think we can use this for some duplicity why it try? I could tell him I\u2019ll help him out to keep him on my side for now. He sees that you will be \u201cpointlessly moving east.\u201d And you are a \u201cpoor player who doesn\u2019t deserve Warsaw.\u201d Clearly some threat there.","HAHAHAH now I really want him dead","Like why a dick? Does he think that we want his respect because he\u2019s some highly ranked dude? BS. As long as he loses, I\u2019m happy.","*what","He messaged me that he\u2019s confused why I won\u2019t move on Obi-Wan Kenobi","He just messaged me asking me to \u201ctalk tonight.\u201d","Whatever that means.","I hope we can troll him good","Good to know. Me too!","R2-D2 is trying to convince me that you will attack me lol","He\u2019s committed to joining forces against you. I\u2019ve stayed silent.","Thanks man.","Could you support me into Paris? Once I\u2019m there I can support you on the coast.","Sure","Thanks man! Much appreciated. How did your chat go with R2-D2?","Hey man how\u2019s it going?","R2-D2 is telling me things you apparently said about me","Trying to provoke me to attack you.","I haven\u2019t said a word to him","Keeping him in the dark","Smooth.","Ok, now he\u2019s trying to convince me that the only place for expansion is through you. Are you not planning on moving on him? I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t move into Munich.","I\u2019m moving on him in the spring after I get my two new builds.

Will you support pic into Brest?","Yes, I\u2019ve already set my orders to do so.","And yes army in Mun and Ber","Still wanna share orders?","Yeah for sure. Especially if we\u2019re going to turn on R2-D2 soon, we should be coordinating clearly","Have you been talking to Yoda or Han Solo?","I\u2019ve been talking to Han Solo but he realizes he\u2019s donezo","Don\u2019t be tempted by R2-D2.

Also, we should block Chewbaccas retreat in the North Sea.","I was supporting Armenia to sev","Nice.

I\u2019m now supporting you in Moscow.","Yoda is telling me that you and R2-D2 will team against me in Warsaw. I think this is R2-D2 trying to bait me into acting against you or him.","I\u2019m going to bounce Chewbacca out of the North Sea baring protest from you.

The truth is I still plan on supporting Han Solo however I don\u2019t have much of a plan after that. We need more armies up north.","I just realized that for that to work, Warsaw needs to hit Ukraine","Is that possible?","Geez, so many moving parts here.","If I don\u2019t hear from you 5 minutes before adjudication I\u2019ll just hold Moscow and deal with Han Solo and sev next year.","Hey just got out of a meeting","Glad to hear from you","My fear is that by hitting Ukraine, I provoke R2-D2 and become the aggressor. That makes it unlikely we can convince Yoda to stay neutral. At this point, I am almost hoping R2-D2 attacks me in some way so I can claim retaliation and blitzkrieg","Just read my message from R2-D2, he is thinking about taking Moscow.","He said \u201cbecause I am not hearing from Obi-Wan Kenobi...\u201d this was 9:05 am est so I assumed you have hammered it out since then.","*assume","Unless he stabs, yes","Sweet. IF he does stab, then we have an excuse to invade.","I\u2019m not going to try and convince you to move against R2-D2 if you don\u2019t want to. I do think however that if we can knock him out of sev we are on a much better strategic position. I\u2019ll plan on holding Moscow unless you say otherwise.","What can I do to knock him out of Sev on this turn?","I totally agree. There is nothing I rather do than deny him another build.","But I don\u2019t see how I can possibly stop him this turn. I had the same conversation with Han Solo.","You hit Ukraine. I support Armenia into sev. Black supports Armenia","Damn this is a tough call.","Well you let me know what you want to do and I\u2019ll plan around it. It\u2019s all up to you.","Maybe it\u2019s time to just go ahead and make the first strike. I alert him to my intentions, but deny him a build, which is far more important.","Still, the trade off is now he will be able to move against me in spring 1905 and that might be a big advantage.","But your builds will protect against that, no? Don\u2019t forget that by doing this Han Solo is still a contender","So with this move, his army in sev is forced to disband","Right","So do I hold or support?","If I hit R2-D2, what does our spring 1905 strategy look like?","I\u2019m playing around with the sandbox.","Our odds are better if Yoda stays out of it.

We give R2-D2 a heads up, he will defending the neutral ground","Yeah actually","We can\u2019t do it this turn, I\u2019m sorry. Once I get the jump on him in the spring I can force him to disband.

I need to find a couple builds. Brest is a lock. And I\u2019ll have to make sure Yoda is still on board with giving me Portugal. I\u2019d like to see more of my fleets pushing into the med and more of your armies pushing east. I don\u2019t have time to think about precise moves but just general strategy","Yes I agree.

{"messages":["Hey Han Solo - how is it going? Excited for this game!","Of course, yeah! Will see how things unfold","How are things going? Do you think R2-D2 or Luke Skywalker or going to be a problem?","For you or for me?","Do you know what Luke Skywalker is up to?","Have you heard from him??","I haven\u2019t","No I haven't either","Only person I haven\u2019t talked to so I don\u2019t have anything for you. I shared a lot of small talk with R2-D2 - seems like a nice guy but we won\u2019t have much shop to talk for the first couple turns.","Yeah, I think you'll be fine with R2-D2 initially","Have you talked to Chewbacca much?","I inquired about Yoda a little bit but not so much about other plans","How\u2019s it going Han Solo?","It does seem like Luke Skywalker has a deal with R2-D2, I was expecting A war - gal at least for some control on rumania","What do you think about R2-D2 and Yoda though?","They seem like nice guys. Very chatty","They seem like nice guys. Very chatty","Right I agree. Luke Skywalker seems to be going after me.","Why did the army in Pru halt?","Also, it's clear that R2-D2 is going to build 2 units in Tri and Vie. I think you should be cautious now that Rusia may withdraw some troops to Sev","He thought I was going to defend and decided not to anyway","Possibly. I\u2019m more focused on Chewbacca and Obi-Wan Kenobi at the moment","Okay, good luck with that. I think Luke Skywalker will move back for now so that'll hopefully be helpful int the short term","Looks like Luke Skywalker is finished... Any plans for the future? I'm not sure how long I can hold out here","I\u2019m still deciding what to do in Scandinavia","Well, if R2-D2 grabs warsaw, Luke Skywalker will probably disband that fleet","So just take Sweden?","Yeah, or you F Den S F Ska - Swe","Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t mind keeping Luke Skywalker alive on life support","Or the same for norway. Perhaps that Obi-Wan Kenobi scares you more","Exactly.","Just note that Stp can suport F NTH - Nwy","Thanks for the reminder","OMG","\ud83d\ude03","I could bait Obi-Wan Kenobi to doing that then snipe the North Sea lol","So unless Luke Skywalker cuts support","But perhaps he is vengeful and willing to help? I'm not sure","Well, he could even just convoy to norway and support that","if you disrupt the convoy then clearly you are not attacking norway.","Yeah.","If he is distracted with F NTH though it is likely Chewbacca can move into the channel","Is that so bad?","Man R2-D2 is gonna win this isn\u2019t he?","It's not bad for you, since Chewbacca seems to want use that to invade Obi-Wan Kenobi perhaps","Exactly.","but he made a big mistake with moves in spring","R2-D2?","Or Chewbacca?","Chewbacca I think. The A spa -Mar got stopped","And that cascaded to portugal.","If he had moved A spa-gas and A por-spa, he could easily A Gas S A spa - Mar now","Yup :\/","Well, except for your dude there","Yoda wants my support into Chewbacca","Anyhow, we should try to sort something with Yoda if we can in case R2-D2 gets too strong","Those two are tight.","Not entirely. He did not move F Nap - Ion","which would've been very bad for me since he could then convoy to Syr","I'm trying to win him over and I think he realizes too that if R2-D2 gets the whole east that doesn't bode well","He claimed to be the #1 diplomacy player online to me too","Idk if that's true but I wouldn't underestimate him","R2-D2?","Yep","I\u2019m not surprised. Admin told me that someone in here is the top player.","What if we all just ganged up. Even if I lose knowing I helped beat the best player in the world would be dope lol","I mean, I'll believe it, he got all of {Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Yoda} on his hand for the first few years :p","Yeah, I basically had the same idea \ud83d\ude03 Well, except for the losing part","Mwhhaha","Dang","Like, once you sort things out with Chewbacca\/Obi-Wan Kenobi, you'll be frree to move east. I can probably survive a few turns but anyway you should not expect the peac in the east to last especially since R2-D2 will get 1 or 2 builds in winter","I agree.","Do you have any ideas on how to free up some resources?","My resources?","A deal with Obi-Wan Kenobi where I get the North Sea.","Ok, but he'd want a way to get his troops across into Chewbacca at least. So he needs the channel","I don't he will be satisfied to twiddle his thumbs in Pic.","think*","Perhaps a situation where both of you don't occupy NTH is ok?","Then there is a buffer zone both ways.","Actually, it's probably fast to ally with Chewbacca but it's up to you","Yeah that was my original plan but he\u2019s unresponsive","My other option is to just gun for Obi-Wan Kenobi. It risks an R2-D2 win, but could allow me rapid growth, especially if I take Norway and then the North Sea next turn.","Yeah, though I'm inclined to think he will move his fleet to norway since it's fall. But in effect he will be giving up the channel, allowing Chewbacca to move his troops","Either way, Obi-Wan Kenobi is weakened","Exactly. I still get one build. Sucks that I can\u2019t focus on R2-D2, but his terms were not sufficient.","Good luck then. I'll try to not die","Okay you\u2019re idea actually revived talks","(An open North Sea armistice)","Hey you still online?","I'm back","I'd like to make some plans with regards to R2-D2 if you are able to help out","Totally in","Cool","If you can make a move toward warsaw to begin with that would be beneficial to both of us I think","As soon as R2-D2 has to take 1 or two armies off to protect the west, I think I can push in a little bit","Yes. I\u2019m attacking Warsaw this turn and will take it by next turn at the latest. R2-D2 is going to support Yoda into Smyrna or at least that\u2019s what he told me","I want to take Paris and Warsaw next turn. Once I have those two extra builds, Luke Skywalker is largely taken by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Chewbacca is put to bed. My plan is to move on R2-D2. I don\u2019t want Yoda to turn against us, but if he does I was Obi-Wan Kenobi to be strong enough to help hold him off.","I would have a conversation with Obi-Wan Kenobi about what will happen with Moscow. He is a friend and I trust him.","Good luck on everything man. The longer you can hold out the more time Obi-Wan Kenobi and I have to build.","I'm not sure if this is a good plan: Maybe you can cut A Gal S Rum such that I can A Sev - Rum with support from Bla","This turn?","Yeah. I'm not sure if you have anything else you want to do with A Sil ?","Or maybe keep up appearances","Gonna give Warsaw a shot","exactly. My plan is to let me and Obi-Wan Kenobi get as strong as possible while R2-D2 thinks we\u2019re his pals","If either me or Obi-Wan Kenobi attack moscow, the attack on warsaw will fail","If I don't get + 1 command center this turn I will need to disband 1 unit and R2-D2 gets plus 1. I'm quite scared of caving in with just 4 units","I\u2019m scared too tbh. I feel like you\u2019re Churchill here and if you lose that unit it could be the beginning of the end","I've made a few bets and it's allowed me to survive so far. But some time the coin will land on the other side","I\u2019m hoping you can keep him busy until spring 1905","That may be wishful thinking","But I don\u2019t feel prepared for a full assault yet","Still if your just hanging on, once we start hitting him from the north and east, you might be able to reclaim builds quickly","I think the best path forward is to wait and see what happens this turn, and if things get too hairy we gotta pull the trigger","Like, if this turn I bet wrong on what's gonna attack what. I'll probably lose another center.","2 instead of 1 or just one?","We may be able to work out some intel","I'm not sure R2-D2 would feel compelled to give you accurate intel on the moves in the southeast","Right. But we may be able to get something. Even if he lies we can potentially make deductions from his lies. Do you guys talk at all?","Barely. For the opposite reason (me giving away stuff)","Also, Obi-Wan Kenobi has never responded to me","I've also been amazed at how deaf Yoda has been to my chat about him having nothing to gain from R2-D2 winning basically all of Han Solo","Yes, why is Yoda so strongly joined at the hip with R2-D2? It seems unlikely that we will be able to pry him away unfortunately","On multiple occasions has he been vaguely agreeable with my arguments to then try to stab me anyhow","Also, like if your intel on the Smy attack is correct that changes a lot of things for me (in options)","Like, from the outset that seems a relatively risky choice.","Well, at least there's a way to force a stalemate from this position but I still lose 1 dude (and R2-D2 gains one)","Yoda supposedly is upset with R2-D2. We'll see how it goes","Really? Why? Do you think it\u2019s a ploy? If we can enlist Yoda then there is no reason not to move on R2-D2 immediately","He's claimed to want to move against R2-D2 in various ways before to then try to stab me anyway. It had been only plays for me to lower my guard. I wouldn't trust him unless he makes the first move.","Agreed.","So this time I tried going into various strategies in why moving against R2-D2 isn't as hard as he thinks it is. But he's acting not convinced. Anyway, I think there may be a path where we convince him to move together against R2-D2 but it's not clear how to trust Yoda after all that he's done before and how closely allied he's been to R2-D2","I agree. I would wait for some secondary evidence from Obi-Wan Kenobi or me before trusting him to turn on R2-D2","It is unfortunate but I do not have winning moves remaining","This is unfortunate if that\u2019s true","I mean, it\u2019s depends on when we can turn on R2-D2","Yes, that's true. However, if they play it right, as things stand, then there is no way for me to push forward without me losing something. Basically, without that 5th army the status quo is again slightly in their favor. Probably I will lose a unit every year ish, if not faster by the time I only have a few left","Perhaps together with Obi-Wan Kenobi I can hold the status quo but we'll see how that goes.","Could you attack Ukr with War? I suspect it will support Sev so it can hold against my supported attack","No, I already agreed to support Moscow with that unit , and he is supporting you into sev. I don\u2019t want to turn on R2-D2 until the spring.","Hm, that's another course of action he has huh. But he's not greedy so I'm not sure he'd do that.","Obi-Wan Kenobi told me he was gonna support you into Sev","I believe him but it's not enough if R2-D2 plays defensively and supports sev from Ukr and Rom","Then if I do go on the offensive it's very likely I lose something in my mainland.","So gambling on R2-D2 being greedy is the wrong move imo","Unless I can guarantee that I capture Sev.","Hmm. It\u2019s your call. I would love to prevent R2-D2 from getting another build","Right. Is that possible?","Only if you cut his support support, unfortunately","And do what?","But, if you attack ukr with warsaw you'd also cut R2-D2's support on a possible att on mosocow","So basically it's two birds with one stone.","I can get into Sev and you prevent a possible attack on moscow","I made a commitment to Obi-Wan Kenobi already, so you have to convince him.","I'll try and message him","Look, it's very likely that A gal - war to cut your support if he makes an aggressive move","Then the only thing saving moscow is if I attack Sev","See https:\/\/www.backstabbr.com\/sandbox\/6340894809128960\/1904\/fall","If I don't attack sev here, moscow would fall","Hmmm","I don\u2019t see what I can do to shift the equation","Actually, you're right","I may hit Ukraine to allow you to retake Sev.","Sure, let's give it a try","So are you going to move on ukr in spring?","No me and Obi-Wan Kenobi we thinking about jumping the gun in a last ditch effort to save sev","But this turn I think (if I have the balls to do it) I\u2019m going to just dive into R2-D2","And lets the chips fall where they may","Great! I'm still coming up with their likely game plan. I'd like to not lose 2 centers in Han Solo by winter if I can prevent it","What is your plan surrounding Ukr and Gal?","No idea I literally haven\u2019t thought this thru","I\u2019m hoping you and Obi-Wan Kenobi can come up with a good strategy here","I will get support from Obi-Wan Kenobi to attack Sev. If you do A War- Ukr that will succeed and one of R2-D2's armies there will be disbanded","That\u2019s great news","So you're ready to help?","Yes- let me set my orders","I will help you retake sev. But I cannot hit Ukraine until the fall. I have to sure up my hold in Warsaw and my path into Vienna. I hope that is acceptable.","Yo","Ack","Did you request Obi-Wan Kenobi to not support my attack?","I asked him to support Warsaw with the understanding that we will both support you into sev this turn.","I couldn\u2019t help you in the spring because I risked losing Warsaw which would set the whole war on R2-D2 behind","I would've been happy to attack Rum or similar in this turn, which would make it much harder for R2-D2 to hold warsaw or Vienna at the same time, even if you had lost warsaw in spring. There's no way R2-D2 could've held warsaw with you getting some support from Obi-Wan Kenobi (attack of 3 strenght)","That could be right, idk. But let\u2019s focus on helping you take Sev this turn.","Hey Han Solo - one of my big goals is to make sure you get another build in 1906. I think most likely this will be doable in Rum.","I have to ask you something tho","Sure, what is it?","Just keep me posted if you hear any wind that people are going to gang up on me. Now that I have 10 units and they all have 7 I\u2019m a bit worried","I\u2019m thinking king we may be able to have you take Rum this year","Yeah I'm also considering Bul but I need to defend Ank as well","When did you want to move on Rum?","Maybe fall","What are the plans in fall?","Can you support my unit in War into Ukraine. I will use him to support you into Rom","Congrats on the big retake!","I feel like I turned on R2-D2 just in time to save you haha","Hi, sorry for the tardyness. I've just had a really busy weekend \ud83d\ude42","Yeah, thanks. Slowly getting back into the game","No worries. Would you feel comfortable supporting me into Rom? Then in the spring I\u2019ll move to Budapest and you can take rom","I think it makes slightly more sense for me to take it this turn, because you won\u2019t have the physical spaces to build two new units","While I'm not entirely opposed to this proposition I don't have time to fully consider it today nor tomorrow. I will just stay as I am for now","Can you support me into rom?","Or are you working with R2-D2?","I'm not working with R2-D2, I'm just not doing anything.","Down to support you into rom","I\u2019m going to hit rom unless you want it.","What\u2019s good man - hoping to chat before adjudication","Hey, you still around?","Yes","I'm back from travels!","Nice man welcome back!","Okay, so rum sound good! I can follow up with my troops from mainland Han Solo as well before winter. What is your side of this?","What would you like me to do for you?","So I\u2019m happy to support you into Rum! But I would like you to support me into in Bud next turn if that\u2019s cool?","Ok, fair enough. I'm a bit worried about englend going for Sev, though. Do you think he'll stay at moscow?","Ukraine is supporting Sev into Rum","Yes, I\u2019ll make sure of it.","You are totally safe from Obi-Wan Kenobi. We are in a position where if he fucks me he will get fucked twice as hard","Ok great. I'm supporting with the fleet as well.","Perfect. I can\u2019t support with Gal because I need to protect Vienna","But I\u2019m supporting you from Ukraine","Sure, yeah. I'm considering what he will gamble on. If you push into bud with +1 support then we either get bud or rum probably","I\u2019m going to push into bud in the fall with your support from Rum and my support from Vienna","But it will be easier once you\u2019re in Rum","That will break the egg of R2-D2","Ok! It hinges on serbia's support though","How so?","If both bud and serbia support rum then the attack will fail.","F Bel\nA Boh S Tyr\nA Bur - Mun\nA Gal - Bud\nF Hol\nA Par H\nA Tyr - Tri\nA Ukr S Sev - Rum\nA Vie S Gal - Bud\nA War - Gal","Here\u2019s my moves right now","Happy to update them","Ah ok, that looks good.","As long as there's an attack on Bud as well.","Sweet","I really am kinda incentivised to hit him hard","No, I believe you. We're all set up for this.","Congrats on the pickup! I\u2019m so siked that we were able to turn the tables on R2-D2.","Would you be down to talk longer term strategy soon?","Yeah, whew that was close for me for a short while. Thanks","Lol R2-D2 just reached out to me saying he would support me into Rum lmfao","He got really mad at me","I\u2019m sure dude","We just need to put him to bed at this point","It's just a game. Like, i don't get it","He\u2019s too intense it\u2019s wack","He like found my IRL name","Which really freaked me out","There's some names on the info tab of the game I guess","actually, if you go to <#601857887098372112> and click on your user, you'll see","But the fact that they went to the effort... I don't know","Sore loser I guess","Just weird to me that\u2019s all","We have a break over the weekend but you still want me to support you into Bud?","Galicia correct?","Yes please!!!","I thanks man.","no problem.","Are you going to take bulg? I\u2019m playing with the sandbox and unfortunately, we can\u2019t take bud until one other territory falls.","If he puts all support on bud I will get bul.","Yeah I think we bluff that we\u2019re going for bud. I won\u2019t get it this turn, but will you help me get it next turn?","Well that literally couldn\u2019t have gone better.","I\u2019m thinking I take Serb and you can have Greece if that\u2019s cool with you?","Can you help me with Yoda then?","Potentially! As long as we can agree to some broader armistice. I don\u2019t want to focus on fighting you. We just toppled R2-D2 together and plus Han Solo is mega hard to take with out a Mediterranean fleet... but we could cause problems for each other if we don\u2019t work something out.","Hey Han Solo what\u2019s good","Hey I'm around","What up man","I'll try and get greece but it's not guaranteed","Okay no worries","Can  you support me into Serb","Tri > Serb","I can't, sorry","It\u2019s okay I appreciate your honesty","What are you thinking more long term","I'm hoping to set up a convoy to naples, I think","What\u2019s your plan for the army in Rum","Fortify my lines","Fair. I\u2019m not interested in going after you, I just want Serbia","Do you want Moscow","Happy to support you in","I can't","Y"],"sender_labels":[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],"receiver_labels":[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,false,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,false,"NOANNOTATION",true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,false,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,false,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,false,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,false,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,"NOANNOTATION",true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,false,true,true,true,true],"speakers":["Darth

Sorry for the delay - still getting the hang of this app. Why do you think we should bounce in Bur?","To start, I'd like us to have a good relationship, so I'm starting by telling you what I'm going to do, which is move an Army to Burgundy, ideally to bounce. This allows me to protect in case you were planning on doing something to begin with. Second, bouncing helps you out because Darth Vader's first move with the Munich army is either to move to Burgundy or the Ruhr. If you dont move to Bur, then I'm there and you have to move the Ruhr army back to protect Mun anyway. I think we both have other issues than creating a relatively pointless stalemate here when there are better targets if we work together","Interesting. I will have to think it over.

Luke Skywalker also is not very communicative.","What\u2019s your strategy regarding Obi-Wan Kenobi","Try to survive for now I guess, was hoping Luke Skywalker wouldn't fall flat on their face in Scandinavia. I'll consolidate and try and support you against an Obi-Wan Kenobi attack in Belgium after winter","Luke Skywalker tells me that we will hold in Pru - not sure to believe him but I think it\u2019s a little early to start screwing people.","Do you mind if I move into Ruh to support a potential future attack on bel","Yeah that should be fine","I\u2019m going to move Mun to Ber instead.

I'll help you out but you need to take him on with me","You still there? I would love to talk about the future","Yea I\u2019m here. I\u2019m with you on that. Not cutting my fleet and I\u2019ll work with you. What\u2019s the next Step? He was talking about leaving Sev to Romania which was prolly BS.","he may try, but I wouldn't trust that.","Even if he tries to move up to Moscow I can bounce him back to Sev anyway.","He can't get Rumania anyway","I don't think he will","He wants to consolidate his units","What\u2019s the plan then if I keep the fleet in the Black Sea?","I'm getting information now","I'll let you know tomorrow?","Ok, sounds good.","With Han Solo building another fleet in Black Sea I have to do something with my fleet there or it could be destroyed.","So we're going to move your fleet to Rumania here","Supported by me","Ok sounds good.","Can we just check plans here? I'm supporting you into Rum, correct?","Yea I have my fleet from Black Sea moving there next turn,","Awesome","Fuck, I did not expect T to go for Rum here","Sorry you didn't get in","It\u2019s fine. Looks like you\u2019ll be fighting the war in the south alone for a bit.","What's your focus this fall?","There\u2019s not much I can do really other than hold as I only have 2 units.","Darth Vader is a dick.  I told him not to do that","Yea, he is. I fucked up this game. Was my first time as Luke Skywalker and I pushed to pressure Darth Vader way too early. Oh well.","I could tell you were a new Luke Skywalker, but that's not bad.  We'll get em later this game :)","Come over to the Nexus! It's a large Diplomacy server with a great community and good gameplay.  You'll get a lot better there in prep for your next game","https:\/\/discord.gg\/P5vyvz8","Seems everyone is fight8bg each other in the West and picking apart Chewbacca. Should give you a lot of room to operate in the east before you start taking them on.","Trying hard","Are you going after Warsaw next turn?","Darth Vader says he is.  I would like to bounce him if possible and I told him I would too.  I need you to keep that center","Ok thanks. I was going to move Moscow there to bounce anyone but now I\u2019ll just have Moscow Hold next turn.","Doesn\u2019t look like Darth Vader can move to Warsaw next  turn anyway.","We're not allowed to share screenshots, but he said he's moving on Warsaw next turn","Dammit dude, had you trusted me I would have put you into Stp this year","Yea I know. I\u2019ve been screwed over a lot this game though haha. My bad.","It works out anyway because Luke Skywalker moved on you regardless, but you need him to move out","Make it CLEAR to Luke Skywalker that you're dying to Obi-Wan Kenobi if he doesn't turn around and take Obi-Wan Kenobi on","Darth Vader needs to turn around","Yea. I\u2019m moving back to Moscow so it should be ok as long as I don\u2019t get bounced.","I\u2019m pretty impressed by how well Obi-Wan Kenobi is doing tbh. It\u2019s not always easy for them to do well.","They're good at manipulating Darth Vader.  Good at nothing else.","Haha, good for them. Darth Vader was pissing me off earlier.","Back to Mos here?","Yea, back to Mos.","Kk"],"sender_labels":[true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true],"receiver_labels":["NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,false,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,"NOANNOTATION","NOANNOTATION",true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,false,false,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION",true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,true,"NOANNOTATION"],"speakers":["R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2"],"receivers":["Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker","R2-D2","Luke Skywalker"],"absolute_message_index":[8,18,246,248,254,256,259,264,265,290,291,292,316,427,438,439,440,630,643,719,720,722,723,724,725,726,727,729,730,731,732,747,785,786,788,814,816,817,909,910,911,912,922,1467,1468,1469,1470,1471,1548,1549,1555,1556,1557,1558,1559,1587,1616,1617,1618,1619,1620,1621,1622,1623,1749,1811,1813],"relative_message_index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66],"seasons":["Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Winter","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Spring","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall","Fall"],"years":["1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1901","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1902","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903","1903"],"game_score":["3","3","4","3","4","3","3","4","3","4","4","3","4","3","4","3","4","5","3","5","5","3","5","3","5","5","5","3","5","5","3","3","5","5","3","5","3","5","5","5","3","5","3","5","3","5","5","5","2","6","2","6","2","2","6","6","2","6","6","6","2","2","6","2","6","2","6"],"game_score_delta":["-1","-1","1","-1","1","-1","-1","1","-1","1","1","-1","1","-1","1","-1","1","2","-2","2","2","-2","2","-2","2","2","2","-2","2","2","-2","-2","2","2","-2","2","-2","2","2","2","-2","2","-2","2","-2","2","2","2","-4","4","-4","4","-4","-4","4","4","-4","4","4","4","-4","-4","4","-4","4","-4","4"],"players":["R2-D2","Luke Skywalker"],"game_id":2}
{"messages":["Hey Obi-Wan Kenobi!  Looking forward to playing with you! How's your afternoon going so far?","So far so good. Have you worked anything out with Han Solo and Luke Skywalker yet? What you decide to do with Luke Skywalker will heavily influence what I do.","I haven't actually talked with Luke Skywalker yet.  The board has been too quiet for my liking. Han Solo texted me once but hasn't responded.","I'm fineoving against Luke Skywalker if I can be assured that Yoda won't pose a threat.  The two of us are in a great position to be allies, if you influence Yoda on my behalf and I influence Luke Skywalker on yours...","I\u2019m happy to help. I\u2019ll talk to Yoda and open. North.","Where are you thinking about moving?","Not sure yet. I can see you\u2019re all in anti Luke Skywalker or Han Solo. Decided to leave the Darth Vaders alone?","For now.  I can take on Luke Skywalker if you do Chewbacca","You have a deal","You're fighting a good fight.  I'm sending Yoda around to help you out with Chewbacca","Darth Vader is becoming a problem. Where do you stand with them?","Darth Vader and I have chatted more than you and I have but I'm more occupied with the East","Why?","Also what's the deal with Chewbacca?","Why what?","Chewbacca is putting up a little fight.","What\u2019s happening with you and Han Solo?","Han Solos done","As is Luke Skywalker","Good take of STP","Chewbacca is such a dumbass","You taking Mos here?","Possibly","You think?","Lol, realized I never gave the thumbs up or thumbs down so the message never sent.","Han Solo is donezo","I need you to keep Darth Vader from getting Moscow. I don't care if you get it or not, but Darth Vader is playing a poor game and it shouldn't be rewarded.","Are you asking me to support Warsaw or not support Darth Vader in? Those are two different requests.","Ideally you take Darth Vader on while he's shifting his stuff pointlessly east","I can support it. Just don't support him in","Why is it pointless? How does that benefit me?","He was moving on Luke Skywalker so he could reap the rewards of the Tsar's fall.  It wasn't the cause of any good will towards you.  He's an opportunist and with Chewbacca locked up by you and Yoda and Luke Skywalker increasingly locked up by you and Han Solo, there's only one place for him to attack","He's asked me many times about the best way to attack you, and was setting up for it until I told him Luke Skywalker was done.","Would love to sit down and talk tonight","Sure thing","Can we talk long term here? What's the goal of the game? Where do you go now, with Han Solo and Darth Vader at the extent of your border?","Would love to talk for a bit","I'll take on Darth Vader with you, but we need to talk it out.  We can't do it alone","Are you online? We need to talk really quick","Sorry, busy week","You free for a bit now? I'm at work but can carry on an infrequent convo","Sure","Asking honestly, what are your plans for expansion now? Luke Skywalker is gone, Chewbacca nearly so. Where do you go next?","Trying to fend you off and sweep up the rest of Chewbacca. Not sure much past that.","At least you're honest \ud83d\ude02","Let's get real here, you and I are the best players on this board.  I don't know how you got Darth Vader to work with you, but you're obviously a diplomatic force to be reckoned with.  I'm willing to help you get a leg up on G here","You've shut yourself out of most of your expansion opportunities except for Darth Vader, but I can lend an assisting hand if you take him on","I want to see you succeed here, good play should be rewarded","I can get you Warsaw here","What happens after Warsaw?","You finish Darth Vader, I finish Han Solo","You then finish Chewbacca, I help out by taking Yoda","That's a stalemate line and a draw if we do it right","Thoughts?","Interesting proposition. My biggest concern is that I\u2019ve left myself open to Darth Vader in the north. Grabbing Warsaw would ensure that I lose Norway and he has a clear path to my island.","Darth Vader trusts you after that support into Paris.  Now is the time to move and take advantage of that.  I can support you into Warsaw if you need","Right now I'm just planning to defend Sev, I have no plans to open up additional fronts against you. I have enough enemies as is","Still there?","Well actions will speak here. Let\u2019s see how things shake out this year.","I need to be sure that you're not supporting Han Solo against me here or I'll just take Moscow.  There's too much on the line for us to just wait this out","It\u2019s hard to build trust in this game quickly. I understand the urgency though.","Thanks","I would really appreciate affirmation about your not helping Han Solo back in","I can\u2019t flip on Darth Vader until we have a more established relationship. If we want to build that we need to take small leaps of faith. I will not support Han Solo. Please do not take Moscow. If that goes, we can start planning more seriously against Darth Vader","That works for me.  Thanks for checking in","Thank you","Did you ask Darth Vader to take the North Sea?","Hey, if Darth Vader invaded you without your permission, I'm all in with you.","He's now the largest on the map with free access to Norway and Edinburgh.  Let's start pushing back on hin","Can we talk about Darth Vader for a sec?","yes, i'm sorry i've been ignoring you","Hahaha I get worried sometimes","I've been trying to talk to him but things seem to be breaking down","what do you have in mind?","How so?","The dude needs to be taken out for any of us to have a chance.  He has the most SCs on the board and potential to take more from you, whcih I don't want to see","neither do I, but i'm not sure what we can coordinate together","Let's talk about Warsaw","what you thinking?","One of us has to move into it by the end of the year. Darth Vader is building to move against me, Han Solo is still a pain in the butt, and Yoda is getting testy.  I need your help to crack this dude, and I can't be running damage control for the board on my own","can we wait until the fall?","We really shouldn't wait.  I've watched him amass power and move into every sector of the board without resistance","What do you want to wait for?","Just curious","I want to see how he moves before I full on stab him","Let's imagine if he moves into Edinburgh and towards Norway....at that point it's too late to respond.","Berlin will be in PLuke Skywalker by that time, holding Warsaw against any of our attacks and threatening your single unit covering both Moscow and St Petersburg","That's a two center pickup at that point and no one can stop him.  This move could determine the game.  I don't want to see us sleeping on the next three movesets","Thoughts?  I know this is a lot to process, but I've seen a lot of Diplomacy games, and I've had some go south on its participants very quickly","And I really want to finalize my moveset before midnight","sorry, i'm on the west coast and still at work and still slammed","give me an hour","Good deal","Anything?","Yes","I managed to piss Darth Vader off for you \ud83d\ude09","Darth Vader is talking to me about heading back","How do?","So","Heading back for what?","I need to sleep soon","You ask for a pause?","Trying to decide if it's worth staying up for","Any final thoughts?","I submitted","What should I expect?","You want support into Warsaw?","I\u2019m supporting you","We'll find out in two seconds","I\u2019m not supporting you","Yeah I said that you lied on the last message lol","Lol","Not a bad turn for us I guess","Could have gone a lot worse","Glad that I at least got him to mess up your convoy lol","Small wins","What\u2019s the plan now?","You seem pretty well entrenched","That\u2019s a fair observation","Is there any point in talking? We know what the other wants, and those wants are at odds.  It's going to be a N\/S stalemate line for the rest of the game unless Yoda or Han Solo screws up","What do you think I want?","If you didn't want to take advantage of G earlier, you missed your chance.  The fronts will just solidify from now on","So what do you think I want then?","Hopefully you want to draw this out at this point.  Unless Yoda fucks up, that's what should be happening","A kinda sad end to what was a good start","Interesting. Not sure that\u2019s what I want.","Why don't you tell me then","Well of course (as anyone) I\u2019d like to solo but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in the cards. I\u2019d like to see things shake up once the battle lines are drawn. Not sure if we\u2019re there yet though.","That mostly comes from Darth Vader in the east","As far as Tyr and Marseilles go","\ud83d\ude3a","Sharing a face palm with the world i see","I hate

{"messages":["Hey Han Solo! How are you doing? Looking forward to working with you this game!","You there? Would love to talk strategy at some point","Hey R2-D2, yeah, I'm around","Good to hear from you! How's your night?","I'm kind of getting the grips on this game","No worries! Are you friend of admin?","Yep, get dragged into a lotta things. Must say this is kind of out there","Anyway, Luke Skywalker is kind of scary. They start with 4 units","You play Diplomacy before?","Yeah they are.  I'd love to take him out asap honestly","I'm not sure I can do that much but I'm happy to help","If you trust me, I can coach us both through advantageously","You don't know who I am, but I was the #1 player on the Diplomacy app Conspiracy and I run the largest only Diplomacy tournament in the world, so I can coach us both through to a pretty good result","Ah that's cool. Yeah I'm afraid I'm gonna get stuck in a snag somewhere.","In general I was hoping to at least take the black sea and kind of capture the supply center in bulgaria","I'm not so sure about what to do beyond that","Those are both good starts.  I suggest sending that second unit to Armenia","It will make the attack on Luke Skywalker far more effective in the future","Like setting up a move sequence in chess","I read that sending the smy to constantinople was good","Yeah, that's a typical move too","The Arm sequence indicates a hard commit against Luke Skywalker, which is why it's not quite as often used, but I'm hard commiting against Luke Skywalker so I would love for you to do the same","I'm happy to support you if I can get sevastopol","That's the hope!","How would the army to armenia play out? I suppose the fleet in sevastopol either goes to black sea or rumania. Probably black sea... Do you plan to go to Rumania first?","I wasn't planning to go to Rum first, should I?","Alright, will you be able to provide support to attack sevastopol?","Can I do it in the next spring? I'm not adjacent to Sev here","I could go to Rum for some more support to assault sevastopol?","You could.  I suggest it","That went pretty well","lol, amazing","Good work!","Glad to see Luke Skywalker down a peg here","Nothing? Whats the plan here? Unfortunate for the two of us that Luke Skywalker left that fleet in the Black Sea :\/","Yeah I'm not sure what his play is. Luke Skywalker seems very inconsistent","I think I'll need a few turns before I could move north to attack Luke Skywalker though. What is a good plan from here?","Looks like you're pretty committed North already, the fleet builds sold it","You're in a good spot.  You should take the Black Sea here, that will give you a ton of leverage in the future","So are we just coordinating anymore? You might as well just tell me you want to attack me","Hi! I'm actually away from home so I haven't been paying too close attention yet.","Yeah I'll take care of that fleet in Bla. Then with +1 support it should be easy to move on to mos","Looks like we were always at war with Eurasia after all","Seems as if.  What's the plan?","Poor Luke Skywalker","I feel bad but I ended up going to sleep before I got a response from you so I figured you were out to attack me","Very poor Luke Skywalker.  The worst possible start","You squeezed him too hard and now he's dead \ud83d\ude26","I didn't squeeze him haha","But yeah, we had a good mutual effort there","Mutual, as in, he got his stuff destroyed while he got walked over huh","I mean, he's partially to blame of course","Anyway, i don't think I'm doing too badly for my first gae","I haven't \"attacked\" you so far either nor have I had the opportunity to","besides claiming centers that are close to me","You're not doing badly!","Just need to keep that momentum going","Eh, I'm good with what I have\/had.","An attack of strength ~~3~~ 4: for when you really really really ~~really~~ want that region \ud83d\ude2d","Yeah.....","Yoda is such a pain in my ass","I must say I agree","You online?","Yep","It's going poorly for me but I'm a rational player so if you wanna suggest something go ahead","I'm thinking. It's tough because I'd rather keep it clean than overtly lie to you, I'm not that type of player. Honestly, you're in a tough spot","Sure am","You request the pause?","So believe it or not, I may actually have to work with you if I don't want E or G to win","I believe you because I can see that happening too","So plan out a fair strategy.  Wouldn't be surprised if you were mad but I'm willing to put some of that shit behind for the good of the game and the players on the losing end of it","Alright, but here's the thing. 2\/3 of Han Solo is occupied by you and Yoda. So the payment would come out of your own pocket","Like, I'm willing to look beyond there and consider maybe Luke Skywalker or Yoda","I'm willing to sacrifice a little but not much.  I'm the main line of defense against Darth Vader rn.","At least you're semi reasonable about it.  Many aren't","I also don't want Darth Vader to win. And I can see that you're being pressured","If you were to fall to Darth Vader (completely) that would be bad for me too","Right","My guess is they're looking to draw it out at this point unless someone has a 1909 stab","Englad is getting some reinforcements to Stp now","Yeah, I see.  We need to move this turn","Honestly I should have reached out last turn but I thought I had a good guess left in me","i think if we can come to a nonagression accross the Han Solo Straits that would be beneficial for both of us","You can use the armies stationed there now for your defense while I rebuild and attempt to go north","That's fine","If you are okay with that then I will take Con, build an army in Ank and then take Smy","You don't need Con and Amy right now.  This only works if we give up what we have to.  I can give you Con, but your units won't have anywhere to go after that, esp if we can't break you out of Sev here","Is this about moscow? I don't have a way to hold onto that yet.","Yeah, but we have to move fast, esp as that Obi-Wan Kenobi reinforcement is coming soon","As they lock down, we need to move fast and keep them guessing","If I would be able to take Moscow with you support then in Fall I would be surrounded by three angry armies","Is there a step two to this plan?","Frankly, I'm not sure we get far anyway, but we don't get anywhere if Moscow is supported by STP next turn","I can see what you're saying but I am not afforded the luxury of a gamble at this point in the game","You're not, but you won't later either.  You can still hold Moscow with your fleet plus my army, and worst comes to worst, your army would be loose behind their front.  The alternative is we continue to attack you and we all lost out.  Yoda, me, you","I don't want to play that game","I think the only way I can hold moscow is if you move A rum - Sev while I go to moscow. Then next turn we can hold it.","For you to hold Rum, then, you'd retreat A Con - Bul simultaneously","Of course my fleet cannot support my army in moscow","Why not? Genuinely curous","Oh, never","I misread your statement","Oh, so give me your moves right now, I want to confirm this. I have to sleep in a sec","I'm not going for moscow. It's too far of a stretch at the moment","Hey, I'm going to be away for a bit but just wanted to prod you prior to that about plans.","I hope to stay neutral for now though I'm not sure what Darth Vader & Obi-Wan Kenobi will think of that","To be upfront with you, I'm not particularly happy with your moveset","I gave you Con to solidify our line and you not only didn't do that, but you attacked the remaining stalemate ally","What do you mean by solidify the line?","Against the Darth Vaders and the Obi-Wan Kenobi?","I think we agreed to a ceasefire? The moscow plan was very wild at the time. I'm going to be busy for two days so I'll stay as I am for a bit and not attack any positions.","I plan to build a fleet in Con unless you have a better idea. I do not plan to do anything with said fleet. It's just for my own protection.","I'm read to attempt some push in the coming year if you have a suggestion","For example, I could attempt A Sev- Ukr after I move A Smy-Arm","Such that in the season after I can do a supported attack on moscow or something else.","You're a dick dude.  I will make sure that that's the last one you take.  I'll let E\/G walk over me of I have to","I don't understand why people kill their own chances to survive games.  What's wrong with holding the line? It's so frustrating playing with players that would rather sabotage themselves than work with a teammate","You exist because of me.  And you made a terrible, terrible strategic move","Good
